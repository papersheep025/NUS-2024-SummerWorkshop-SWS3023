Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,30-Jul-22,"Daal Keema fry & pala paneer were good  Mix tandoor sizzler has no prawns though it's listed under prawns in the menu. It had a great smoky flavour even before the sauce was dumped on it.  Briyani rice looked off but tasted about right. Kashmiri naan: the oil glistened & it was nice & moist. It tasted decent (if you like sweet naan you'll love it). It's not as sweet as other kashmiri naan I've had.  Orange Lassi was thick, concentrated & sweet. Cardamon Lassi was ok (not sweet)"
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,5,20-May-23,Very good Pakistani restaurant. I ate chicken tandoori taste was very good & delicious. But they don't even No their restaurant is listed in yelp lol . Price average according to Singapore. Recommended
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,22-Mar-16,"Cash only. I hate cash only places.  Cleanliness was questionable. Service was great though. I had a problem when ordering because I wanted the butter chicken, garlic naan, and tandoori chicken but knew I need to pick just one *sad face*  We ordered and paid then got seated.  Since the food was cooked and in their respective hot-held trays, the food came out super fast. I ended up ordering the biryani rice and chicken tandoori. They have many different kinds of naans...  The chicken was tender, flavorful, and juicy. You can taste the turmeric and cumin in the biryani rice. Glad I opted for this rather than plain white rice. I ended up not getting any naan. There is a pitcher of water on each table. Seems like no one in Singapore drinks iced water. Thankfully I had a bottle of cold water w/ me because we came straight after work.  Super delicious. A bookmarked knocked off!!!"
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,19-Apr-17,"it's late, and you're hungry. No Jack in the Crack or Taco Hell here just honest, good Indian food.  Garlic naan- fluffy, hot, and full of flavor.   Chicken Tandoori- It's packing heat so be warned, but it's addicting.   Pulled tea- my favorite drink in Singapore! It's aerated, light, deliciously sweet. It's the perfect thing to balance out the heat from the chicken.   Staff here is no nonsense and curt. You can't go wrong here if you're looking for a quick, cheap eat."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,5,19-Jul-14,"So, we were just exploring Little India and I happened to see a little sign for naan. I figured, why not try it out? So, my boo ordered some of that as well as some tandoori chicken. It was SOOOOOO goood!!!!!!!! I was eating it UP!!! haha. SO, we ordered some MORE naan as well as some tikka chicken this time!! It was tasty yet again though I do have a personal preference for the tandoori!  Btw, you just order and take a seat anywhere, then keep ordering and pay at the counter when you're about to leave. Don't worry, they are all staring at you like hawks and know your order. As we were paying, I noticed they also had CHEESE naan so of course we got that to go. It was YUMMY as well :P"
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,3,15-Oct-19,"I was expecting something great...but i was disappointed. Ordered chili chicken, bryani rice, butter naan and tandori chicken. The chili chicken lacked flavor, there was no spice what so ever. It was very mild and taste less. As for the bryani, i should have know better i hate cilantro and of course that is all i could taste. The tandoori chicken was dry and hard to finish..but the naan was GREAT..."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,31-Jul-17,"Looking for delicious Indian in Singapore!  Staff here is no nonsense and curt. You can't go wrong here if you're looking for a quick, cheap eat.  Garlic naan- fluffy, hot, and full of flavor.  Chicken Tandoori- It's packing heat so be warned, but it's addicting.  Pulled tea- my favorite drink in Singapore! It's aerated, light, deliciously sweet. It's the perfect thing to balance out the heat from the chicken.  It was a satisfying experience. I would put this one on the records of good eating!"
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,3,11-Jan-17,"Efficiency be darned! The pace here is alarmingly slow. Hungry bellies wait for no one.  The food at Usman is okay. Dining on spicy Indian food is not optimal when there is no AC. Sweating like a farm animal while trying to avoid seasoning my own food with my bodily excretions doesn't really do it for me. It is the 21st century after all.  Perhaps take out from here is a is a better option than dining in.  Regardless of my observations, the restaurant packs it in and rarely experiences a lull."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,6-Oct-16,"This spot offers both meat and vegetarian items. The naan is made to order and particularly delicious - I wish we had ordered the garlic cheese one as both garlic and cheese (separately) were excellent. The mango lassi was exceptional.  Cash only, so come prepared for that. Prices seemed a little high by Little India standards. (Main courses were around $11) There's a small sink you can use to wash your hands before/after the meal - its to the left of the food display."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,5,22-Mar-17,"Late night, hungry. Usman just outside my door. Hole-in-the-wall joint with NO pretense about fancy d¨¦cor. Great food!!!!! Garlic cheese naan (that's right... no need to choose - get both!), butter chicken, mango lassie. Immediate service, quick turn-around for food delivery, and the owner checked us out at the end. Little to no dent in the wallet. Tomorrow night?"
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,19-Apr-15,"Warning: 1. Come here if you like to eat with your hands. They don't like to let you use their cutlery. 2. If you sit outside, the stench from the drain may overpower the taste of your food  Ok, so this grotty joint isn't the cleanest or the cutest place. It's on the corner of the notorious Desker road in little India. You'll get ambience alright. It's really quite a hoot sitting there and seeing/smelling the real world of Little India. Until your food arrives that is.  You'll be blown away by the fluffy naans. Butter, garlic, or garlic and cheese or sesame naan, so many choices, too few carb calories to have.  Then there is the palak paneer. Massive fan. Their version is dark green almost black. But omg with the cheese naan, you'll be having the most satisfying dinner/ supper yet. Washed down with a masala chai, you would then wonder why you haven't been here before.  Simply good. I recommend taking a nap after a meal here. Bliss!"
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,2-Dec-15,4 stars instead of 5 due to the ambience. Server is attentive and courteous too. Food is excellent and served hot. Server recommended Dhall fry which is delicious. Waiting time is short too. Seen all patrons are satisfied with the food and servings portion is just nice too. Will definitely come back with friends.
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,5,26-Aug-15,"One of the best authentic Indian food to have in Singapore. The ambience and cleanliness would definitely be a put off for almost everyone; however, if you are able to resist then you are up for blissful Indian food.  Things to try: 1. Dal tadka 2. Butter Chicken 3. Palak Paneer 4. Garlic Naan"
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,6-Apr-18,"Came here with a couple of friends and got a plethora of food to share family style. Highlights were the daal, aloo gobi, chicken karahi, and samosas. Everything had the right amount of spice. The bread we ordered with the meal was alright - garlic and cheese naan. The seekh kebab and palak chicken were disappointing. Service was quick and attentive. I would come again if I were in Singapore again."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,4-Jun-18,"Fabulous, rustic, Indian food, That I stumbled upon by accident when I was lost and hungry while exploring the city. I would defiantly recommend this place for a taste of India."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,22-Jan-18,"Excellent Indian food, the garlic naan bread was delicious and it went well with the chicken masala. The tandoori chicken was tasty. I really enjoyed the mango lassi drink. This is a cash only restaurant, I had to find an ATM before eating here."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,30-Jul-15,"As everyone has said, they have one of the best naan in Singapore. Their Palak Paneer (made to order) is not creamy at all but very well made. The chickpea is like the one that you get in an authentic Indian or Pakistani dhaba.  The best dish is the karahi chicken which is only made to order and takes close to 20 minutes as its prepared from scratch for every order. A must if you have the time or can do a take away as well.  Should try their special chicken fried rice which is very flavourful with large amount of chicken, sauted onions, tomatoes and green chillies.  Didn't bother trying any drinks as there is nothing out of the ordinary and are normal items."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,7-Jun-15,"I wish I would've found this place much earlier. Their food is definitely something to write home about. There is no AC, credit card machine, dressed-up waiters/kitchen staff, just great desi food.  I got the lahori tandoor with a garlic naan (Total: $6). The chicken was mildly spiced and the garlic naan was hot and fresh. Finding seating may be difficult at times since this place is so popular with locals and the number of seats are limited by the outside space.  FYI....be prepared to eat with your hands and wash them afterwards. This is how this type of food is meant to be eaten so don't complain about lack of utensils to the staff."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,10-Dec-14,"It is without a doubt that the naans here are great. I had the butter naan and at first glance, I was skeptical as I could see the naan dripping with the liquified butter. Not something I would order if I knew it was so high in the cholesterol. When I tore the naan apart, it peeled easily. The texture was soft in the inside but mildly crispy on the outside and it was actually much better than it looked. Even when consuming it without the curry.  I also had the chicken masala to go with the naan. This curry was sweet and not spicy. The chicken in it fell off easily from the bone, which is exactly the way I like my meat - stewed for a long time and soft and light on the palette. The curry could have been a little spicier to give it a kick.  The teh tarik here is just average and we ordered siu dai to preempt an often too generous dosage of the white matter from the drinks maker. I had a coffee to go too. First time having Indian coffee and I can only say that Indian coffee isn't something I'll ever order again.  This place is cheap! You can get all the North Indian food you want - masala, chicken, mutton, naan (all types), fish, whatever here at an affordable price though I hope I haven't spoken too soon less they raise prices. Moderately crowded, all the seats were occupied at 8pm on a weekday night. Will definitely come back to try the other stuff!"
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,5,31-Oct-15,"I've been treated to a lot of Indian places at home in Australia, but never have I tasted such amazing flavours.  Usman's concerned me when I first encountered it: open air on a day when the haze was thick. None the less, my wife and I proceeded to order.  Thank goodness we did. Truly excellent food and the best Naan I have ever tasted.  We tried the tandoori chicken biryani, a chicken curry starting with a k (the name escapes me right now), mutter paneer and a couple of mango lasis.  I highly recommend it, definitely worth the trip to Little India."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,11-May-19,"While visiting Singapore, I stayed at a hotel within walking distance from Usmans. I was in town for 3 nights, and I ended up getting food from usmans all 3 nights. Most of the time, it was a late night meal, as they are one of the few places in the area that are open late. Loved the ambiance of this restaurant. Open air, good aroma, diverse people all coming together for good food. Reminded me of the times I've visited Pakistan. However, I do have mixed reviews on the food. The Haleem was to die for! Amazing taste, perfect amount of spice, and pairs perfectly with their fresh naan. I also tried their Nahari. It was okay, but you can tell it was previously frozen, taken out and heated. It was actually still cold when I had it. The tandori chicken and kabobs were good, but they were pretty standard. I have had better. Overall, I enjoyed Usmans for the atmosphere and the food, but there is certainly room for improvement."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,5,9-Jul-12,"This is my go-to place for ""north Indian and Pakistani"" food. (That's what they call themselves, despite the political connotations!)  Geopolitics aside, this is THE place in Singapore to go to if you want fluffy, hot naans. Delicious, and always fresh off the tandoor -- always. They take their leavened breads very seriously. I've been coming here for years and I've never had a cold, stale one. Or one that wasn't delicious.  It occupies an entire kopitiam unit at the junction of Serangoon and Desker Roads, so it's bustling, all the time. The staff are efficient, personable and funny; the drinks a touch too sweet, as any north Indian/Pakistani place would be.  No night time adventure to nearby Mustafa Centre is complete without cheese naan, chicken kadai, dal fry, pepper fish, haleem and nihari (the latter two sell out early!). It's not quite restaurant-standard clean, but the food is; the surroundings may not be. But sometimes I think sitting in the back alley beside Usman, devouring desi khana, is my quintessential Singapore experience. Especially since they don't make this any better elsewhere in this country except in a private home."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,3,17-Sep-17,"The food is good. It seems like originally Indian food. The restaurant had not a air conditioner, so hot."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,1,24-Jun-19,"If it could be less than 1 star that is what I would give. Server claims food to be fresh but everything is microwaved. The entrees that came out had the microwave toughness in the meat. You are literally eating on the street, no bathroom and customer service is non existent."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,1,3-Jun-17,Badgered into buying supposedly freshly cooked paneer dishes which along with garlic naan was very average especially for the price. Topped off by being served a warm drink after ordering a cold drink with ice.
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,3,11-Sep-16,"The cheese naan is phenomenal. The mattar paneer was kinda lame, paneer was tough n flavorless. Felt overpriced at $9 or $10 for a small dish. Masala tea was ok, not very spicy n blander than I'd expect for an Indian place. The neighboring table got some kind of steaming vegetables that smelled awesome. I would definitely come back for the naan, and want to try their cardamom lassi."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,27-May-17,"I had few meals here with different dishes, must try will be Keema fry and Channa fry with their hot Naan's. Let the order taker know if you would like to have extra spicy. Enjoy"
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,5,23-Sep-16,I read that this place had the best cheese naan in Singapore so I decided to give it a try and..... this place..... was..... amazing!!! the food was great but the naan they make here is exceptional. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed. I had too much food and couldn't try the briyani but naan and tandoori chicken was still great!
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,5,17-Nov-15,"Sorry this ain't the place to go to on your first date. It's a Hole-in-the-wall located in middle of the chaos that fills Little India, but if you're looking for authentic Indo-Pakistani cuisine that'll leave a taste in you mouth well past dinner time this is the place to go to. I've tried them all in Singapore and this is the undisputed king of kings. Packed to the gills at all hours...even past midnight into the wee hours of the morning. I think they close at 3am.  Signature dishes - Nihari and the Half Kadhai...I know these guys so well when I go, the urgency is to find a seat. And then all I do is make eye contact with Javed bhaijaan and he knows what I want."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,9-Jul-16,This is an amazing place for a quick lunch if you feel like real indian taste. The Naan is out of this world. Service is pretty good too
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,4,10-Mar-16,"When you see Indian people eating at a restaurant in little India, you know it can't go wrong. I ordered a dish that I can't remember the name but it was quite too spicy for me (it's a dish that had to be cooked individually and not in the already made that you can order). I kept eating anyways despite my tongue was burning more and more after each bite. But the best part of it was the cheese and garlic naan. Hands down or thumbs up or however you want to call it, best naan I've had...for now anyways until I visit India in the future."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,5,11-Nov-17,"First stop when we got into the city. They were open late which was a plus. After 26 hours flying, this hit the spot. We got a mixed platter of chicken tikka and kababs. Food and service was great. Price point was very reasonable."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,5,2-Jul-16,"Cheap delicious eats. What more can you ask for? Forget the places that try to fancy it up. Indian food, by definition, is peasant food and that's a good thing. This joint hits the spot."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,3,19-May-18,"Tried mutton briyani. Mutton was very tender and spicy good. Had aloo gobi too. First time at this place and was there early, off peak dinner time so was not super crowded. I expect crowd will build up later. Back to the food. I though I had better briyani but mutton was tasty and well cook. Go with more people so you can try more items on the menu."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,5,14-Mar-15,one of the best naan in town! Opens till late! Try the variety of naan that is soft and delicious. dont forget to add on the butter chicken or keema!
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,5,1-Feb-15,"My husband and I love this place! The nihari is perfection, the chicken biryani is delicious, and the seekh kebab are amazing. We took a few of our friends there last night and not only was it easy for our group but we were served quickly and on time! We always come back here and definitely won't stop!"
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,3,30-Aug-15,"Quite affordable place. Food is ok not that great. But the serving is really really slow. Visit this place on weekends, if you have lot of time."
Usman Restaurant,3.9,39,Indian,1,7-Jul-17,"Pakistani Restaurant, posing to be indian.... typical super oily pakistani food, with strange smells... NO THANKS"
Caffe Fernet,4.5,4,"Italian, Cocktail Bars",5,7-Jan-20,"I love it here! The staff is great and very accommodating. I love the view and really enjoy the opened restaurant concept.  They have a really nice happy hour and it can get quite busy during the week.  We had a large party of about 10 or so and they were on point with timing of the meals and the portion sizes were good as well. The staff even asked if there were any dietary restrictions, which was very much appreciated.  We had so much, I can't even remember everything and some of the entrees are no longer being served as the menu changes.  VEAL MEATBALLS san marzano tomato, ricotta, basil 21- very filling, easily one is plenty!  MARINATED CALAMARI sun-dried tomato, fennel pollen 17- you can never go wrong with Calamari, cooked perfectly!  AHI TUNA TARTARE calabrian chilli, green onion, sesame 21- light and full of flavor!"
Caffe Fernet,4.5,4,"Italian, Cocktail Bars",4,24-Sep-20,"My second time visiting caffe fernet, this time for dinner. We were seated in a far back corner which wasn't too bad since there was a fan and even though it wasn't at the water edge we still had a pretty good view of the bay and MBS.  We ordered cacio e Pepe ($26), pompano piccata ($42), and burrata ($24). For drinks a friend and I shared the watermelon frose pitcher ($68). My favourite was the burrata with green tomatoes and lime. The tomatoes were kind of spicy and were sort of like tomatillos, went really well with the creamy burrata. The piccata isn't something I would usually order but it was very good as well, the skin was crispy and I loved the trout caviar on top.  Service wise- we didn't have the best experience. Understand that they were very busy and I think it might have partly been because our table was tucked in the corner but we were trying to flag down someone for more than 10 minutes with no success. Eventually my friend had to get up to get someone to wait on our table. They were very apologetic though and gave us a free dessert (honey cake) to compensate which we were very grateful for"
Caffe Fernet,4.5,4,"Italian, Cocktail Bars",4,16-Oct-19,"Great view and great service! The lunch set is a bit pricey; but if you think you're paying for the amazing view of marina bay sands, then it's worth it!"
Caffe Fernet,4.5,4,"Italian, Cocktail Bars",5,24-Jun-18,"This is another place that had been on my list to hit! I was craving pasta on a Friday evening and made my way down to the waterfront. As soon as I walked in, the ambiance was really nice. I had a wine slushy (!) first because I was so hot and then ordered a glass of red wine from the Happy Hour menu. The bartender recommended the homemade sausage and smoked ricotta pasta (something alone those lines) and it was nice and savory and salty, which is what I wanted. I And, the views were pretty sweet! I look forward to trying more goodies from here!"
Catch,4.3,4,Fish & Chips,4,17-Aug-17,Nice location right in the midst of a very popular night spot. Good food (had the Halibut version of the fish and chips) and a wide selection of beers (unless you order the 4 liter tower which only has 2 options). Better have help for it unless you're real thirsty. Fortunately had 3 colleagues helping.
Catch,4.3,4,Fish & Chips,4,6-Nov-17,"Great little spot by the river in Clark Quay. Despite the tourist location, it was awesome. The halibut fish and chips were nearly perfect. And surprise: one of the best margaritas I've had. I'll definitely be back!"
Catch,4.3,4,Fish & Chips,4,8-Aug-15,"Wandering through Clarke Quay after some time away always means looking out for what has closed and what has opened. The only thing that is constant here is that eateries, bars and cafes always change. On a Saturday evening we stumbled across Catch, a small restaurant in the middle of Clarke Quay directly across from the Highlander and the Pump Room. Seating is mostly outside with just a couple of tables inside. The menu is simple with Fish and Chips being the main feature although there are some other alternatives to the fish.  We ordered a Dory and Chips and a Halibut and Chips. Drinks were a bottle of craft cider from the UK, (cannot remember the name) and a pint of their draft Catch ale. Service was very friendly and prompt with the drinks coming out fast followed by the food. After seeing the food quality go downhill at one of the premium fish and chip restaurants over at Bukit Timah, we were eager to find an alternative source of our much loved Fish and Chips. We need not have worried. The chips were not so traditional, but similar to the French fries in many restaurants everywhere. Lightly spiced, and well cooked. The fish which was cooked in English Beer Batter (you do get a choice of this or Japanese breadcrumbs or spicy) was nicely served and cooked very well with the right amount of crispiness. Fish was very nicely cooked with the halibut having the edge in terms of flavor over the dory. Cod was also on the menu.  It has only been open a couple of months, but we will be back for sure and if they maintain the quality, it should be a big success."
Catch,4.3,4,Fish & Chips,5,3-Aug-16,Amazing salmon fish and chips. Service was really quick. Decent selection of beer. Hope to be back.
Su Korean BBQ,4.5,2,"Korean, Barbeque",4,24-Apr-17,"A great place to dine and catch up over lunch or dinner. While most kbbq places promise quantity, su promise quality food served in just nice portions that leave you neither too full not too hungry. Their side dishes are rather authentic and surely a steal as provided free flow with any meal ordered. Their lunch specials are especially worth it with a main (choice of bimbimbap, hot plates, ramen etc), the free flow side dishes and a drink for $10++! Definitely worth a try"
Su Korean BBQ,4.5,2,"Korean, Barbeque",5,1-Jan-17,"Excellent restaurant for group gatherings over quality Korean BBQ! Generous with side dishes, well seasoned BBQ meats and wide selection of ala carte, lunch/dinner set menus and BBQ sets! Albert, who runs the place, is also very friendly and chats with every customer that comes in. We ordered the promotion BBQ set menu for 3 pax at only $68.80! Super value for money as it was amazing! Look forward to coming back again!"
Mangiamo Pizzeria,4.3,3,"Italian, Pizza",4,18-Jul-16,"I think there are more food to enjoy in this place, I visited it once this week and I will be coming back to taste more of the food they are serving. Had wine and pizza, for tourists this is the place to have that wine before bed time or after shopping around the area. Near Little India, Sim Lim SQ., La Salle."
Mangiamo Pizzeria,4.3,3,"Italian, Pizza",5,20-Nov-16,"This place is my top find of the last few months. The fact that it's in Albert Court (one of my favorite corners of the city but a place that can't seem to keep a decent restaurant open) makes it all the better. The six or seven dishes I've tried here have all been very good and the price is reasonable. Pizzas, steak, grilled chicken breast, and chef salad are all simple but delicious. The chef and managers' shy but friendly service, the adorable plaid plastic table cloths, and the reliably good house wine at 6$ a glass all make Mangiamo a sure bet."
Mangiamo Pizzeria,4.3,3,"Italian, Pizza",4,4-May-18,A fine spot for vegetarians who want some respite from the usual SE Asia fare. Lots of non-meat options.
Mrs Pho House Rangoon,4.4,7,Vietnamese,5,9-Apr-23,"I ordered the Mrs. Ph? dry noodle (b¨²n) with pork and meatballs and fried spring roll. Let's cut to the chase...  When I first saw the bowl of B¨²n as it was set down on the table, I thought I'd be disappointed with it. It looked different. But what happened next was a culinary lesson in prejudice; don't judge by looks alone. After taking the first bite I realized that this was probably going to be really good. And each subsequent bite just confirmed that realization.  Although the combination of ingredients was a little different than other b¨²n I've had (this one had hardly any mint, and few bean sprouts), it was one of the best that I've had.  I highly recommend this place. It's the real deal as far as crafting the right flavors."
Mrs Pho House Rangoon,4.4,7,Vietnamese,4,19-Sep-18,"I regularly go to Mrs Pho on Beach Road so it was a nice surprise to see this new one on Rangoon Road! I really enjoy the noodles at Mrs Pho and I felt that Mrs Pho House was better with dishes than the noodles. I ordered the exact same crab noodles at Mrs Pho House and it was not as good as what I had at their Beach Road location.  On the other hand though, Mrs Pho House is much more comfortable - the seats are not as cramped up and there's more room for everyone. They also offer a wider variety of dishes like Banh Xeo and Banh Khot, alongside claypot and stir-fried items.  I really enjoyed their stir-fried dishes, I thought they were all very well executed. The Banh Xeo was good but not crisp enough. I liked the Banh Khot and would definitely order them again! The next time I'm there, I would love to try their claypot dishes since those crab noodles look amazing!"
Mrs Pho House Rangoon,4.4,7,Vietnamese,5,4-Dec-17,"Update Banh Canh Cua - 2.5 stars Didn't taste like crab and had few ingredients. Sticking to the other dishes!  ==========  Lemongrass beef noodle dry ($9.90) - 5 stars I haven't had good Vietnamese food since leaving L.A. until Mrs Pho! It's also very reasonably priced. The flavors were excellent - the beef was juicy, flavorful and grilled to perfection. Although I got takeout and regretted not adding more of the hot sauce on the table.  I'm going back for sure!!! They also have Banh Canh Cua, or crab meat noodle, which I haven't seen outside of Hanoi."

Mrs Pho House Rangoon,4.4,7,Vietnamese,5,9-Jun-18,This is probably the authentic Vietnam food in singapore. We love the cocker dish which the way the cook so yummy. My son and I ate non stop. Highly recommend to Singaporean and Vietnamese as well The staffs are very helpful and friendly
Mrs Pho House Rangoon,4.4,7,Vietnamese,5,7-May-17,"Been here twice. Wonderful Vietnamese food. The dry noodles and Pho were excellent so were the starfruit beef salad and the omelette salad. The Vietnam Coffee were very good, hot or cold. Will definitely return."
Mrs Pho House Rangoon,4.4,7,Vietnamese,5,3-Aug-18,"It's hard to find a good Vietnamese restaurant around the city center unless you head to Geylang. But Mrs. Pho is one of the few places that I would highly recommend. Being Vietnamese, I crave Vietnamese food everyday. I have been to Mrs. Pho numerous times and have not been disappointed. Their Pho is delicious, with the right portion size. The broth is slightly sweet, which is perfect! They also have B¨²n B Hu, which is also quite good. It has the right amount of spiciness and most of the key ingredients of the soup. It's one of my favorite soup to order here. Their B¨¢nh X¨¨o is also good. I don't have to go the any fancy place at Orchard for this. The crepe is nice and crispy and the flavor is delightful. Although they don't provide enough mint and herbs. Again, I highly recommend this place for Vietnamese food!"
Mrs Pho House Rangoon,4.4,7,Vietnamese,2,25-Nov-18,"Mediocre - Not great. The papaya salad had a fishy taste as if the prawns were old; the fried rice was too salty; the pho had a weak, watery broth. I've been to Vietnam 20+ times and I didn't find this food very authentic, at all. There are far too many restaurants that serve this kind of so-so mediocre food, what I call ""tourist food"". Bland, low quality food that isn't terrible but not great, either."
Tian Tian Seafood Restaurant,4.7,3,"Seafood, Chinese",5,28-Jul-23,Fantastic experience. The chilli crab was the best I ever ate. The lemon chicken was just right. The lemony sweetness was amazing. The broccoli in oyster sauce was very well prepared. The staff was friendly and patient. The service was prompt. You have to pay for water so bring your own water bottle.
Tian Tian Seafood Restaurant,4.7,3,"Seafood, Chinese",5,8-May-16,"One of the most reasonable priced seafood restaurant that I have gone to. I always come here when I have a gathering with family and friends for special occasion. To start off, order the Drunken herbal prawns which comes in a claypot and its swimming in a herbal soup that taste just right amount of herbal infusion (wolf berries included). Just thinking of it making me hungry again... Next, Yong Chow fried rice (fried with shrimps & chopped up char Siew)...& small deep fried squid in dark sweet sauce (very crispy) super yummy. Now comes the mains, like chilli crab & side order of man tao. The chilli is done just the right spiciness & sweetness too, and the Man Tao to dip into it is wonderful. Oh yes, throw in a plate of Sambal Kang Kong for some fiber in your diet. Most of the dishes comes in S/M/L plate size depending on the number of pax or how hungry you are! They have other seafood choices too like frog legs, Geoduck, fresh fish, clams.... Bon Apertit."
Tian Tian Seafood Restaurant,4.7,3,"Seafood, Chinese",4,24-Aug-16,Awesome happy hour under the tent during the afternoon rain with a $9 pitcher of beer and some snacks. Dinner was great but I really wish they would figure out how to give the true Chinese menu experience to one or 2 people. Portion sizes are for sharing and it is very difficult to have dinner for one. Still extremely fresh and delicious.
Eggslut,3.4,5,"Sandwiches, Breakfast & Brunch",4,19-May-24,"It's not a bad choice for breakfast.   Got the bacon egg and cheese sandwiche, hashbrowns, and a white coffee.  The sandwich was good, they are not greedy with the bacon (which is great).  The yoke in the sandwich is runny, so if that isn't your thing, say something.   The hashbrowns were the best part, a little greasy.  The coffee was average.   But this place is a solid choice for breakfast."
Eggslut,3.4,5,"Sandwiches, Breakfast & Brunch",3,9-Mar-23,"My friend and I passed by the nice-looking eatery in a glass building and decided to try it out. Initially it was not clear whether we had to order or find a table first (it's the latter). I had the sandwich with egg, cheese and bacon plus truffle hashbrowns. You must be cautious when eating the egg as the yolk will ooze out and may get wasted. Overall satisfying and the hashbrowns were one of the tastier hashbrowns I have ever had but the food is a tad overpriced and came warm instead of hot. Still worth a try."
Eggslut,3.4,5,"Sandwiches, Breakfast & Brunch",4,16-May-23,the double cheese burger is amazing but maybe too much oil  the eggslut is really not my taste  a little expensive but worth a shot
Eggslut,3.4,5,"Sandwiches, Breakfast & Brunch",3,24-Sep-22,"Planned to go here with a friend that was craving this from when they were in Cali.  I tried the Fairfax sandwich and had the duck fat fried truffle hash browns on the side.  Light, fluffy and creamy egg mixture sandwiched in-between two brioche buns. Sounds great right? It is if you aren't too picky about your brioche. The brioche was quite stiff and not fluffy like how I usually enjoy brioche so minus a star on that. More on the inside: The best part were the caramelised onions and they synergised well with the sriracha mayo which conjured a spicy sambal flavour profile.  The hash browns were quite typical(hence why they weren't photographed) and I have had much better duck fat fries before so this was just ok. The truffle aroma is very subtle and almost didn't catch it.  All things considered I use a 10 point scale and I don't really measure service, ambience etc. Just food.  So... for my first review on this app Eggslut 7/10"
Eggslut,3.4,5,"Sandwiches, Breakfast & Brunch",3,17-Jan-22,"Flavor: 4.5/5 Price: 3/5 Ambiance: 3.5/5 Wait time: 2/5 Location: fairly central but depends on whether you like braving the orchard crowd  Is it worth the hype? Flavor wise yes, I was actually pleasantly surprised, but I doubt anyone would come back after getting it once :) Oh pass on the roast beef sandwich, it was a disappointment.  A 45-60min wait for $12 egg sandwiches... you have better things to do. Plus your arteries will thank you."
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,5,30-Mar-16,"Great affordable Thai food, one of my favorite solid places. While there're so many new Thai places that sprout up around the city, I love being able to head to a reliable place like this & know I'll have a tasty meal always! Especially as I love actual spicy Thai food with bite.  The lunch sets are solid and come with drinks like lime juice. My favorites are tom yum soup noodles, beef noodles soup (very fragrant soup), pineapple rice set which comes with green curry and pandan chicken and a few other sides, green curry. The basil chicken is popular & it uses actual chili padi & packs a punch!This place also gives me the feels because it's a very popular RI/RJ haunt, and I've come countless times with different groups of friends. It's a very casual feel with no frills decor, but always clean.  I also frequently visited the purvis street location last summer as it was close to my internship, and discovered other great dishes like mango sticky rice, papaya salad, omelette, pandan chicken and so on. Never disappoints!"
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,1,28-Jun-19,Eat here just because we need to get something from Premimpin. Location parking - bad. If you don't pay attention bound to get fine. Ambience - aircon. Service - good. ordering - tablet nice! Food - ok. Nothing to purposely come for. Value - ok. I would still put Nakhon ahead - sorry. Finished off too fast. Red or i say pink Ruby was over salt. tapioca with extremely diluted syrup.
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,5,28-Oct-14,"Nicely located within my parents neighborhood, I've seen this Thai eatery grow from here since its humble beginnings to a brand name with other outlets across the island. They have maintained the same menu and budget prices that have helped then build a loyal following.  Almost everything on their menu is value for money. Whether you're eating solo or treating your family, you feel you've got your money's worth. That's why the only accept cash.  I've eaten their awesome beef noodles since they opened shop and it tastes the same today as it did the day they opened. Same robust recipe that build them a reputation. And it still costs $5. For the robust flavor and chunks of beef brisket you get, this is good food at a great price.  Come early or call to make a reservation. Otherwise you'll have to wait, especially on weekends. Take note of their opening hours because they only open for lunch and then they close until opening for dinner again. They take those rest hours for rest and prep time before their dinner crowd.  Weekdays 11am-3pm, then 6pm-9pm Weekends 11am-3pm then 6pm-10pm  Tel: 62580228"
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,4,5-Oct-12,"Amazing prices for great Thai food. The food is affordable enough for me to spot a few tables of students from a nearby school.  I was here for a late lunch and thankfully it wasn't crowded at all. The set lunches are great value, you get a drink (lime juice/etc) and a dessert (tapioca! yeah!) in addition to your main course.  The thai beef noodles were really good if you are in the mood for something light and soupy. The broth is sweet and flavorful and not too oily. And the noodles is actually the thin rice noodles, the kind they use in pad thai. Very good.  The pad thai is sweet, as in most pad thai. Not the best I've had but definitely better than average. The shrimps that comes with it were large and succulent and very fresh.  Pandan chicken is a great side dish. Only $2 per piece, and it is not chicken breast! woohoo!  Great little find in a otherwise-filled-with-factory-canteen neighborhood. Plus free parking if you can find a spot around the area."
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,4,3-Aug-19,"Went to Jln Pemimpin to duplicate my car key, made a wrong turn and saw this nice little Thai eatery. Food is nice but the waitresses need to be more attentive."
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,4,23-Mar-16,"Have been a regular fan here! I visit this place mostly on Sundays. The restaurant is tucked in a really quiet neighborhood but I drive, so its easy for me :D Parking isn't too hard to find given if the residents are giving people. There's always a crowd for sunday evenings, even for an area like clover way.  The food is great, all of it. And the price is too! Only thing that i found expensive were the drinks. Thai milk tea at $2.50, not so cheap. The restaurant floor is run by just 2 guys whom will seat you down, take orders and serve them. Just 2 only but no complains, service is decent and efficient if i might say.  Only accepts cash payment only. So always check your wallet before ordering away on those irresistible yummies!"
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,4,18-Feb-15,"We finally found the time to search for Jai Thai since moving into the neighborhood recently. On Google maps it looks like there should be a short cut rather than having to get to Junction 8 first and ""hiking"" into the little enclave of Clover Way. Anyway, enough of the Bear Grylls stuff, Jai Thai is situated in a nondescript row of modern shophouses book ended by two coffee shops.  It's nothing fancy inside, brightly lit with cheaper furniture, but this place isn't about the decor, it's about the food. You shutdown with a menu, pencil and paper and order from the large two sided menu. When ordering from a Thai restaurant for the first time, my theory is that you have to order Tom Yum seafood soup and Green Curry Chicken in order to do a true comparison. This we did accompanied by beansprouts stir fried with salted fish and chicken with holy basil. For drinks we ordered a Thai Chendol and a Thai iced tea.  Service was swift and we settled in for a great meal. The Tom Yum did not have the coloring you see in many restaurants, but was very spicy. The seafood consisted of Octopus, fried fish and prawns, and the ratio of seafood to soup was very generous. Did I mention it was spicy? The green curry was delicious. Thick, creamy with a flavor of coconut and very spicy also. Generous chunks of chicken with this vegetables I never remember the name of, but you only see in a Thai green curry. The bean sprouts were crunchy and flavorful, and while unable to vouch for the holiness of the basil, the chicken with holy basil was a delightfully spicy dish.  For sure, all dishes were spicy, but hey, it's a Thai restaurant right? It was also easy to avoid the devilish little chili padi if you wanted to.  The drinks were enough to cool down any mouths on fire.  Prices were very reasonable and we will certainly be returning. Now if only we could find that short cut."
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,5,18-Dec-14,"I'm from Thailand and Jai Thai is one of the three regular places I visit regularly. That should say a bit about the food there :)  Because it's not as easily accessible (although near enough to walk from Marymount), the queues here are not crazily long as Nakorn's. That said, don't expect it to be empty. I have been there all sorts of time and never once see it empty.  The food is affordable and helps me miss home a bit less. I'm tempted to say that everything is nice here, but that won't be too helpful. My usual orders here include: fried fish dish with thai sauce, chicken and basil leaves, and Thai iced tea."
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,5,12-Feb-16,Really authentic and affordable Thai food! The friendly and efficient service is another bonus.
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,4,16-Feb-13,"I'm trying to think of reasons why I shouldn't give Jai Thai 5 stars... and there are only three I can think of: First, that they don't serve alcohol. How great would a beer be with that spicy green mango salad? Oh, and second: if Jai Thai delivered, I would positively be in HEAVEN. Thirdly: Jai Thai is cash only. Booooo for those nights I haven't had time to stop at the ATM on the way home from work. So, really, Jai Thai is nearrrrrly at 5 stars for me, but what they do have is crazy good.  It's true what's been said before -- the value for money here is second to none. The sign outside their door is correct: Wallet Friendly Authentic Thai Cuisine. I've spent a lot of time in Thailand -- this is the real deal, yo.  They have plenty of dishes for diets of all kinds, including vegetarians, and so far everything I've tried has been teh awsum. My current favorites are the broccoli with prawn, the aforementioned green mango salad, any/all of the squid dishes, and HELLZ YAH TO THE FISH CAKES. The prawn cakes are good too, but the fish cakes are wayyyyyyy mo bettah. You will be so missing out if you don't order these, trust me trust me trust me.  They have several set menus which are also great value, particularly for lunch or for larger parties. Thai iced tea is sweet and plentiful, and service is swift and friendly. What's not to love? Erhm, maybe the industrial fluorescent lighting is a bit... difficult. They don't get points for atmosphere. But you'll be so involved in what you're eating that I doubt it'll stop you from returning..."
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,4,26-Aug-12,"I had heard that this is a very value for money place to visit for good Thai food, and decided to make a visit together with my friends. Unfortunately, we forgot to make a reservation ahead of time, and had to wait for quite a while in a queue before we were able to get in. Once we got in, we also had quite a long wait for the food, but I guess that can't be helped given the popularity of this place. But anyway, let's talk about the food. We had the deep fried seabass with pepper & garlic, which was really fresh and very well cooked with the crispy skin and succulent flesh. Given the relatively cheap price of this, we were very impressed with the quality. Another notable dish that we had was the tom yum soup with prawns, which was also fantastic. The tom yum soup was not excessively spicy, and the seafood found within was really fresh. Overall, this is definitely a must-visit place if you're on the prowl for affordable and delicious Thai food."
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,4,10-Jul-12,"Jai Thai is the sort of place you would probably NEVER get a seat at if it was downtown. Luckily, it's in a quiet neighbourhood. Even then it's pretty hard to get a seat already.  It's a very cheap, down-to-earth, authentically Thai place. The sort of place where everything is good! Aroy maak."
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,2,13-Nov-16,"The food was ok, not worth the very very far walk into the ulu location. The paht Thai and fried tang hoon is too sweet and sour for my liking. Nothing special about the tom yam soup. The only plus point is there is no queue and the food is served swiftly. Personally, I rather queue in nakorn rather then eating here. Don't waste your time if you don't have a car."
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,4,22-Jan-18,Love this thai place mainly because it's just a few minutes walk from my place. My go to lazy sunday dinner if we're lazy to think of what to eat. Really friendly staff too.
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,4,16-Jul-12,"My go-to Thai restaurant as it is conveniently located just a few minutes' drive away! I always order the ultra-worth-it pineapple rice set with small servings of green chicken curry, leaf-wrapped fried chicken and fried fish with sweet chilli sauce. Yums. The set also comes with a drink and a dessert (albeit in tiny portions), all for less than eight dollars. I sometimes order the Beef Noodle which is pretty decent too. Service here is not the best, especially during peak hours, but not bad enough to turn a loyal customer like me away!"
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,1,4-Feb-18,what used to be a gem that offered affordable food is now just a run-of-the-mill hiked in prices but not in quality. more misses than hits!
Jai Thai,3.8,17,Thai,4,29-Aug-12,"For delicious Thai food that is good and affordable, look no further than the Clover district. I lived in the area for 2 years, but it was not till my friend told me about it that I actually walked over. They have a green curry set and beef noodle set for less than 7 dollars, and it comes with a drink as well as a dessert (usually konniyaku jelly). The olive rice sets/rice sets come with portions of chicken/green curry and more - so if you intend to try their specialties, go for it as you can try a bit of everything in bite sized protions - the best thing is that is less than 10 dollars. Do also try the Thai iced tea that comes with crushed ice and the milk tea is not too sweet - it is slightly more orange than normal iced teas though and it's an interesting blend. The ruby chendol - is also really delicious and the red bits are slightly crunch + juicy - it is a great mixed with the coconut milk."
Tai Liok Claypot Chicken Rice,5,1,"Street Vendors, Chinese",5,23-Jan-19,My favorite dish so far in the Alexandra Food Centre is Tai Liok Claypot Chicken Rice from stall #01-68  The flavors are great.
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",4,20-Jan-17,"Came here for a beer and some live music. The vibe on a Friday night was lively and many young people were out. Crowd was more international. Service was good. The live music that night was inconsistent- some songs were excellent, some were crucified. We were lucky to get an outdoor seat. If you want one of the few coveted seats outside, come early. This place is located at the end of the street. I would come back."
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",3,28-Jan-20,"I'm on a fence if I should thumbs up this place or not. The ambiance is retro and ethnic, it feels like a snug fit in a Himalayan village in terms of both space and decor. The service was slow, but the dogs were adorable. The drinks weren't great, but the curry pasta was innovative. The price is high for a full meal; maybe just drinks and the late night music that I've only heard about and didn't stay for is a better choice. So on the fence about this one, I'm gonna go with a thumbs up only because I might go back only for the music scene."
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",4,8-Dec-14,"I really love exploring Haji Lane, and Going Om is a good rest stop if you get tired of walking around in the heat. The place has a bit of a healthy hippie vibe, which I might happen to love-- I could see it easily existing in Ubud, and even cooler that it's in Singapore. Friendly owners and a super cute little dog that I ended up sharing a seat with. Juice drinks are good, albeit expensive. I didn't even know they had hookah at nights, but I'd imagine that'd be a lot of fun too."
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",5,11-Jul-12,"An epic milestone for humanity....that's the only way I can describe Going Om in one phrase. This place is truly magical in every important aspect you would want a chilled out cafe bar to be. Plus it has a whole spiritual element to it that makes it so unique and different to any other place i've ever been to. Great people all over this bar... not just working there, but the regulars that go to visit the place. The decor of the space is colorful unique and important. They play lovely world chillout music. So if you want to relax, take it easy, try something different... have a chakra lassi at Going Om. They serve them in 7 different colours as alcoholic or non - alcoholic beverages.  They have an incredible goddess by the name of Tian who plays soothing feel good music with a ukulele on thursday nights.  A charming unbeatable cafe on haji lane with infectiously enjoyable parties."
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",4,16-Jul-12,"This place was one of the first few Cafes that opened at Haji Lane - and it still has a nice buzz of people always hanging out, drinking, etc. The ambiance is very chill-out, and the place has a feel - with cushions on the floor, pictures and paintings on the wall, very friendly staff, and the guys that own this place, Barry & Oli are really nice and sweet guys.  What I Love: There's always some activity going on, be it fire juggling, tarot card readings, musicians performing. There are small events, very underground and rave-like, that happen occasionally. The vibe's very underground, creative, artistic and hipster-ish. The second floor is my fave, basic & chill-out, great to hold tiny gatherings. Their food portions are pretty big and the wedges are yummmyyyyy.  What I Don't Love: Their drinks. Their finger food is okay. But drinks-wise, stick to bottled or canned beverages."
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",5,18-Aug-12,"My favourite place to be in the Arab Street/Bali Lane area. The whole vibe is super chilled out and borderline hippie-ish, but a rastafari feel is prevalent as well. Think lots of plants, pretty lights and helpful but laid back service staff.  My favourite place to sit is outside because it's great for people watching. They set up tables along the street (like most places in the district do) and you've got your choice of spots if you go early enough.  What really adds to the laid back feel of Om is that there is no menu. This also ensures that the staff are knowledgeable enough to know everything on the menu, their prices and their discounts. And the prices are pretty cheap too:  Beer (Asahi, Heinken, usual beer options) Liquor (Gin, Vodka, Tequila, Rum, Whiskey) + mixed (free) Cocktails ($12 onwards) Shisha ($25)  If you head upstairs, and you'll have to take your shoes off, there's a cosy little attic which is really good for functions. Spread yourselves out on the floor amidst carpets and cushions, and order plenty of drinks - a bucket of beer is $40 which is great for a group or that one alcoholic friend we all have.  Definitely one of the coolest places in Arab Street simply because it doesn't try."
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",5,14-Mar-13,"I really love the feel of this place. the service is friendly and the ambiance is like no other in Singapore. This is definitely where the hippie minded go and i love it! If the heat outside is too much to bare, than the upstairs is where its at. take your shoes off and smoke some hookah inside. The drinks are nice and it's the only hookah joint I know that has Sam Adams lager beer.  Another good thing about this place seems to be the location. It's close enough from the main area with all the hookah bars and restaurants, but because it's surrounded by shops that close early, people think that part of Haji Lane is dead. Little do they know this hidden gem.  Haven't tried the food, but will definitely do so next time around."
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",5,14-Sep-12,"Fuck. Yes.  If you're looking for damn good shisha or an eclectic community of accordionists, fire eaters, musicians and artists - this is the place to look.  Grab a double apple hookah and enjoy the crowd."
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",5,19-Sep-17,Awesome locale. Hang out and drink some beer/juices...don't forget to pet the dogs. Super chill vibe
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",4,15-Mar-16,"I've been here several times but this is my first time here on a Saturday. Drinks here aren't great but you're really here for the atmosphere - sitting on little stools on the street, listening to great live music by buskers...it'll show you a different side of Singapore which you'll love."
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",5,5-Mar-17,"I spent a lovely Saturday evening with live music and a few beers here. The staff is attentive, but they don't hover. The musicians playing were talented, and attracted a nice crowd. I look forward to frequently visiting this place during my time in Singapore."
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",4,9-Aug-12,"This is one of the shisha joints that I frequent most along the Haji Lane belt. Compared to the other shisha joints such as Nasrin or Narbins, Going Om is so much more tastefully decorated, with their quirky prints and fascinating looking furniture.  Apart from the typical shisha custom mixes such as Apple-Mint, Grape etc, they have a surprise in store for you. If you ask the staff nicely, they whip up a mean ""Vodka-infused"" shisha. Their shisha is smooth on the throat, and is one of the best I've had in Singapore. Ofcourse, comparing it to the shisha joints in Egypt will not be a fair comparison.  Don't bother requesting for a menu, just ask the staff to recommend something for you. Their fried oyster mushroom nibblets were pretty good, and so are their wedges. They offer both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages too."
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",5,15-Jul-12,"A hidden gem in the midst of our bustling city, Going Om is a Cafe Bar with great ambience and a heart - literally! A large, colourful heart is mounted on the hand-painted exterior of the two-storey refurbished shophouse, making it impossible to miss.  In the day, it is a calm and peaceful oasis where lush, tropical plants and exotic eastern meditation music welcome weary shoppers seeking respite from the heat. Crystal healing, yoga classes, intuitive card readings and free meditation sessions are some of the unusual additional services offered here.  At night, the place is transformed and the atmosphere is almost carnival. People from all walks of life converge here. There are live acoustic performances every night, and a roving magician makes an appearance to entertain and befuddle guests on Thursdays. A real treat is when the Starlight Alchemy movement artists make their weekly appearances. They perform with enchanting lights along the entire length and breadth of the narrow little street, delighting all the customers seated along the street.  There is a large variety of flavoured tobacco for shisha, and you can request for custom mixes. However, I have not seen their innovative Watermelon Shisha anywhere else in Singapore.  There is no menu here. While the usual western-styled food and bar snacks are available, the owners at Going Om also whip up their own original creations, so expect new dishes every time you head down. The staples fresh salads with homemade dressings and homemade desserts, such as the ""Strawberry Surprise"" and the ""Apple & Pear Crumble"", are popular dishes here.  The Going Om Chakra drinks are also a must try here. The seven flavours correspond with the seven chakra or energy points in our bodies. They have both alcoholic and non-alcoholic versions."
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",1,4-May-13,"I want to like this place, because they've got a good groove going with the music. But when they take 45mins to bring you your shisha, that's kinda a deal breaker. We checked on our shisha and tried to cancel after 30mins, only to have it delivered 15mins after cancellation. Even trying to pay the bill was a nightmare. I want to like this place but c'mon guys, help me!"
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",5,16-Nov-12,Adore this place. From it's deep fried mushroom salad to juices to shisha to the washroom. Absolutely a place to chill out if you are trying shisha for the first time. I had my first there and had never a bad experience. There was one evening the owner came out with a bottle of maple whiskey for us to try. Epic stuff. Thanks for being so chill and nameste to all.
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",5,28-Oct-14,"Hippie type place, very rare and very refreshing in sometimes too homogenous Singapore. Great music and terrace ambiance on weekend nights !"
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",5,6-Dec-14,"Came in for a coffee. The experience is not only the drinks and a place to char with friends but the whole ambience. How apt ""the gift of life is the present"". The whole setup reminded me about my meditation experience. Quiet, peace, the present, equanimity. It is a good getaway from the busy city life."
Going Om,4.3,19,"Bars, Cafes",4,30-Aug-12,"This is a great place to go to if you want a chill and fun night out in Haji Lane. There are tons of places here in Haji Lane with shisha and drinks but Going Om is probably one of the best places to go to.  There is an outdoor and upstairs attic to sit in and both are really relaxed and causal. They have an array of cocktails and beers and you can get a bucket for $40.  Sisha here is really good, they have lots of flavors and my favorite is apple mint. The staff here is super friendly and very nice. The place has a really chill and artistic vibe."
Curate,5,2,Pop-Up Restaurants,5,3-Oct-16,"in this case, to bring you michelin starred restaurants, from all over the world, so you don't have to leave SG!  partially hidden behind planted shrubs, in a weak attempt to avoid catching the sharp radar eyes of pokemon trainers, is an oasis, painstakingly put together to showcase the biggest names in the culinary theatre, with a new name popping up every two months or so.  just completed is series 3, the one i had the privilege of indulging in, featuring star-studded Chef Esben Holmboe Bang of Norwegian restaurant Maaemo. some pre-dinner pokemon hunting at rws, worked up our thirst and appetite but it was the sg climate friendly, tranquil setting, away from the humidity and heat that pleased the senses the most upon arrival!  the next big thing was being greeted by esben and his warm, firm, reassuring handshake! i think we are in good hands?  next, the kitchen and the service teams seamlessly harmonized to deliver an exalting experience.  the wine pairing was sublime and seemingly bottomless. they were almost apologetic when our wine glasses were dry, before the next course could arrive, and generously offered top ups! indeed it was through no fault of theirs, the fault was in the wines, too good to sip and i barbarically gulped them down! this must be the only wine pairing dinner that i have actually emptied, every glass they served me!  i don't think i can fault any of them exquisite dishes, you norwegians are so lucky to have esben, and you know it.  the five star experience was cemented by the capturing of the oh so cute pokemon chansey, right outside their main entrance. yes, you can spin pokestops and catch pokemons throughout your entire meal here, no wonder time just flew by! am just a tad sad the pokemon gym was just a little beyond reach.  otherwise, i am looking forward to returning in november for series 4, when ramon freixa flaunts his artistry."
Curate,5,2,Pop-Up Restaurants,5,6-Apr-18,"First off, lets just give this place a Michelin star already!!! Chef Benjamin Halat is one of the best chefs I've had the privilege of dining with. The 8 course meal he prepared for my wife and I was divine! The theme of the meal was fall in Germany and it was packed with renditions of traditional and childhood foods he had growing up. the first course was serve in the wine cellar because it was warm and the cellar was a bit nippy. So many considerations went into this meal. I can't begin to articulate with any decency the quality and craftsmanship of this meal. Curate is a small space with not too many tables so here is enough room to breath and enough space for the servers and chef to come out and speak without being drowned out by noise. The d¨¦cor was filled with copper and light and was extremely welcoming. All of the alcohol pairings were spot on and the service staff were excellent. This was the first time I've ever eaten a course with tweezers! It was weird and it was fun. One of those experiences I will never forget. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for high end, well articulated cuisine.  Not so humbly submitted, Michael C."
Tanglin Food Hall,4,4,Food Court,3,24-Mar-23,"It's a mall food court with a section for pop up shops that's occasionally open. Feels super nice but upon closer inspection, after ordering, and eating it, it's just greasy, cheap food. Obviously depends on where you go. Review the individual restaurants, not the entire gfood court."
Tanglin Food Hall,4,4,Food Court,4,29-Jan-21,Comfy place to sit for a meal from various countries pricing about +20% more than Kopitiam; food quality good.
Tanglin Food Hall,4,4,Food Court,4,22-Jan-14,"Tasty Food Court is a pretty reliable food center. So far, I've tried the Chicken Rice, Fish Ball Noodle, and Vegetarian Indian Food Stations.  So far I'd say Veggie Indian and Fish Ball Noodle Soup Food Stations are pretty good and generous in their serving size and quality.  The Chicken Rice station's awe-ite. The chicken congee didn't have any flavor to it. The rice from the chicken rice also wasn't tasty enough.  Definitely a viable food option nearby if you're in the area. The pricing is reasonable too though probably not the best value.  The service at all the stations was excellent, fast, reliable, and efficient.  A special prop to the Veggie Indian Station. The sizzling sound if food cooking in the kitchen is what drew me there.  Sometimes, sounds can influence the stomach too."
Tanglin Food Hall,4,4,Food Court,5,17-Oct-18,Great relatively inexpensive food court located at the basement of the tanglin mall. The food was great for a snack or those seeking lunch while in the mall. Just be sure to bring your own napkins!
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",4,27-Apr-24,"You must try chili crab in Singapore if you're a fan of spicy seafood! We made a reservation for 1pm and came here for lunch, just in time for the weekday 3-course lunch special. The lunch special includes a choice of main, beverage, and dessert for $19.90~ SGD. the chili crab itself is pricey, but it's meant to be shared.  I got the Signature Holycrab Fried Rice while my friend got the Scorched Vermicelli. For dessert, they got our order wrong, so they gave both options free of charge. These dishes went well with our chili crab and made it a fulfilling meal.  The chili crab was excellent and full of flavor, it is messy to eat, but that's the way to enjoy it. The fried rice was also delicious and was pretty great fried rice. I was not a big fan of the Scorched Vermicelli, it didn't taste flavorful, and I mostly just tasted the burnt parts. The desserts were not my cup of tea either.  Overall, definitely come for the chili crab and the fried rice was a great entree option as well."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,21-Jan-24,"I had to get Chili Crab while I was in Singapore. So glad I did!  I made a reservation for 1 for lunch later the same day. When I got there, they had just put out a sign that they were out of crabs and were calling people with reservations to tell that their shipment of crab was delayed until dinner and did they want to reschedule. It turns out they had one crab left they had set aside for me. As a solo diner, sometimes it feels like I'm treated as an afterthought. Not at Holy Crab. Feels like they gave great service to everyone, including me."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,13-Apr-23,"My gf found this place on yelp and saw the amazing ratings and decided to give it a try. The location is a bit hard to find as we entered through a small alley way. We made a reservation before hand which they had but there were also tables open so I saw a few people walk in. We decided to order:  1. Crab Fried Rice: SOOO GOOD! There are huge chunks of crab in the rice and the rice itself was perfectly cooked and seasoned. It wasn't too salty either like a lot of places make it so it went amazingly with the sweet and sour pumba.  2. Sweet and sour Pumba: Incredible! This was by far the best dish of the night. The pork was so flavorful and crunchy. The sauce was so addicting I wanted to lick the plate clean. One of the best dishes we had in Singapore.  3. Thai chili crab: Literally Holy Crab this crab was massive. It was the biggest crab I've ever eaten. There was so much meat inside and the meat was so sweet and delicious. The Thai Chili was labeled as 1 spicy star however and it was super super spicy. My gf and I have very low tolerance but this was definitely more spicy than we expected. The bread that went with the crab was incredible but we definitely over ordered and couldn't eat any more bread.  4. Slushy: SOOOO GOOD! Perfect sweetness and the slush was so amazing with the hot weather.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Overall, this place was amazing. The food was incredible but what blew us away the most was actually the fried rice and sweet and sour pork. The crab was also good but it was a bit pricey (about $150-200 USD.) The flavor and size was mindblowing though but I wish it was less spicy. Definitely would be back for the Pumba and rice!"
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",1,5-Feb-24,"We went there on February the 5th, at about 1pm, so the place was dead. There was only one other table sitting in the front. The girl sat us down with menu and never came back. Didn't even asked us if we wanted to order drinks, which we did since we just came from outside the hot sun. 10mn later, the two girls still walking around talking, basically ignoring us so we just left. Singapore is filled to the brim with good seafood place, we will take our money somewhere else."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,6-Dec-23,"One of the best places to try chili crab. They give you gloves, an apron, napkins and a towel so you know it's serious and messy"
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,17-Oct-22,"I just had the best crab in my life at Holy Crab! Chili crab and 5 pieces of fried bun. The chili sauce is heavenly, with the meaty crab making perfect harmony. Highly recommend if you are in Singapore. The 1KG at S$90 is more than enough for myself."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",3,26-Dec-22,Not quite my cup of tea as seafood was never my strong suit. Everything comes out in a kind of tapas style dishes to be shared for the entire table. There are limited meat items which I found to range from good but not great to even bland. The chili crab looked impressive and if that's your bag baby you might want to add a star (or two)!
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",3,16-Dec-23,"Food is average, chili crab is so-so. Service is very good. Ambiance is good. Does not meet expectations."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,3-Sep-22,"I suggest making reservations. I called last minute because other places with more reviews were all booked. Thank goodness they had a table for us because I couldn't leave Singapore without trying some chili crab. We came for an early dinner but the restaurant quickly filled up.  First time trying Singaporean chili crab so I have nothing to compare it to, but this place was delicious! Everything we ordered was good, but my favorite was the crab. That sauce....a little sweet, a bit too spicy for me, but I got used to the heat and omg, definitely the highlight of my first trip to Singapore. Dipping the fried mantou in the sauce-I just wish I had a bigger appetite so I could ask for more mantou and not waste any of that sauce.  I came here with my tween/teen kids and while it was very spicy for them, they also enjoyed it. They just drank a lot water with their meal."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,4-Nov-19,"If your desire for Singapore's supposed classic dish has grown stronger with every ad you see for it, you will not go wrong with HolyCrab. It's all about the signature dish here. You can get the classic dish, Singapore Chili Crab, which we did. The also have their own variations. The Green Mumbo was suggested and I must say it's sauce was the best, even better than the classic.  Our service was excellent. Explanations and suggestions were generous.  One note of caution: pricing. You pay per 100 grams of crab, live weight. The crab is not weighed before you so you don't really know what you are in for as far as the total bill. You are told the crabs range to 1KG and up. At our night, the Green Mumbo was 1.5kg, so 150 Singaporean dollars, or about $120US.  But you don't have to get a crab each. If you are just wanting to try the best of Singapore, one crab per table of 4, with plenty of fry bread and other accompaniment should be fine. I strongly recommend the pork belly bits.  I know. Shoot me for ordering pork at a seafood restaurant."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",3,21-Oct-19,"For a place that has crab in the namesake, I definitely expected better. I was embarrassed to take a coworker here for the first chili crab experience. It turned out to be far too sweet and not enough spice for the whole package. The mantou (bun) they serve with the crab is also different than what you would expect - it's a giant one and not the small fried ones.  Interesting selection of beer though - be warned if you're going to expense the meal if you order the Fucking Hell beer. The receipt will say ""Beer - Fucking Hell"" on the itemized list; might raise some questions."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,4-Apr-22,"Friendly and great owner , prompt service staff . Food is good , though I've crab allergy .  I only had noodles & other non-seafood foods , but I have never had any food allergy.  Cleanliness is very high standard - which is very , very good as I've had bad food allergies at other seafood restaurants before."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,7-Jan-20,Damn it's good. Damn it's pricey. Make a reservation because it's a small place with limited seating and people get easily turned away. Start with one crab and a just some sides before deciding you want more- we ordered two and it was more than two of us could handle!
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,27-Feb-23,The food was super delicious and the service quick and courteous. Highly recommend this place. The only thing I would recommend is for the owner to update the address on Yelp as it's incorrect. The correct address can be found on Google. Make sure to make reservations to avoid a long wait. Enjoy!
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",4,27-Oct-19,This place was good. A bit basic.  Crab fried rice was the best.  The beer was a novelty.
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,28-Jan-19,"A Must -- Fantastic Chili Crab!  Best chili-crab we've had -- try the chef's special green chili. And definitely get the buns to soak up the sauce. Fun spot, great vibe.  Quality was excellent, fresh crab (you get to preview your meal before it's cooked!) excellent flavor, and the sauce is better than other places.  Chef/Owner Elton is awesome -- super-friendly, super-helpful, and perfects an already great experience."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",3,17-Apr-19,"I read alot of rave reviews of the green mamba crab so i decided to try this place out. I thought it would be a very unique experience, however, it tasted just like a normal curry crab. The crab price is also similar to other top places for seafood. The crab meat was also mediocre, nothing extraordinary nothing bad. The noodles were also mediocre. Strong flavors but nothing special. Clams were average. The vegatable was the best tasting dish of the night and very fresh."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",4,19-Oct-19,"A fantastic find near to Bugis Junction  We were keen on finding a place to indulge our passion for Singapore chilli crab. We happened across this small, clean and wonderfully friendly restaurant located quite close to the Intercontinental Hotel. It didn't disappoint. The service was fast and the food excellent. We went with a chilli crab and a white pepper crab. We could have done with just one, but hey, we don't get to Singapore all that often. Highly recommended."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,14-Dec-19,"I was introduced to this place by a friend that lives in Singapore. It is a less known location and not as commercial as Jumbo Seafood and others. But you get a more local feel here. The service was great having them explain the items to you. Make sure you know how large the crab will be, because I did not know, and it made a big dent on our final tab.  We ordered the White Pepper Crab and the Chili Crab. It was my first time with the White Pepper Crab, and I enjoyed that more than the Chili Crab. The Chili Crab here has more of a mala taste to the chili. I also liked dipping the mantou into the White Pepper Crab more. We also got the clams and some veggies. All very tasty and done well.  They offer gloves and utensils. Get a coconut as a drink. Our crabs came out to be around 1.5kg. So our check was over $300. One crab is plenty for 3 people, even 4, but we went all out."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,4-Nov-19,"The crab and seafood fried rice is delicious, the bok choy is flavorful, but the stars of the show were the 48 day aged wagyu, which was cooked to perfection and the Atlantic cod which was crispy and soft in all the right places. Unfortunately, we didn't get any crab during this visit but we'll be back! The service is phenomenal. It's a hip new vibe with limited seating. They take reservations so if you don't have one- you might be waiting for a while."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,2-Jan-20,"Food was amazing, I highly recommend this place. The wait team is very helpful and provide great recommendations."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,20-Nov-19,"We didn't make reservation since we didn't know when we're done with sightseeing. 6pm and we were the only customer. Service was great. Price is pretty steep but we only visit Singapore once a year and we wanted to eat the best. Did not disappoint!! We tried the combination, half red sauce and the other green. If we come back next year, we'll stick with Red sauce. It's really GOOD!!"
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,16-Jul-19,"Update: I strongly recommended Holycrab to my good friend Cesar and crew who are arriving from overseas. Please take good care of him! Cheers!  PS: salted duck egg and green chili are the best! Again, this place is THE new standard in Singaporean chili crab ."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,18-Jun-18,Simply amazing crab (and service)! I would dub this the new standard in Singaporean chili crab.
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,8-Oct-19,"We had dreams of chili crab ever since we booked our flight to Singapore. While we received many recommendations to various spots, this place stood out with some of the best reviews. They didn't disappoint. We got a larger crab, prepped two ways - traditional and black pepper. We couldn't' decide which we liked better because both were so delicious. We also ordered some fried buns to soak up the sauce. It was our first full meal in Singapore during our trip, and we could not have picked out a better place to kick off our trip. The staff was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. I'd wholeheartedly recommend anyone to come check them out."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,19-Jun-19,The chili crab is delicious! I would highly recommend the crab fried rice! We are still talking about it the next day.
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,4-Apr-19,"Our latest great find!  Our group went for the green chilli crab, and worked our way through the whole menu. Every dish we ordered was a certifiable hit! The green chilli crab and the bread particularly raised the standards--we had chilli crab and bread in another recommended place the next day which paled in comparison. The owner/chef Elton was himself very visible but unobtrusive and respectful of our privacy, until we called him and he came quite warm and chatty with his inside stories of the different dishes and offerings, which further increased our appreciation of the food and the total experience.  A must for you to try once, and come back to every time you go to Singapore!"
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",4,11-Dec-18,Amazing crab dishes. Big and fat crabs for crab lovers. I would definitely recommend to my families and friends.
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",4,27-May-19,"Green Mamba crab is full of flavor, very strong lime leaves. The black pepper is delicious and sweet. Large crabs with sweet meat. We had the lightly fried bread, highly recommended to soak up the sauce. Garlic vegetables hit the spot. Very friendly service. I like that they provide a bowl of lemon lime leaf water to clean your hands afterwards, so they don't smell like chili."
Holycrab,4.4,29,"Singaporean, Chinese, Seafood",5,21-Apr-19,Recommended by a friend and was not disappointed. Cold beer and unique take on crab preparations. We got the green curry crabs and stir fried vegetables. As a starter we had deep fried pork bellies (excellent with the cold beer). Very close to JW Marriott and Raffles. Highly recommend reservations. We will go again.
Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,3,9-Dec-23,Over priced and underwhelming! The hotel concierge told us to go there for the chili-crab. Wasn't crazy about the accompanying sauce or lofty prices. We were subsequently told that there are much better places to go for that specialty.

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,29-May-22,"Prices for the Chili Crab were wild! But food was actually very good. There were three of us and we split Chili crab, half garlic chicken, some greens, rice, and buns. Everything tasted good. Food came out quickly. Service was good! We were also ""walk ins"" and did not have a reservation. We were told wait would be 30-40 mins but got our table within 10 mins. Definitely worth checking out for the chili crab alone but be prepared to pay a lot!"

End up we stood up and asked for bill, we don't wanna wait anymore! Guess what? Food came at my table right away! Why ? I told my grab driver what happened and he apologized on behalf of Singapore as he knows jumbo is a famous Singapore signature. He felt shame as well.

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,2,4-Mar-20,It was alright. Prby not worth the hype. We went early so got in when the opened but felt like the service was counting down the minutes before they needed the table back. It was very much turn and burn. To the point of having the time listed on a card at your table displayed so they all knew when we needed to be done. Not really what I look too when spending over $400 on a dinner for 4 (2 kids in that mix). There are more favorable local places I wish I would have gone too.

I think Red House seems less touristy but is definitely 2X expensive. So maybe Jumbo if you're on a ""budget""  This location is on the water so if you're patient wait for outdoor seating. Nothing like eating a delicious crab with a cold beer on the warm banks of Singapore. We were lucky to go once with a local... who ordered coffee pork - apart from crab, this is one dish to try! So delicious  Chili pepper crab, black pepper crab, bread. Try all of these! One crab per person is a good measure so bring a couple of friends to try variety!"

Never seen people serve food with so much enthusiasm and smiles before, so this was excellent! The ambience was nice and relaxed, music was good and not too loud.  We had the Hokkaido scallops, Gnocchi and Taglierini. And I'm no food critic but all I can say is that it was delicious and we enjoyed it and the whole experience."
Fynn's,4.8,4,"International, Bars",4,17-Oct-18,As this was close by our hotel (JW Marriott) we thought a quick stop by for a drink and snack was in order. Our server Bjorn was an excellent host and guided us through our drink selections along with snacks of preference. Nothing disappointed. an excellent sports bar with plenty of TV's for different selections and a good time atmosphere prevailed.

Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,3,9-Jun-24,"First time here, we ordered the month special Unagi with scallop  Taste 1/1* What wonderful bowl of Unagi, fresh, crispy edges, nicely seasoned, with fresh wasabi  Value 0.5/1* 50 for a bowl of unagi and scallop still going to be on the expensive side, was not outstanding enough to be well worth it  Service 1/1* Fast and friendly, though gotta mention, no one came to help carry stroller in and out  Cleanliness 0/1* I wanted to like the place, but gave me the feeling of a dirty basement  Overall/Revisit 0.5/1* Would revisit if wife's in the mood for it  Paying for ambience? 0/-1* NO Above and beyond? 0/+1* NO"
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,14-Dec-22,Tried Hitsumabushi for the first time in Singapore and it was amazing! It's a different way of eating unadon - you take a little bit of eel and rice into a bowl and eat it with dashi stock. SO GOOD! It's definitely on the pricier side but so worth it. The eel had so much flavor and it was nice to be able to eat it with the broth. Gonna be on the lookout for this in Japan.
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,1-Oct-19,"We came here at 12:30 pm on a Monday and there was NO line.  Taste 5/5: If you love unagi, your dream will come true. Really flavorful unagi, perfect sauce on top and perfectly bbq. The level of attention to its detail is great - love the fresh wasabi you are getting for you to make fresh wasabi yourself  Price/Value 5/5: For a midsize set you pay S$29 and for a large set S$39. Yes it's more expensive than hawker center but you get quality food and we are talking about unagi, a fresh wasabi, a soup and you get a good portion of it. I'd recommend the large size if you crave unagi. I ordered the midsize one and regretted after the first bite to not have taken the large size one  This place is perfect for lunch or generally if you just want to get food quickly. It's not a place for a candle light dinner where you sit for hours. We'd come here again for sure!"
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,15-Jan-20,"I came across Man Man some time ago while walking from Duxton Road to Keong Saik Road. I only mention this bit of information because Man Man is tucked in the back of a shophouse which faces Keong Saik Road, while Man Man itself faces a pedestrian access path / park that people typically use as a shortcut. Despite it's hidden location, apparently queues here for their dinner service can reach up to an hour or more. Having just had lunch there (I hate lining up), I can see why people go through the trouble of waiting.  At the top of the steps and just inside the glass doors leading into Man Man are 3 large, thigh-high tanks with water flowing into them. These tanks are home to live Anguilla japonica - Japanese eels, or (once grilled) ""unagi"". It is quite fitting that one's first encounter upon stepping foot into Man Man is the main course because it truly is the star of the show here. The restaurant has tables spread out in the oddly shaped space, along with a bar counter that faces both the chopping board, where the eels presumably shuffle off their mortal coil, and the binchotan grill where they get transformed into unagi.  The menu features several types of hitsumabushi (a specialty of Nagoya city), unadon and smaller side dishes (such as unagi cooked in tamago). I settled on a large unadon, which was served within 5-10 minutes and was the perfect size for lunch. Without going into too much detail, not all unagi is created equal, and sometimes you end up with something that has the consistency and texture of chewing on a rubber hose. This is NOT the case at Man Man, where they serve the real deal, and which is the perfect combination of flaky meat combined with the slight crunchy/chewiness of the charred skin.  Barring a plane trip to Japan, this is one of the most authentic unagi meals you will ever have anywhere (with my benchmark being Marushizu in Tokyo). Coming to a total of S$45.65 (after service and tax), it is also a lot cheaper than that plane ticket. For that price, you will not leave hungry as the unagi is served on a generous portion of rice, with a small tofu appetizer, gari (pickled ginger) and a bowl of suimono (clear soup), along with a cup of cold barley tea. The only thing I recommend is asking for the sansho pepper as a touch of the ground pepper really rounds out the flavor of the unagi.  Oh, and they have takeaway too if you really hate lining up!"
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,4,9-Jan-17,"The restaurant was the latest by Chef Teppei. Interestingly the entrance to the place was at the back. Reached the place about 20 minutes before it opened and there was a queue of about 15 persons in front of me. The 6 counter seats were the first to fill up. The place was quite smoky. One could even smell the smoky grilling smell before entering the place. The place was decorated in a light wooden look. By the way I did see a customer who bought a couple of fresh eels back too. Tables were placed quite near to each other. There was barely place for bags but lucky I selected a table by the shelf, therefore got place in the shelf for bag.  On the table, there was condiments such as sweet sauce, unagi sauce, spicy, Japanese pepper and chilli powder to help yourself to. Refillable Iced tea was served.  Kimoyaki (Liver) ($9.80+) Looked quite charred, It was chewy with smoky although it was a tab bitter at certain parts.  Yahatamaki ($14.80+) Unagi roll stuffed with pickled radish in it. Crunchy and tangy.  Large Kouhaku Histsumabushi ($39.90+) Unagi Served with Mentaiko Sauce, Soup, Pickles, Broth, Spices. The dish was a January special.  To eat Histsumabushi, divide the serving into 4 parts. 1) Have one serving in the small bowl which is also known as torizara, to enjoy the dish in its original tasteyakumi 2) Second serving, add the yakumi (condiments such as fresh wasabi, chopped spring onions and green onions). I spend quite a lot of time busy grating the wasabi. The fresh wasabi really peaked up the dish. 3) Third serving, add the lightly-flavored dashi (made from simmering fish or meat) broth. The dish reminded one of teochew porridge. 4) Eat the Last Serving the way You Like best. As for me, I like it with the broth and freshly grated wasabi in it.  The layer of Mentaiko Sauce was a tab too little to make a different to the dish.  Although there was long queue, most customers finished their meals quite fast."
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,27-Jan-17,"Man oh man what a unagi place!  Ever since I watched Friends I have been wanting to eat Japanese Unagi but all past attempts were just soso (even in Japan) and in my opinion could never compete with Western eel dishes.  However, as I am a sucker for Japanese food I had to give Unagi one more try. Thank God, I did because the Hitsumabushi set (eel three ways) is one of the most delicious meals I had in a long time. I had the large set: it was way too much food but I still finished all since it was so good.  Aaaaaand, although the restaurant is super busy the service is awesome. All wait staff is mega friendly and attentive (yes for regular tea top-ups).  So, delicious food and awesome service: 5 stars!! Worth the hype!"
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,27-Jun-18,"Be prepared to queue for a long time for this place!  But it is completely, 100% worth it, because eating here was SPIRITUAL experience for me.  All the ingredients are so fresh. The taste of everything is perfect. The unagi is so crispy, yet tender because it is grilled to perfection. They give you real wasabi to grate, and that was so delicious. I honestly savored every bite. I could eat this every day."
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,16-Mar-19,"Man Man is a very well-known restaurant in Singapore, and I can definitely see why now! The unagi here is some of the best that I've ever had! Just know that the queue can get quite long, so I would recommend showing up before it opens. Otherwise, you'll end up waiting outside in the heat. This place is a bit pricey as well, you'll probably spend around S$30+ per person here.  Food: - Unagi Hitsumabushi: This is basically an unagi-don set, with a broth that you can pour on to the rice, plus miso soup. I would definitely recommend adding the broth as well, which mixes fantastically with the taste of the unagi. I got this in the regular size, and this was plenty of food for me. - Unagi Bone Crackers: We got this as an appetizer, and it was surprisingly good! The crackers are very crispy and had a nice smokey taste to them.  Wait: I arrived at 11:40am on a Saturday for lunch (it opens at 11:30), and waited about 35min. I've heard the line can definitely get over an hour, so would recommend going early if possible."
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,28-Jul-17,"Oooooh-nagi  And so, the 2017 Michelin Singapore Guide is out, with a bunch of new entries and new recommendations.  One of them? Man Man Japanese Unagi Restaurant. I've heard the reviews, I've seen the queues and I have to admit, my first reaction was, ""crazy, I won't queue for that"". How wrong I was. If not for my colleague suggesting Man man for a group dinner, I might have never gone to try it, despite my love for Unagi.  #1 Tip. If you're going to be arriving anytime after 5.30pm, be prepared to wait. We got there at 5.20pm (our office is pretty nearby) and still ended up being the 6-7th group in the queue.  The restaurant is small and cozy and really reminds you of Japan. What makes this restaurant different from other restaurants serving Unagi? The Unagi is freshly killed, skewered and grilled in the restaurant.  Medium Donburi ($25.80+) We decided to go with the basic, although the sight of everyone having the Hitsumabushi made us regret that decision a bit (oh well, gives me a reason to come back).  After one bite, all I could say was......... life changing. What ever idea I had of what a good unagi should be and taste like went completely out the window. The sauce was flavourful without overpowering the natural sweetness of the eel and the eel.... oh my. It was tender, juicy, it melts in your mouth and tasted so.... pure (I can't even find the right words to describe it).  Bottom line, I can see why it received its Bib Gourmand. Only draw back would be the queue but despite that, it still easily gets 5 stars from me."
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,28-Oct-18,"Definitely something to get when you missed the unagi don from Japan. Their Hitsumabashi is really what you will get at Japan, totally in love with the crispy & soft texture. Good stuff that is worth our time to queue for it."
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,29-Oct-16,"Love this place a lot!  They import their live unagi from Japan and they guarantee that this is the cheapest place to enjoy Japanese unagi in SG. My partner had the kabayaki unagi set $26.8 and I had the shiraiyaki set with the same price.  The unagi tasted really really fresh! My partner and I agreed that Man Man Unagi tasted better than the one in Japan with one michelin star. We also had mini unagi with vinegar as appetizer, really nice but a bit too salty and tamago which was really fluffy & delicious. I was also lucky because I didn't have to queue as I came during odd hour, otherwise be prepared to wait at least an hour. Location a little hidden, but the area outside the restaurant is very conducive for queuing, me thinks!"
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,15-Dec-19,"Easy to get to from the MRT. When I got here, there was a long line in the rain.. but the unagi was SO worth it. By far the best unagi I have had. The unagi was so fresh, delicate yet we'll flavored. There are freshwater eels in the restaurant (in a tank), so I'm guessing thats how the freshness is maintained. The bento don let's you experiment with how you want to eat it - with soup, wasabi, seaweed, sauces, or all of the above! It is a little pricey at $29++, but definitely worth it when you feel like treating yourself!"
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,4,11-Dec-16,"Really nicely chargrilled unagi - shipped in weekly from Japan and grilled by a team of Japanese Pretty authentic experience  However don't think the broth meal is worth getting , not too much a difference for the three different ways you can have the unagi and rice ; then again we were not porridge people  $20 odd for a meal - hearty and nice though long crowds expected due to the small restaurant tucked in keong siak - worth the wait though!"
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,17-Jul-18,"The best unagi I have ever eaten! I didn't know about this place until my friend recommended to me. You won't miss this place with its long queue outside the entrance. Everyone is orderly with a small number queuing right outside the door and an empty passage way for pedestrians to walk through then the longer queue starts so don't be deceived if you only see a few people at the door. My friend and I waited an hour which would have been longer if we were a bigger group. The place is pretty small which explains the long queue. We got a seat near the counter where they prepared the food. We were lucky to face the side of grilling the unagi instead of the side of slicing the unagi which was quite a bloody and unpleasant sight. You can also choose not to look up and just dig into your food. The unagi had really crispy skin and tender meat. To justify the waiting time to myself, I ordered the medium portion which was definitely filling and satisfying. We each paid about $30 which is value for money given the quality and portion of the food. Service was also polite and pretty attentive."
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,23-Dec-18,"Extremly delightful. I was visiting my gf in SG and she took me to this unagi heaven. The signature menu with seaweed soup is worth to have. If you are planning to visit SG, this is where you must go."
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,29-Jul-17,"What a sinful Saturday... This is my second attempt to dine in this restaurant. First time I quit because the queue was ridiculously long... and I determined that I would succeed this time. The dinner starts at 6pm. We arrived at 5pm, and we were the second in the queue. Less than 10mins, another 10 more group arrived... and by 5.30pm I couldn't see the tail of queue at all. Not exaggerating... it's really loooooooong queue! It is a small restaurant, and if you miss the first round, it will take another 1hr to come to your turn. They don't limit the time, means you can eat as slow as you want. The unagi is so delicious. It is so fresh as they slaughter the eels on the spot. It is so yummy that the price is no longer important. The staffs are very friendly and know very well the food they serve. I ordered Hitsumabushi, and I love it! I am not a porridge person but i am really falling in love with this one. My favorite is adding the unagi rice to the soup, and sprinkle the spring onion and seaweed. And I like to grate some fresh wasabi on top. The price range is $30 per person. Reasonable for this quality."
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,13-Jan-17,"Having lived in Nagoya, I really miss hitsumabushi, or grilled eel eaten several ways, e.g. with rice, with wasabi, with soup, etc. My benchmark for hitsumabushi is Atsuta-Horaiken in Nagoya, so it's quite high. So I was excited to hear from my Japanese salon that a place specializing in hitsumabushi opened up nearby. I finally had a chance to check out Man Man, and I can say that the experience exceeded expectations! Sure it helps that the eels are shipped live from the Nagoya region. But the execution of the dish also was excellent, with just the right amount of sauce and char. Service was also excellent (and no service fee either!). The place fills up quickly on weekdays for lunch, but seems to also empty fairly quickly, so if you would like to avoid a queue, come a bit later around 1. Definitely a great addition to the Japanese food scene in Singapore!"
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,11-Mar-17,"Man Man Unagi stands out in Singapore as a restaurant that is passionate about serving quality, authentic chargrilled unagi at accessible prices. The entrance is humbly tucked in a back alley that you might not notice if you weren't looking for it. As you walk in, you're greeted by nothing less than two pools of live unagi. I like a restaurant that knows what they stand for and isn't shy about it.  Around 8:30pm on a Thursday, there wasn't too much of a line and we were seated almost immediately. Most of the tables are cozy, which is typical of a Japanese restaurant, so smaller groups are more ideal.  Most come here to try unagi three ways, and that's exactly what I got, the Butamabushi for S$18.80+. The unagi was so fresh and perfectly basted. Basically the three ways are unagi with rice, unagi mixed with the side ingredients (seaweed, scallion, and wasabi), and lastly unagi with the ingredients and with a soup/dashi broth. You actually divide the serving into four parts, and the last part is eaten in your favorite way. My favorite was with seaweed and a hint of wasabi.  The refillable ice green tea was also very welcome, and I'm glad they didn't pinch on small things like drinks. We also got a small side dish of unagi bone crackers for S$6, which probably wasn't necessary, but it was different and fun.  Bravo for going all out on unagi by sourcing and preparing it like nobody else in Singapore."
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,15-Feb-19,Worth the queue and money too Fresh eel and I like to scrap the fresh wasabi Just hope they can expand and have more seats
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,1-Jun-19,"They basically do one thing here and it is eel. Also it is really good. I mean really, really good. There will probably be a line formed outside at any time of the day. Don't hesitate to wait in that line, because the absolutely fresh barbecued eel on rice is worth it. They have a tank of eels in the restaurant, and so your meal was probably swimming 10 minutes before you ate it. The portion is good-sized but not huge, so at least order the medium size eel/rice bowl, which is about $19 US."
Man Man Japanese Unagi,4.7,22,Japanese,5,6-Jan-17,"A very small restaurant that specialises in eel rice. The food gets five stars. The eel is chargrilled to perfection, and served on a bed of short-grained white rice, with a side of fresh wasabi. The price is reasonable for the quality. This place does not take reservations so wait times can be long. The line that forms outside the restaurant on the park connector makes it awkward for others using the park connector. The ventilation of the restaurant is also wanting, you will leave smelling like grilled fish!"
Chimichanga,4.5,2,Mexican,5,8-Dec-22,"The best Mexican food in Little India. The service was excellent. The only thing that would make it better, was if they served their margaritas on the rocks. We had the carne asada bowl and the chimichanga, both were very flavorful, finished every bite."
Chimichanga,4.5,2,Mexican,4,21-Oct-17,"It's called Chimichangas and it serves chimichangas. Crispy on the outside, sizzling and moist on the inside. Love the food. And the vibe is good too. And besides the Mexican food, once a month they host the only Goth Club Night in Singapore, with the Singapore Dark Alternative Movement (Singapore Goths who enjoy Gothic, Industrial and Darkwave music)."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,30-Jan-24,"Lots of food to choose from. Quite frankly, I had decided on a different restaurant for lunch, but they had a hand-written note up on the door that they were closed until 5 pm....so the Banana Leaf it was.  We had the chicken tikka masala and the tandoori prawns. Paid extra for unlimited rice and veg (the veg was cabbage and some sort of zucchini or squash thing). All the food was quite good. Although I'd pass on the cabbage next time, since we were taking a flight later. Prawns were my favorite. They came with a small bowl of mint sauce (which of course goes with everything!) Tikka masala was spicy but not overly killing the tastebuds with heat.  You get seated at a table inside (plenty of room), and already at the table is a basket of papadum. Mom was starving so those went quickly. With the food, rice, a glass of wine for her, and a Tiger beer for me, the total bill for lunch was $SGD90. Pricy compared to street food, but not at all pricy for sitting in air-con in a nice restaurant.  This was definitely NOT the Banana Leaf restaurant, which was a tiny hole in the wall on a corner, I went to nearly 40 years ago. I'll just have to go back to Little India and explore the streets"
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",5,10-Dec-23,"The specialty of Banana Leaf Apolo is fish head curry, a uniquely Singaporean dish made with South Indian spices, pineapple, tomato, and okra, but the star ingredient was the whole head of a red snapper! There was a surprising amount of meat in the boney head, which went perfectly with the spicy curry and vegetables. Each diner ate off a banana leaf (yes, this makes a difference for the flavor experience!), and on the side came a basket of papad crackers for crunch. We also ordered the freshly-baked Tandoori Roti and Ajwain Lachcha Paratha to eat with the curries, as well as the vegetables of the day (cabbage mixed with dal, spiced eggplant), both of which were flavorful and delicious. Overall, this was a great restaurant to experience the best of Singaporean and South Indian flavors!"
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,22-Jan-24,This Banana leaf restaurant is an institution in Singapore. I used to eat there very often when I was a little girl with my family and I was so happy to go back again with my Mom after so long. I love the simple ambiance and fast service.The food is just delicious and of course their Fish Head Curry is a must order! It really is the best in town with a unique spicy taste and a perfect hint of subtile sourness. Another favorite is the Prawn Masala and the Bhindi Masala. And of course the Naan to be dipped in all these delicious sauces. There are many dishes to choose from so best to go in a group to be able to order a wide selection of dishes.
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,25-Apr-23,"Team had outing farewell dinner for a coworker here, group of seven, and we were seated right after walked in. And one of teammates is super good at picking authentic dishes here, also those tastes approved by my Indian coworkers. The most interesting dish is the curry fish head. And spicy level is acceptable, mild to medium. The meat tasted juicy and flavorful, the nan very fresh and hot. The mango lassi is rich and good . Not too loud during our dinner there, even not too much smiles from the waiters, they were really responsive on requests."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,15-Oct-23,"Summary based on many dinners, most pre Covid and one ""post"" Covid. -Food good, but choose carefully. Best value can be something like fish curry or sambal fish instead of fish head curry, which is a pain to eat. Market price Sri Lankan crab is ok once with at least two people. Consider briyani rice with veg and naan + whatever protein. -service good -prices good. Credit cards accepted. -washrooms good -location good if you're staying nearby. Beware of at least one nearby place that has a similar name."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",5,5-Jan-24,"Great place in little India. The ambience and food was awesome. Had tandoori prawns, mutton sukka and mutton biryani. Great taste on all. Highly recommended"
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",3,20-Feb-18,"This is our go-to place for many years for fish head curry. Generally the food is excellent and service decent.  The last visit was not up to the usual standard. We got there early around 1145am before the lunch crowd descended.  Maybe we were too early that the kitchen staff forgot what we wanted. Or maybe we rejected whatever the assistant manager recommended and he was unhappy and placed in the wrong order.  So our medium size fish head curry came without the garnishes. No pineapple or coriander. It looked woefully plain. Taste was still ok. Then our masala chicken was white meat when we distinctly requested for chicken leg. The assistant manager said we never informed him and went away mumbling to himself to replace the dish. The chicken was tough and not as good as usual.  He started plopping vegetables on our plates without saying what they were. When we discovered it was bitter gourd (I do not eat it) and requested for more of the other vegetables, he said no and that we should have told him before he served the bitter gourd. How would we know it was that when he never told us what the vegetable was. Usually the vegetable served was not bitter gourd.  And the pappadum was so miserable. I had never seen such a small portion before.  Then the assistant manager came back after we were done with our food asking if we wanted more vegetables.  It just kinda ruined the whole dining experience."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",5,5-Mar-23,Visiting on business and staying at the Hilton Garden Inn. Literally 1 minute walk. The lamb shank is very good. Had it twice in 2 weeks. Friendly staff and very willing to help you with descriptions. Lady Fingers are ocra in case you don't know. Ask for reduced spices and heat if you are not use to it. Always a good meal
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",5,21-Mar-17,"Impressive.  Yes, Anthony Bourdain's segment brought me here. Yes I half expected a tourist trap selling fish head curry but instead found an authentic Indian restaurant packed with locals. Bowls filled with spice laden curries and stews and the air, thick with aromatic spices. A frenetic energy throughout.  Since 1974 Banana Leaf has been dishing out Indian favorites. The banana leaf is the ""plate"" and it is not uncommon for guest to dine entirely with their fingers (use your right hand ONLY) though a spoon and fork are provided for those uncomfortable or unable to finger their foods.  Chicken Tikka, deeply marinated in kefir lime leaves, mint, cinnamon, cumin, turmeric, cardamom, ginger, and other spices is cooked in the tandoor until fall apart tender yet remaining wildly juicy (try that with a normal chicken breast). A side of herbaceous mint chutney only increases the flavor.  Spicy, moist chunks of fish are cooked in blend of spices, so generous, the spices alone thicken the ""sauce"". The garam masala spice blends flavor is incrredible. A splash of fermented fish sauce adds complexity and depth.  Need carbs? The Apolo Mutton Dum Biryani is outstanding. A signature dish, it features deeply flavored, turmeric supercharged basmati rice cooked with cubes of tender, not gamey mutton. Yogurt and a fiery fruit based chutney become it's perfect accompaniment.  Finally the mops, tandoor roti (layered, denser, whole wheat bread) and naan (fluffy, leavened, toothsome refined flour bread), both cooked in the tandoor near perfect.  An incredible mango lassi (more like pure mango puree with yogurt) extinguishes any heat and makes for a satisfying conclusion to the meal.  Proud of one's fingering technique and properly full, a meal that leaves you satisfied and oddly ready to return to the sweltering Singaporean heat."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,19-Feb-17,"Situated in a place called Little , Indeed, this place is legit. Fish head curry is their specialty and they have the accolade to back it up. If you are intimidated , ask for fillet fish curry, they have it too. Of course they have the traditional chicken tandoori, masala, peppered chicken and other Indian cuisine.All are pleasing to the palate. The condiments and rice will be serve on a banana . A must try restaurant when in Singapore."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,27-Sep-18,"We were visiting Little India in Singapore. The Banana Leaf Apolo was hopping during lunch time so we decided to patronize the restaurant.  We started with Peshawari Naan- Flat bread stuffed with dry nuts and raisins. Good Naan bread but the portion was very skimpy for the price. One thin Naan bread for Singapore 5 dollars.  The rest of the meal included:  Prawn Mango Curry.  Fish Tikka - marinated fish cubes in tandoor pot and served with mint chutney.  South Indian Vegetarian Meal - set lunch served with white rice and three vegetables - We wanted to share a variety of Veg items while sharing a serving of rice.  All the dishes were basically good. Aside from the Vegetarian meal, the portions were disappointingly small however.   The South Indian Vegetarian meal was a good value. The rest of the food we ordered were not."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,1-Oct-15,"I was warned by a local that this is somewhat tourist trap or ""Little India"" newbie's place. But so what!? My overall experience was quite good here. I came out with full stomach and big grin on my face.  Chicken tikka was nice and juicy, mutton biryanis was flavorful as I expected and its lamb wasn't too dry. Not sure which curry I had(because I let my friend make her 'executive decisions') but it was rather sweet than spicy. It was so sweet that I can consider it a desert!! But don't get me wrong. I really enjoyed the curry.  Good came out fast and hot which I find it rare in Singapore. LOL  That alone deserves 4 stars."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",1,16-Nov-19,"I asked for an allergen menu and they said there isn't any. The manager came over and said ""if you want to be 100 sure it's dairy free, you should stay at home""!!! Nice attitude for a restaurant. I will not be returning where I'm told to stay home. Their competitor down a block apparently wants my business enough to make an effort. I'm going back there next time. As for the food, I got the South Indian vegetarian thali because it was apparently the safest bet. Taste: Average at best, eggplant was barely cooked, no accompanying mango pickle or fried chili. Companions said the fish curry was very good."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",5,25-May-22,Probably the best Indian food I have had. The Chicken Tikka is a must try as well as the butter chicken.
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",3,16-Oct-16,"Banana Leaf Apolo Restaurant, a name synonymous with Indian Cuisine. It's been years since I came to this restaurant and despite stiff competition surrounding it, the restaurant, was absolutely buzzing.  Our relatives got there around 6.15pm. Seeing it was empty, they decided to walk around to explore the surrounding restaurants and when we returned at 6.40pm, the restaurant was 70% full. By 7.00pm, the restaurant was packed to capacity and a queue had starting forming.  The question is.... Is the food really that good? Or do people only come to banana leaf for the name.  Fish Tikka ($19.00) Pretty expensive as far as fish tikkas go. At $19, it's certainly one of if not the most expensive Fish Tikka I've had. The Tadoor seasoning, while coloring the fish beautifully, lacked that aromatic Tandoor spice, while the fish itself was overcooked and dry. Very disappointing.  Murgh Malai Kebab ($15.00) The dish was amazing...on the menu. Marinated in yogurt, malai (cream) and cheese, the dish was meant to be succulent, juicy and bursting with flavor. Unfortunately, it was neither. The chicken was dry, tough and neither the yogurt or the spices shone through. It tasted like a very one dimensional dish which never really got the palette excited and I found myself struggling with a single piece, often drowning it with the mint sauce to mask the chalkiness of the chicken.  Butter Chicken ($16.00) Average.... Very very average. Chicken pieces was again overcooked and a little dry while the sauce lacked the richness you expect from a butter chicken. While you could still taste the spices used and the sweetness from the onions, it tasted like a watered down version and severely lacked the intensity or boldness that is usually associated with a good butter chicken.  Mutton Briyani U fortunately, I can't give a price for this dish or actually highlight which mutton dish it was served with. Mutton Briyani or dum briyani is only served during lunch. When we ordered it for dinner, it came with Briyani rice for everyone and a bowl of what tasted and look like Mutton Masala.  However, the braised cabbage and bittergourd it came with was excellent and wonderfully cooked (although the bittergourd isn't for the faint hearted) and the rice was fragrant and fluffy.  The mutton.... The mutton had to be one of the best well cooked mutton dishes I've ever had. I'll be honest, the sauce was average, tasty but nothing to shout about but the cook of the mutton was perfect. tender and perfectly braised, the mutton had absorb the flavors of the spices wonderfully. Would have been a much better dish had the sauce had more depth and punch.  Fish Head Curry ($38.00 - Large) As compared to the Chinese versions, this is quite a steal, with a WHOLE fish head being served. And it was huge! This had to be the best dish of the night. The curry was light and very fragrant, not overpowering the natural sweetness from the fish while tomatoes and pineapples added a nice sweet / sour twist to the dish. The fish head curry here tasted like an evolution of the 3 common fish head curries we find in Singapore. The curry was smooth and contained a little coconut milk (Chinese), yes was light and slightly tangy although not as strong as the Assam versions (Malay) and had the fragrance and flavors from the spices used (Indian). The head itself had a lot of meat... A LOT. It was perfectly cooked too, moist and flaking off the bones perfectly. A very well executed dish that helped whet the palette.  Garlic Naan The dough was very good. There was a tinge of sweetness which complemented the pungent garlic well but, we wished it was serves fresher. By the time it got to us it tasted like it's been left out for a while before serving.  Drinks. The Lassi and Mango Lassi here were both very very good. The Teh Tarik felt a little light to me but the Masala tea was excellent  Overall the food was average, with exception to the fish head curry, which was the saving grace of the meal. Food needed a bit more care and just that little bit more flavor and the staff could certainly be friendlier too."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",1,26-Feb-19,"I'd rate this restaurant a 3-star, but the banana leaf was very dirty. I wiped it with a wet towel and it the towel looked very dirty. So they don't even wash nor wipe those banana leaves that they put on the plate to serve food on. I discarded the leaf and wipe the plate clean to hold my food instead.  Food was above average at best, but not enough for me to want more. When I crave Indian food, I would not think of Banana Leaf"
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",1,6-Mar-18,Upsell game was on full force at this tourist trap.  We came a little before noon and only the large size fish head curry was available?! The vegetable biryani was not shareable?! I laughed at the waiter's face. The food was okay overall but not memorable...except the free papadum. Is that even something I can legitimately review on? It's like saying the free dinner rolls at an Italian restaurant was the best part of the meal.  I was disappointed to have spent my money here.
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,22-May-18,"Delicious but a little confusing if you're not from around here. The chicken Tikka Masala has the perfect amount of sauce and wasn't too spicy. The garlic naan had loads of garlic, so the butter naan was perfect in taste. The mango lassi drink was delicious and I could drink gallons of that all day! What was confusing about this visit was when we ordered rice for the table, on one person received a large spoon serving of it on their plate. We, at the table (4 out of 5 of us) were confused or thought it was a joke that only one person received a serving of the rice. After that, we were guessing that maybe he order was per person. Without making another few orders of rice, we just shared from that person's plate which was just enough for all of us. Good Indian food recommended by the internet of top places to eat in Little India in Singapore."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",3,19-Oct-18,"Slow food, Nan 2$ each. Good draft tiger beer in pitcher and the adventure begins on a banana leaf for your plate.  Tip: go up to kitchen counter and see the food before you order."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",5,10-Nov-19,"Excellent Indian food!!! We had several dishes: Apollo spicy chicken, fried fish, prawn curry with mangoes and paneer makhani. You have a wide variety of Indian specialities. All the dishes were freshly cooked and quickly served. Service was very friendly. I also recommend the fresh watermelon and lime juice. The price is a bit higher than other restaurants. But it's definitely worth it."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,19-Nov-17,"Authentic southern Indian cuisine at this restaurant in the little India neighborhood of Singapore. Food is served on banana leaf covered plates. We tried the fish head soup, lamb masala, chicken 65, and chili prawns. The chicken was a bit dry but all the other dishes were quite good. Fish head soup is a popular choice here - almost every table near us had ordered it. Overall, a great southern Indian food experience with attentive and friendly service."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,31-Oct-15,"This place is somewhat of a tourist trap and there are other banana leaf joints for Indian food in Little India. Overall though, it was not bad.  You eat on a banana leaf. They dump some sides on your plate. The fish head curry wasn't as amazing as all the hype was about. Spicy but not enough flavor? Small size was pretty big for two people. Somewhat disappointed.  The Masala Prawns were good.  The butter chicken was just okay.  They have many locations so it's not bad if you want a quick Indian fix."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,8-Apr-17,"The Banana Leaf Apolo never disappoints. After a disappointing meal at Muthu's Curry the week before, I just had to make a trip to the Banana Leaf Apolo. Things have changed since my last trip here. We now place our orders on the iPad. To be honest I miss the old system although it's more convenient now. I ordered my usual - fish cutlets, apolo chicken biryani set - comes with two veges and I love the masala on this chicken, fish curry and mango lassi. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS and sooo satisfying. And let me reiterate what the other reviews said - this is NOT a tourist trap. I've been coming here for years and it's always on my list when I go home. Sure, there are plenty of places that you can eat for under $10 but good food is good food, and there's only one Banana Leaf Apolo."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",3,30-Oct-14,"This place was always the ""GO TO"" place for me and my parents whenever we felt like some South Indian food since I was young! (This place has been here for quite awhile indeed!)  This place sets the standard for a wholesome Indian dining experience, both foodwise as well as the dining environment.  If you're looking for something ""upscale"" or of posh restaurant feel that you can impress your date with then I have to say look elsewhere NOW! But if you're looking to have a comfortable time and not having to mind the volume of laughter and voice levels of yours or others, eating in a very long communal table with your hands (optional) along with strangers, this may very well be the place for you!  Many tourists and locals alike come here for dinner indulging in their famous curry fish heads where caucasian tourists seem very amused with! Their menu is extensive and food quantities are huge!  Everything on the menu is tasty! From the Northern Indian Tandoori Chickens, to their yummy butter chicken, chicken 65, naans, free flow of rice and vegetable sets... the tasty list goes on and on!  Prices are reasonable and while there are many other places to go where the food and environment may be even nicer, like I mentioned, this place definitely sets the standard where indian food should at least be! Definitely still a ""GO TO"" place if you're visiting Singapore and feeling like some hearty indian food without extremely hurting your wallet in a mediocre indian food place in let's say, hmmm.. somewhere like MBS perhaps? :P  P.S - Service can be a bit iffy at times although there seems to be many staff pacing around, so my advice is try to remember ordering all your stuff the first time round so you dont have to try to get the attention of the workers walking around so fast and ""missing you out"". Ask for the extra ice waters to come first, more veg/rice if you need while they dish it out for you, that extra small free bowl of fish curry you wanna dip your papadums in all the first time round - then sit back, relax and watch them all come!  3.9 Stars"
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",5,17-Dec-17,This is probably my favorite Indian food in Singapore. They serve great curry fish head.
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,18-Sep-17,"I had the vegetarian south Indian thali and I must say I was one of the best meal I had. It contains sambhar, rasam, daal, raita and curd with good amount. Also you can ask for more rice if you want.  At the end you will get Gulab Jamun which was utterly delicious."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,22-Nov-14,"Felt like eating back home - Tamil Nadu, India. - Eating in Banana Leaf is wow. Missing home!  Sambar for after noon lunch was fantastic and i repeated again and had few.  Rasam could have been bit spicy with more tomato taste.  Vegetables they served is excellent and cooked well.  Payasam - is not that great, they should work on it, too much of kesar powder in it.  Ambiance is good and I see lots enjoying the food and Indian Tender Coconut water never thought they will provide like this. - in One word - Fantastic.  Will come back here soon with my Dad and he will definitely enjoy!"
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,30-Apr-17,"We had to try this place after reading so much about it. I went with a big group on a weekend. We had reservations, which is a must, as it gets VERY busy. The waiter even told us that they kick people out if they're even 5 minutes late to their reservation...  We got the fish curry and biryani. The process of ordering is a little confusing, and I wish our waiter had explained to us how it works. If you order Biryani, the rice comes separately. This is something I've never encountered before, so I was very confused when a bowl of just mutton and sauce arrived. Nonetheless, the biryani was fantastic! Well spiced and the meat was tender.  The fish curry was a very generous size and fantastic as well. Lots of tender meat and spicy curry.  Overall, the place lives up to its name, however it can get pretty chaotic during busy times."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,13-Jul-13,"This is a review of a dinner with a friend at The Banana Leaf Apolo on Race Course Road.  This is the second Banana Leaf Apolo I've visited. I've also been to and reviewed the one on Serangoon Rd. The experience at the Race Course Road outlet was similar but not exact. I actually consider it slightly better.  Quick comparison between the two - The Race Course Road outlet was much busier. I like this. It makes a meal feel more like an event. The ambiance, while not upscale, at Race Course Road did not feel as much like a food court. Overall, I would also give a slight nod to my enjoyment of the food there. The samosas were completely different. The Serangoon outlet serves smaller ones. I prefer the larger style offered at the Race Course shop.  The ambiance is pretty basic. There are some art accents on the walls. There was a muted television. The tables and chairs are very basic and functional. They are also packed in. If you are a smaller group, you can expect that you will be sitting very close to another group. This is not a place for a romantic date or arranging illicit business deals. While we were there, they were taking full advantage of all that packed in seating. The restaurant was hopping.  http://tinyurl.com/qexq2by  The service is based on efficiency. They have a lot of staff on hand. I think the goal is to get your order, bring your food, and get you out the door as quickly as possible. Don't get me wrong, the staff is not rude. But there are no pleasantries. We were quickly seated. Our order was taken soon after. Right after that, the rice and some condiments were placed on our banana leafs. Before we could say, ""bring us some great Indian food"" the remainder of our meal starting flowing onto our ""almost too small to hold it all"" table.   A note: There is always a lot made of eating with your hands at Banana Leaf Apolo. I did not see anyone eating with their hands at either shop. I've actually seen this a lot more at some other Indian restaurants I've visited. At both outlets, we were provided with forks and spoons.  The food ranged from good to very good. One note, none of the food was very hot. It was all kind of warm. This did slightly detract from my enjoyment of some of the dishes.  Dinner Collage:  http://tinyurl.com/pa5hm3u  Vegetable Samosa - This was a good samosa. It ticked off the basic boxes. It was crisp on the outside. It was tender and flavourful on the inside. However, as samosas go, it did not really stand out.  http://tinyurl.com/otaqazr  Gobi 65 - This is a cauliflower starter. It is fried cauliflower with a ginger and chilli sauce. I expected it to have more spicy zip. The cauliflower was almost perfectly cooked and their was a nice balance of flavours. This dish would also have been better if it had been hotter. When it was brought to the table, it was luke warm. I still enjoyed it though.  http://tinyurl.com/ngvc8k2  Chilli Fish - First, the fish was perfectly cooked. It was tender and flaky. The flavour of the fish was very delicate. This is another dish that I expected to have more kick to it. After all, there is chilli right there in the name. But, it was actually a very mild dish. I enjoyed it. Out of all the dishes, this is the one that had that just prepared taste to it. I would not hesitate to order it again.  http://tinyurl.com/oskosh3  Aloo Gobi Mattar - Aloo Gobi has truly became one of my mainstays of an Indian meal. This has only really developed in the last year. This was a nice rendition of the dish. The cauliflower and potatoes were cooked well. They each still had a nice ""bite"" to them. The sauce was flavourful. The portion was generous. This is another dish though that would have benefited from being served a little hotter.  http://tinyurl.com/o5owlas  Butter Chicken - This was a pretty standard butter chicken. It was creamy. The chicken was tender. It was rich and yes, buttery.  http://tinyurl.com/qjhebur  Receipt (Dinner for 2): $68.48  http://tinyurl.com/py5yj7m  Overall - This was a enjoyable Indian dining experience. The ambiance and service are both based on function and efficiency. The restaurant has a nice buzz because it is full of people enjoying their tasty Indian food. The food had some inconsistencies but overall was well prepared and flavourful. They could improve by serving their food at a slightly higher temperature. I also wouldn't mind a little more spicy zip, where applicable. As with the other Banana Leaf, I am doing a little rounding up to get to the fourth star."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",5,25-Nov-17,"The hype is true! Their fish head curry is absolutely delicious and a MUST! Curry is tomato based and slightly spicy, with okra, pineapples, and tomatoes for texture. Had it with biryani rice and we demolished everything. Mango lassi is really good too. Service is super fast. One of the best restaurants I've eaten in Singapore so far!"
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",5,22-Jan-19,"Great food! If you're looking for Indian food, this is it. On my trip to Asia, tumble on this place through Yelp app. The food is delicious no matter what your choices are. You won't be disappointed."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,21-May-18,"This place was awesome! Food was very delicious , and our server was so friendly . It was my families first Indian dining experience so they had many questions but our server was so patient and gave us many recommendations without trying to upsell too much . We loved everything we ate: Sheep, kehbab , chicken tandoori, chicken curry, garlic naan and yogurt , and veggie biryani rice was fantastic. Only thing was that it was extremely spicy , I was sweating . but if u like that then can be 5 star worthy. We wanted to try to chili crab but it was quite pricy $40 a crab ."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",5,21-Apr-15,"This place is featured on all the travel programmes for a reason - the fish head curry is fantastic! It's nothing like a typical Northern Indian curry...although it does use the typical curry spices (curry leaf, cumin, garlic, chili), it also uses South Indian spices such as tamarind, pineapple, ginger and lime leaves, which give it a sweet-and-sour flavour. I don't know what species the fish heads are, but they're delicious. A ""small"" portion is more than enough for one person. The meat falls off the bones and is superbly tender. You get rice for free, but I paid extra for an order of plain naan to sop up the sauce and I think I made the right choice.  Bring hospital gloves: the sauce does stain your fingers, and if you have a hangnail or a paper cut and the hot sauce gets in it, it hurts like no one's business.  The place is always crowded and there can be a wait out the door, but the staff are good about turning tables around quickly."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",5,18-Nov-14,"Beforehand you should know: a free table on a weekend day is like winning the lottery, because The Banana Leaf Apolo is often hopelessly crowded and does not really appear romantically charming, as the arrangement of the tables kind of make you feel like visiting a canteen. If you have however managed to get a table, a visit to this restaurant with its northern Indian cuisine is the absolute jackpot. In the back of the restaurant you will find the daily offered displayed in a glass cabinet. It's damn hard to make a decision and you will even receive an additional menu at the table. Heaven help! The restaurant is above all famous for their signature dich: fish head curry, slowly cooked in a curry based spicy sauce. If you are lucky and finally made up your mind, you can order the main dishes at the table. Sides, such as rice and vegetables will be refilled ""automatically"". The waiters will come in regular intervals, carrying large pots with yummy treats asking you, if you would like another serving. Oh happy land of milk and honey! The food literally swept me off my feet. Granted, I have never been a huge fan of Indian cuisine. So accordingly, I did not have high expectations. But: the flavors that my taste buds may experience today, would even exceed the highest expectations. The spicy grilled mutton is provided with a touch of cinnamon. The squid is buttery soft and simply melts in your mouth. I can taste a vast number of different spices that unify to an outstanding taste experience."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",5,16-Aug-14,"This is by far one of the best Indian food restaurants I've ever been to. I had the chicken Tikka, briyani with prawns, and my sweetheart had the Lamb Coconut fry. We also shared some garlic Naan and garlic with onion kulcha. This is a must try restaurant, you won't be disappointed with the good food, and the service is also very good. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to enjoy a real Indian cuisine! Oh, a really cool thing is that you are actually going to eat on a banana leaf. Love this place!"
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",3,6-Jul-17,"The food is great! I love the spices. However, I feel like the service can be improved... when we sat down to order our food, there were a lot of firm instructions given as to where we can put our bags, that we are not allowed to share our rice portions and we could not keep a menu with us at the table because there were not enough, but hardly half of the restaurant was filled! Would appreciate better service next time since we do pay for service charge!"
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",5,17-Jul-17,"Very tasty. I had the finger lady (okra) curry and husband had butter chicken with rice and vegetables. No disappointments (except for the $2/bottle of water already on the table which I wouldn't have opened had I known). Flavour, service, atmosphere, service and food section were all great, would definitely go back if in little India. Yum and yum."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",5,19-Aug-16,"Amazing food, fast delivery even when restaurant is full. Service need to be improved but overall was OK."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",5,23-Nov-15,"We had fish head curry L, big portion. My husband loved it a lot, I thought it was good, but craved some tikka masala. The food came with free papatam (on an oily side). Rice, veggie and cabbage for extra 6 dollars for two."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,3-Jan-15,"I was told that it is one of the best Indian food restaurant in town. So I came here and ordered a set lunch. I love how they server you food on a piece of banana leaf. I didn't know you should use your hand to eat the food to get the most out of your meal but being the tourist that I am, I asked for utensils. :) The curries and all sides were amazing. Rich layered flavors! The staffs are extremely attentive. This place is delicious and you must try it if you ever get a chance to visit Singapore!"
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",1,17-May-18,Dining experience from hell! Chomped onto a SCREW in the cauliflower dish we ordered which chipped the crown of my tooth. Management did not seem at all worried and thought they were doing me a favour by taking that dish off the bill! Dental bill $184!!!
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,5-Oct-14,"Sri Lanka crab is the best. Fish head curry is just ok. To me, it is a little bit sour. We love the food here. Nice and fast service."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,18-Feb-17,"Yes, get the Fish Head Curry. We over-ordered our side dishes, but all was tasty. It may be a bit touristy, but there seemed to be a hopping local lunch business when we were there. I'd go back."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",5,4-Oct-14,"Delicious, authentic food. There is a reason why so many locals eat here. Every time I visit singapore this place is on my list of restaurants to dine at. You will become a repeat customer too and that is not a bad thing."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",4,30-Apr-14,"it's pricy for indian food.. but you come here for their famed fish head curry.. my wife thought it was too spicy but i enjoyed the flavor and the heat.. the other stuff (e.g. biryani, naan, vegetable entrees) were also excellent..  service can be a bit lackadaisical..  definitely come in a group so you can try everything.."
The Banana Leaf Apolo,3.9,49,"Indian, Asian Fusion",1,14-Mar-15,"Total tourist trap. Avoid. Decent food because it's hard not to get good Indian food in little India but not spectacular. I couldn't figure out why this place was packed. Briyani was disappointment. Just yellow rice, not even flavored. Fish curry was good. Mutton curry was good. Small portions. $100 for 5 of us for lunch and ordered fish curry, mutton curry, fried okra, and drinks. Decent Indian food but a rip off for where u are. Would be better to pay a lil more and step it up to Muthus if ur gonna pay that much. Or if ur just about the chow, head over to Tekka food centre down the street for way better food at a fraction of the cost."

Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,8-Jun-24,"Probably one of the better chicken rice we had during our trip in Singapore.  It is a bit overhyped - but I trust you, Chef! The rice was soft and fragrant... the chicken was smooth and tender... the sauce was a bit too light but still quite delicious.

Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,4-Jun-24,"QUICKIE REVIEW Anthony Bourdain signed off on it. Just on you to try it  FOOD This is what I tried: Steamed chicken and rice  For me, the chicken was ok. However, the RICE was full of flavor. I could eat a whole plate of that stuff by itself.   PARKING No.  SERVICE Order at stall, pick up at stall.  PRICE Around $8.  TIP/OTHER THOUGHTS I would be interested to have this again but with roasted chicken to see if the taste is any different."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,1-Jun-24,A total disappointment if there ever was one. Service is pretty quick for a hawker stall and they worked out a great system. I was probably the 10th person in line and only had to wait just under 10 minutes before it was my turn to order. Because of the notoriety of the hawker center and some of the hawkers themselves it was hot and crowded.  I ordered the medium size single meal with a side of baby bok Choy worth oyster sauce. Honestly the vegetables were a lot bigger the than the chicken in terms of serving size. The chicken itself was not too impressive as the breast meat was relatively dry while the dark meat was rather succulent. The chicken broth that comes with it tasted like all the other broths I have ever tried. The rice was also on par with some other places. The sauce that was poured over the chicken was sweet and savory and helped as a nice flavor to the meal. The vegetables were tasty thanks to the oyster sauce but I still hate it when they cut baby bok choy lengthwise. Having the vegetables felt healthy.  Note that I have tried Tian Tian I will try to find some time to try its rival which is located a few stalls down. Maybe the sheer volume of customers does not help in maintaining a high standard of quality in the food.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,19-Apr-24,"Located in Maxwell Centre, this is a popular hainan chicken rice food stall and you can expect long lines. I was excited to give them a try, but thought it was okay - not the best I've had.  The Hainan Chicken rice portion is decent and the flavors were decent. The price is a little more expensive than the other food stalls in the hawker center and there were a bit stingy with the orange sauce.  Overall, I was glad to give them a try, but I've had better Hainan Chicken Rice. Therefore, they're not a spot I would need to revisit."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,18-Jan-24,"The hype is real. I finally got to try this popular Hainanese chicken and rice place back in November 2023. I was also here in February 2018, but the stall was closed during my visit that time - probably because of Chinese New Year celebration and I don't know TBH.  We got and shared the medium sized chicken and rice dish. The chicken was moist and juicy. The rice was flavorful and perfectly cooked. The food was so delicious. Btw, this place is cash only.  I'll make sure that we'll come back again one day during our visit to Singapore."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,3-Feb-24,Chicken rice (m): Oo this was goood. The rice is fragrant with a slight coconut flavor. The chicken is so juicy and flavorful. The sauce on top adds to the chicken flavor. The orange sauce was coconutty and refreshing but also spicy. One issue was mine had a lot of bones though. 4.5/5
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,14-Nov-23,"If I was blind tasting this dish alone it would be a five star experience no doubt! The chicken is unbelievably silky and the rice has delicious flavor. The hot sauce provided also really enhances the flavor profile and provides some lingering heat to make each bite fun.  The reason it is not five stars is because of the little bit of service that was provided was a little rude to be frank. First the lady trying to take orders kept arguing with someone in the back every time she asked what I wanted so it took like 3 tries. Then upon turning over my ticket to get my order fulfilled, I tried to grab a tray and it was unceremoniously slapped down from my hands by the staff again. Ok, sure I guess I didn't really need one but that was also unnecessary to hit it down from me.  Can't help but think popularity has gotten to their head a bit. They are the one stall that has a special queue inside Maxwell after all.  Still, delicious food and great value. SGD 6 for my medium plate."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,17-Dec-23,"Such a Singapore staple and a must visit on your visit to Singapore! I come to Maxwell Food Centre just for Tian Tian and each time, it's better than the last. Pro-tip: get the chicken drumstick as the dark meat is the best! I always get the drumstick which is boneless and cut just like the breast and a side of chicken rice. It's the perfect combo.  Come early as the line always forms quickly but service is fast and efficient. There's a reason why this spot has become famous over the years!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,30-Nov-22,"Yum! We had to stop by Tian Tian Chicken Rice on our recent trip to Singapore. This location is in the Maxwell Food Centre and it's easy to spot this hawker stall as there's always a line outside even when we came pretty early in the day.  We only waited about 5 minutes and ended up getting half a chicken with half traditional hainanese chicken and half soy sauce chicken as we wanted to taste the combo and it only comes in a half chicken portion. Was about 16 Singaporean dollars for the meal.  The chicken is tender and soft and great with the gravy that they pour on top. The real star of the show was the rice. Super fragrant and packed with a ton of flavor, you can eat the rice by itself and I'd say it's better than the chicken. If I went back I would order less chicken and another bowl rice as one was too little to share with another person."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,13-Apr-24,"I got to the stall just before noon and queued for a few minutes (definitely get there early, as the queue doubled by the time I was done). The chicken rice was simple but so well-made. The rice had lots of flavor and wasn't overcooked, and the chicken was also pretty juicy (watch out for the bones though). Seating can be hard to find in this center, as a heads up."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,6-Oct-23,"Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice was on my list of places to eat while in Singapore. It's located in the Maxwell Food Centre and is one of many chicken & rice stands found in Singapore. Not only is it a Michelin Bib Gourmand recognized food stand, it's also a spot where Anthony Bourdain frequented when he visited Singapore. We arrived after the lunch rush were the line was short. My husband grabbed a table while I went to order. I ordered the regular chicken rice for us to share, since I wasn't sure if we wanted to eat more elsewhere or not. They had utensils next to the trays. You queue up, pay in cash when you order, get your ticket, give your ticket to the pick-up window, and go sit down. It's pretty straight forward if you ask me.  The chicken is piled on top of the rice and the chili sauce is on the side. When they serve it to you, they pour the brown sauce over the chicken and rice. I kind of wish they had given me more of that chili sauce because it really elevated the dish. The chicken was moist and the rice was flavorful. I was super happy with the dish. There's nothing more comforting than chicken & rice to me. My husband and I gobbled it up and we loved it so much, we went back for a second plate. So, I got back in line and paid for another plate. It was one of my favorite meals in Singapore to date. One thing to note, you need to bring your own napkins or tissues because they don't offer any to customers. Bring your own water bottle or pay for drinks at nearby stands. You and always wash your hands at the nearby restrooms."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,2-Apr-24,"Hainanese chicken rice here is legit. There's always a line but it goes pretty quickly, and the ambiance is entirely appropriate for a hawker centre. They have competitors just a few stalls down but Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice clearly gets all the attention.  If you're not coming often go splurge on the large, it's not that much more."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,5-Jul-23,"We wanted to try this place as it was always crowded. I arrived at 1:30pm and there was a line up to the back of the food court. The line moved quick and I waited in line for about 10 mins.  Steamed chicken rice (Large): the chicken was tender and the flavor was ok. The soy sauce was a delicious compliment to the chicken. The rice was my favorite part: succulent, flavorful and cooked perfectly. The sambal was delicious too. I wish that I could try the roasted version one as it was sold out. It was 3.5 stars for my liking."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,19-Feb-24,"It's strictly ok to me  I understand... this is nostalgic for people in singapore. But for me, this was basic and didn't have much redeeming value.  Did a side by side of tian tian and ah tai hainanese chicken.  I'm going to copy and paste this same review for Tian tian and ah tai.  Tian tian: long wait (this is where the out the door line is). It moves fast but you also have to be pushy. The sauce had move flavor, and the chicken was more tender. Everything else was the same  Ah tai: shorter wait, nicer people. The broth they added on the side was delicious. The chicken itself had more ginger flavor and was still very tender and moist.  If I had my choice, I'd go be to ah tai because the broth is an added bonus, and the line is shorter."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,3-Dec-23,"The first thing I got at Maxwell Food Centre was the hainan chicken from here. Luckily, there was no one when I went at 5pm, but the cashier was still adamant I stood in the rope where the line would've been --weird. Anyways, got one medium order of the Hainan Chicken with Rice (SG$6). The chicken is silky and rice has a nice garlic aroma, great dish! I'm not used to the gravy that they push on this, so I've had better in my opinion. Overall, still a solid hainan chicken dish though."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,27-Dec-23,"This place is a very well-known Hainanese Chicken Rice place, there are probably several really good places to get that in Singapore and at different Hawker Centers, but my wife and I decided to go with the well known one, which had a long line but the line moved quickly.  We split one medium chicken rice, because there's plenty of food places in the hawker center and we didn't want to get full off of one item.  We ordered a medium chicken rice and plate of veggies, all for a fraction of what we pay for back home in California.  There was plenty of seating in the food center, you need to bus your own trays."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,27-Dec-23,"I am not usually a fan of Hainanese Chicken dish but this was so good! I would recommend trying it. The chicken was juicy, the sauce was flavorful without being over powering. If you like to eat spicy, ask for an additional hot sauce container. One of the best dish I ate in Singapore. We heard the line can get long but we got lucky and didnt have to wait for more than 10 mins"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,22-Dec-23,"This place was delicious - amazing food if you don't have to wait too long. Best chicken rice ever!  We visited on a Thu lunch period and got a large chicken rice and small veggies to share with 2 people. Would recommend this for one person but pro tip would be to get chicken by itself (half chicken for 2-3 people, full for more), then rice, then veggies. Chicken rice set doesn't have veggies in it - just chicken and rice.  The chicken itself is really soft and flavorful - the soy sauce on top is enough but the side sauce that they give is nice too if you want an extra spicy kick. The rice has a rich chicken flavor.  Have heard that it can be an hour wait sometimes, but with a line out the door and maybe 10 people deep, it moved pretty quickly and we ordered and got our food within 15 mins."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,13-Dec-23,"This place is good but a little bit overhyped. There is a better chicken rice place right under the same roof. It's good, but I don't think the line is justified."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,3-Dec-23,"A hyped-up Hainanese Chicken Rice stall in Maxwell Hawker Center. I recommend lining up before the lunch rush, so sometime before noon (it opens at 10am I believe). While this is good chicken rice, I wouldn't say it was mindblowing or super different than a different chicken rice stall. In fact, it was a bit inconsistent, as we ordered 3, and 2 of the 3 were a ton of bones while the 3rd plate had no bones (was white/breast meat), so some chicken plates get more meat than others). The rice is well flavored and the chili sauce is good. For the price, comparing to what you can get in the States, it's a great deal. Although I agree with some of the reviews that it's overhyped, and it's good to try with minimal wait, but definitely be sure to try out other chicken rice places while in Singapore to decide and compare for yourself."

Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,7-Feb-23,"A Michelin Bib Gourmand, Tian Tian specializes in chicken rice and that's what everyone lines up for. If you have no idea where the stall is, just look for the one with the longest line. I mean this line went all the way out of the hawker center! Be smart about it and have just one person order for everyone while the rest look for more food and seating.  The chicken itself wasn't that impressive but the rice was so good. There was just so much flavor in every bite. Its doesn't look like much, but it's cheap!  I don't think it's worth the wait. You're better off trying other things if the line is crazy long."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,9-Dec-22,"Dropped by Maxwell Center on a Monday at around 7:30 PM and Tian Tian was already closed. Luckily, this hawker center was within walking distance from our hotel, so we tried again on a Wednesday at around 9:30. It was open and there was no line! Jackpot!  We ordered the large chicken rice and it was definitely the best Hainan chicken rice I've ever had. Granted, I've only ever had Hainan chicken rice at restaurants in the states, or making it myself at home (which is a pain to make), but still. The chicken was so tender and flavorful, and the rice was very fragrant. And the chili sauce...the chili sauce was *chef's kiss*. I would be happy just to eat the rice with the chili sauce and some cucumbers.  My only regret is not making a return trip to Tian Tian. Totally worth the hype. Just make sure you go early to avoid the lines (which seems like it can get pretty long since they have line posts for crowd control), and in case they sell out quickly."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,7-Jan-23,"I watched so many YouTube videos and made it one of the must stops this time in Singapore. It is located in the Maxwell Food Center - right across the street from the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple.  I came around 11:40 am and the line to order was super long. I was waiting for at least about 35 minutes to 45 minutes until I got to order.  My family and I ordered each a medium chicken and rice, a half chicken and a large bokchoy to share. About $60 total.  The chicken was so amazing... super tender and juicy. The rice was a little let down from what I expected but still decent.  One thing to note - not sure how many stood in line were locals?!? maybe more tourists ?! Since Anthony Bourdain came here before. There are some similar stalls selling the same dishes and the wait is much less.  We got our drinks at different stalls in the food center. Bring your own napkins or tissues as they are hard to find.  Overall it was a great visit! Definitely recommend if you are willing to wait for a bit!!!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,23-Jan-23,"I love Hainan chicken but there are so few places to get it back home, so of course we had to try this Michelin Bib Gourmand stall!  My favorite part was probably the rice which was super flavorful, but I didn't find the chicken to be anything special. I still think I prefer my favorite shop back home which has a delicious ginger sauce, but Tian Tian gives much larger portions for a fraction of the price.  You'll definitely be getting your money's worth by coming here so I think it's still worth stopping by!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,25-Nov-22,"Had to drop by Maxwell to see Tian Tian. Anticipation kept growing as I made my way thru the lunch rush line.  Strength in numbers. Have someone scout a table while another waits in line. Got my order quick and easy.  A medium order of Hainanese chicken rice will run you $6 SGD, although some may question whether the portion matches its described size.  It's all about the rice. Ridiculously flavorful, it definitely outshines the chicken. And because of that... it was underwhelming.  If you're from the SGV in SoCal, I would easily pick Tian Tian's rice, but take Cluck2Go's chicken and Savoy's sauces to make a superior dish."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,2-Sep-22,"Located in the Maxwell hawker center, this place is worth trying a plate of their chicken and rice. We knew this was a go-to place when we walked up and there was a line of 6 or 7 people waiting to order in front of this small stall.  The Rice is soaked, just INFUSED, with the chicken fat. The fat shines off your lips. Definitely tasting the stock in the rice. Although the chicken wasn't as flavorful as I'd hope, the spicy garlic orange paste makes up in flavor. The sauce here is spicier than the Ah Tai vendor 3 stalls down. I recommend ordering from both stalls and comparing!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,21-Jul-22,Surely representing the best hainanese chicken joint in Singapore as you can see line started at pre-opening.

The queue for this Michelin Bib Gourmand stall was ~10-15 minutes at 12:30 pm on a Sunday, except it was 85F outside or 97F after factoring humidity. Luckily Singaporeans queue and there was also a covered waiting area.  Prices have gone up drastically due to the chicken shortage from Malaysia.  Ordered the chicken thigh rice for $8, cash only. The rice was extremely fragrant, and the chicken was world class juicy. The sauce on top was just world class! The chili dipping sauce was quite spicy too!  There are additional tables behind the stalls, except there are no fans!"

The rice was also fragrant and the dish was complemented by a super flavorful gravy.  Seating is open in the hawker stall and there are plenty of fans in an attempt to keep everyone cool.

The hainan chicken was world class and very moist. ...despite requesting all dark meat, I found some white meat?!?  The rice was fragrant and the soup was decent, although a tad oily.  The most challenging part of the meal was the humid outdoor environment...

They are closed on Mondays so I came on a Sunday morning. Online said they opened at 1030 but I arrived around 10am and there was already a short line. Waited about 5 minutes - they are quite efficient. Medium sized chicken rice was S$6.00 (small S$5 and large ~S$8). Food was delicious and I loved the spicy sauce it came with as well. Don't think I would wait too long for this place, but glad I was able to try it!  They are CASH ONLY."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,4-Mar-24,"It is a must visit place, and I order the basic disk. I love their sauce, but the rice didn't taste any different than other. The chicken meat was smooth and clean. The line was long depending on the time on that day. The size of the disk is small comparing to American style of small. However, you don't want to order to big. So, you can try other disk. Overall good experience and taste. So, is it the best Hainanese chicken rice? Not for me. You can try and see thing go with your taste."

Obviously get the chicken rice (medium) - there's a star on the menu for most popular plate. The rice is super fragrant and delicious, more moist than I expected. Chicken is delicious as well - you may not even need any sauces.  Must come here!! And definitely try other stalls here as well - there's a nice juice and smoothie stall right next to here :)"

Really wonder has anyone really tried a good Chicken rice or just saw the queue and lined up to satisfy the superficial notion.  Really such a disappointment seeing such misleading ratings.

It was on Anthony Bourdains ""No Reservation"" and has a Michelin star & it's star dish - chicken rice ... comes in at a whopping total of $6 (Singapore dollars ... so even cheaper for USA). 3 different sizes depending on your hunger level, and I opted for the medium... however, I wish I got the large because it was just that good! The rice was ok, nothing spectacular, the sauce on top is what makes the flavor pop there but the chicken.. just wow. It is SO SO SO juicy and tender. I am literally googling how to cook any kind of chicken dinner in my future just like that. I dare say the best chicken I've had. Go, you won't be disappointed!"

I'm not sure if I can add anything else. Yes, Bourdain was here. As usual, he is right. This quintessential Singaporean dish of chicken and rice is so perfectly done that you can't find fault in it. Incredibly soft chicken, fragrant rice and the sauce is deliciously spiced with ginger puree. I ordered a large portion (S$8.80 for a large though?!) so I could get more chicken and got the soy egg for extra protein.  There wasn't a wait when I came in at 11am. The crowds came at lunch time when the surrounding office workers were out. I'm not one to stand in line for a long time and there are other chicken and rice stalls at Maxwell's which are probably worth a try too."

The rice with the chicken and the sauce (amazing) over the entire dish was literally *chef's kiss* I don't know how else to explain it. And it's super affordable. You can't get a dish like this for ~$3.50 USD back in the States....  Don't be scared by the line because it goes by pretty quickly. We went around the time they opened to avoid the line (which we did!!), but since we ordered seconds, we had to wait in line that time- but it did not take long!

Actually, I cannot really say that my mom ever cooked this dish... but if she had, then it still would not have compared. Tian Tian's chicken rice dish truly lives up to the legend it has become!  There are enough reviews detailing the deliciousness and tenderness of this dish, so I will provide you with a pro tip - the line here can get long quickly, so plan to stop in at an off-time (ya know, not during the typical lunch/dinner rush times).  I stopped in early on a Friday afternoon and walked right up and ordered - score! Shortly after I sat down to wait the brief wait for my order, the line grew ten-plus long in a snap.

I can't say that I'd go back here for this. Maybe the rice and the sauce were the best part. I did finish my dish tho. It wasn't bad or good. The price was outrageous for the half chicken rice. It was $16! I saw Anthony Bourdain's picture on the window. Yeah, that's why it was so expensive for what it is. I'd go to any other places in the Hawkers and pay $6 for the dish. I bet it would taste the same."

Tian Tian, recommended by the concierge at the Ritz-Carlton, was the first stop on my quest.  Tian Tian is located at the Maxwell Food Centre, a short walk from Marina Bay. Don't be alarmed at the long line. It moves quickly!  We ordered a medium chicken rice to share (but came back again the next day and ordered our own), which set us back 5 Singapore dollars ($3.69 USD). A total steal for lunch.  What makes this place so special is that they do a simple dish really well: - the chicken is perfectly poached, soft & juicy - the rice is fragrant and tasty, not bland like at Hawker Chan - the chili sauce that comes with the dish is super tasty, there's chili, citrus (probably lime), a little bit of oil, a perfect topping for this chicken rice dish. I need to get the recipe for this chili sauce because I want to drizzle it on top of all my chicken rice meals.  If you are in Singapore, you MUST visit Tian Tian."

Score for no lines at a Michelin rated hawker stall!  Went ahead and ordered their specialty Hainam chicken dish. I thought it was good and what snt it apart, was the gravy sauce! You can't find this sauce anywhere and it is probably what gives this place the 1 Michelin Star rating.  After much thought, I think America has spoiled me in that theres so much options and similar to many of the famous hawker stall flavors here I in Singapore. I would defInitely recommend coming here to try the sauces Hainan Chicken if there's no ginormous line!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,13-Dec-19,"Born out of frugality and created by servant-class immigrants trying to stretch the flavor of the chicken, chicken rice dishes are a staple to Singaporean cuisine. I did the chicken rice challenge between Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice and Liao Fan Hawker Chan. The ever-so-popular Michelin Guide praised one with a single star, and the other was highlighted by a celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain (RIP).  In comparison, both prices were similar, and they both drew a crowd where the line can get pretty if arriving during peak hours. The most significant difference between these two stands was their style. One was soy sauce based, while the other was a stock-based.  If I had a vote between the two, purely based on my opinion, I would give my vote to this restaurant. I loved the texture and the temperature of the chicken. Served somewhat cold while trying to beat the humidity. Along with the meal, they served chicken broth and their house version of the hot sauce, which complements well when the chicken starts to taste plain. I loved this place for the price. Although it did not fill me up, it was enough for me to have the right amount of energy to start my day."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,23-Apr-19,Great hainan chicken and luckily we didn't have much of a wait!  Chicken was moist and rice was flavorful. A little more expensive than other options: 5 per chicken rice (medium size).

I've heard tons fo good feedback about Tian Tian's chicken and rice. Don't kill me for saying it, but it was so-so.. and I think that's because I sous-vide my chicken at home so I'm spoiled with super tender/moist poultry. That said I totally get for people who don't sous vide regularly, how this would be a mind blowing experience.  Super affordable, great with a Tiger beer; but didn't finish the plate thinking I needed to come back again."

This joint has 2 locations but I wanted to try the popular one that is located in the Maxwell food center.  Located on the opposite side of Maxwell ave of the hawker center, you will put your order in and grab a ticket. You'll then hand the ticket to the other window and they will serve you your food. The line can queue up depending on the time, especially during the lunch hour. However I showed up a little before 11:30 on a Tuesday and there was no wait!  Most popular is the medium chicken rice, which includes chicken the rice and the chili sauce all on a plate. Chicken was very moist and tender like what people said but the chili sauce is what makes it really good. I highly recommend that you give this place a try although it is not my personal favorite in Singapore"

The chicken was solid, relatvely tender & not too dry, skins & bone attached. Most of the chicken were good cuts with minimal unwanted parts. When served it already has a layer of light sauce on it, but they also privode you with a side of spicy dipping sauce. Again I wish they have that Cantonese style dipping sauce that has more minced ginger & slightly saltier. The rice was also good, cooked in the chicken's own juice. The vege was pretty good as well, lightly flavored & still relatively crunchy  Overall the place serves solid food, but I could barely distinguish it from the other good hainan chicken rice places."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,30-Apr-19,"I think this was a little overhyped for me unfortunately :( the chicken was quite bland. The rice was a little more fragrant, but I wasn't able to taste why this place was so special. It's quite a cheap Michelin starred place, and i've never had Hainanese chicken, so i have nothing to compare it to."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,30-Dec-18,"We had landed in Singapore early in the morning and wasn't able to check in yet. So we decided to take the bus to the Maxwell Hawker center as our first stop to try this spot! We got here around 9AM but it didn't open until 10AM on the dot. A lot of stalls weren't open yet so we just got a drink and waited. Line started forming close to 10AM and the line got long reallly quick. The first orders took awhile and we were prob 3rd or 4th in line. Order the large chicken rice to share with 2 for 7.80.  Chicken was very juicy, soft and tender! Rice was good and goes well. Dip it in the sauce that they give you. I'm not sure if I would wait over 30-60mins for this but if it's your first time in Singapore like us, highly recommend to try this and come early!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,1-Dec-22,"My favorite Hainanese chicken rice hawker in Singapore. I prefer the poach chicken, but you will have the choice of roast or poach. And the rice is nice too. The lines are long, be prepared to wait."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,30-Jul-18,"Underwhelming. I think that's the perfect word to describe my experience eating the infamous Anthony Bourdain/Michelin Star rated Hainan Chicken.  The chicken was cold when we started eating, and the only sauce that came with it is the red sauce, which is quite spicy so be cautious when drenching the chicken for the first time. I also feel like I didn't get a lot of meat for what we paid for. It was mainly just bone ... Another disappointment.  The rice was good but I just feel like I expected so much more and that's not what I got. I've definitely tried better Hainan Chicken back home. Maybe I just had too many expectations but I don't think I'll be back, nor would I recommend this to visiting friends and family. I'm sure there's better places out there."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,16-Apr-18,"Maybe my taste bud for Hainanese chicken is much more Americanized? I hated Tian Tian's slimey, gelatiny texture. The chicken was really wet but not moist. It had been drown in some kind of soy, oil mixture for way too long. Everything was in a half melted jello consistency. The rice was fine but nothing to write home about.  Really turned off by mouthful of gelatinized fat but was later told that part holds the key to every great hainanese chicken rice. Unfortunately, not for me, C plus at best in my book."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,11-Jan-18,"My 2nd favorite place for Hainan chicken rice, love their hot sauce as it has the perfect amount of heat to it.  The chicken is cooked perfectly and melts in your mouth. The rice is very fragrant and service is with a smile.  Just because Anthony Bourdain's picture is in the front doesn't change my mind on how good this place is.  For sure will be back when in SG."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,6-Apr-18,"Delish Hainanese chicken! First time I attempted to try out this place was on a Thursday at around 5:30 pm, about 6 or 7 people ahead of me by the time they completely sold out - sad. Ended up going to Ah Tai (which was delish!).  Tried again on a Friday around 11:45 am. The line was super long, but it moved quickly. We got a medium sized portion for $5 SGD. The rice was delish and the chicken was tender. The spicy sauce was really spicy and so good! I will say that after trying Ah Tai, I felt like Ah Tai was a better value and just as delish. If you're not feeling the wait for tian tian, def try out Ah Tai. Otherwise, tian tian is worth a try!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,7-Feb-20,"There are 2 famous chicken rice places at Maxwell, and they're only a few stalls down from each other. Tian tian was the original and occupies stalls 10-11.  The rice plate comes in small, medium, large. The small is only 3.50 - it's nice to have the option of small so you can try more stuff. They also have other dishes, but the rice plate is the star.  Order at line A and pickup at line B.  The chicken rice is chicken breast (boneless and skinless), which I appreciate. It's super tender. The rice also has good chicken flavor. Warning: the hot sauce sauce is hot."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,10-Sep-23,food was good but i was expecting extraordinary since the reviews are so high. the chicken was flavorful and tender. great for a quick meal. Be ready to stand in a long line
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,25-Sep-19,"Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice at Maxwell Food Center is one of Singapore's busiest food stalls with such fans as Gordon Ramsey and Anthony Bourdain. But what is Hainanese chicken rice? In short -- it's seasoned poached chicken with rice, served with chilli sauce and garnished with cucumber. It was created by immigrants from Hainan province in southern China as a cheap and easy meal.  We hit up the Maxwell Food Center as part of a tour with Sneak Peek Singapore. This stall wasn't part of our tour (that sampled foods from other stalls with no wait). So I recommend tag teaming with someone. The line moves quickly, but anticipate a wait of 20-30 minutes. We BARELY got our chicken in time before our tour nearly left us behind. The stall sells other dishes like vegetables with oyster sauce and cuttlefish. But you basically come here for one dish only -- the famed Hainanese chicken rice. I recommend ordering the most popular option -- a medium-sized chicken rice priced at $5 Singaporean dollars (or about $3.60 USD).  What's the verdict? Was the wait worth it? I think so. The rice was perfectly cooked. Though, the chicken tasted pretty similar to other places we tried. If you have the time to wait (and patience), add it to your foodie check list. Or if you hate waiting like me, tag team with another person to wait in line."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,19-Jul-20,"I'm not going to deny that this is good chicken rice, but I could never justify waiting any more than 20 minutes to have it. Luckily there was no wait when we went a few weeks before CB. Due to its popularity, they have a very streamlined ordering process and we got our chicken rice in no time. The rice is very fragrant and the chicken wasn't that juicy or flavorful. Also tried Ah Tai a few stalls over and thought it was far superior to Tian Tian."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,15-Jan-20,"Another Michelin-rated hawker meal. Another lineup and another great meal for only $5SG. The chicken was smooth and rice was not oily and tastes good. You cannot beat the value/taste proposition for sure. Is this a ""wow, out of this world meal""? Not quite, but still worth a try if you are in the area.."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,6-Oct-19,"maybe more like 3.75 out of 4 stars. if you're in Singapore, you will most likely check out a few hawkers. we actually checked out this Maxwell Food Centre hawker twice in a time span of 24 hours.... lol, once at night when pretty much everything was closed, and once again in the morning to get here before the crowd of people line up at tian tian. this place attracts famous chefs and other famous tv personal (RIP anthony bourdain), so i had to check this place out.  i'm giving it 4 stars, since i did not have to wait that long. i got here around 9:30 and there were a few other people here as well, but when we started lining up, i didn't need to wait more than 5 mins to get the food. and getting the food is very quick.  we got a medium sized hainan chicken rice, bean sprouts and some chicken gizzards. the chicken rice is like as everyone else will say, bomb. however, there is a duck restaurant that's adjacent to this place, and that even better rice. if you can combine that rice with this hainan chicken, it would be the perfect meal. everything was cheap, and filling!  believe this place is cash only."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,21-Mar-17,"Anointed by the Travel Channel giants as THE best chicken rice in Singapore. Recognized by the Michelin Guide as a bib gourmand eatery. All that translates into long lines, sterile service, and a mass produced product that, while good, doesn't live up to the hype.  1. Stand in the long line that disappears around the corner. 2. Place your entire order at the first window. A modern POS spits out a payment receipt and an order tag. 3. Grab a tray and spoons. 4. Hand your order tag (not your payment receipt) to the person at the second window where already assembled plates of chicken rice and hot sauce sit. 5. The number and type of plate will be placed on the tray. 6. Done.  The chicken (ordered large drum that includes thigh meat), tender, juicy and impregnated with a lemon grass, kefir lime leaf flavor. The rice, clearly cooked in the chicken stock but flavor not as deep as expected. Adding the more herbaceous chili sauce adds a good clean chili flavor that does elevate the dish.  Note: no bowl of cooking broth as given by most otther stalls.  A bargain at $3.50 SGD regular, $3.75 SGD large. Choice of breast or drum / theigh meat, half or whole chicken. Side plate of veg also available.  Outstanding for sure, just not the best."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,7-Aug-22,"This place deserves a 6-star rating. Where have you been all my life!? I ate it once and had to keep going back. I woke up dreaming of it for breakfast, wished it was lunch, and possibly fast forward to dinner for this Hainanese Chicken Rice. I love the unpretentious hawker vibe, and then this amazing National dish, a dish a song should be written about -- chicken is super smooth, tender, flavorful. The rice is not over powering but also fragrant and tasty. And it's nice this is a locally loved joint, not just coz of the media hype. Live long and prosper!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,10-Feb-20,"Okay, so its been 9 years since i have been here (yelp was not in singapore yet) but it is still my favorite hainan chicken rice ever! Braving the long lines can be problematic especially when tempted by so many food stalls at the Maxwell food market! Their chicken achieves that elusive perfect balance between cooked just enough to be tender but not too well done for the meat to be dry. Texture is spot on. Gingery sauce and spicy sauce is delicious. I miss this place still"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,24-Nov-17,"Terrific is pretty much all I can say. Incredibly aromatic rice and super juicy tender chicken. First bite is not enough and I ordered Medium. Should have gone large but wanted to leave room for the other hawker stalls.  They definitely earned that superb reputation. The service was fast and nothing beats this, hands down!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,21-Mar-17,"For some reason, I think of this place when I missed Asia.. the chicken and rice is so guud here! I think I'll come back to Singapore -just for this!! Lol  Maybe it's time to go back to Asia soon!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,25-Jan-19,"One of the most delicious finds during my last trip to Singapore!  Hainanese chicken rice can be found on every corner in Singapore but Tian Tian definitely warrant a visit! Nestled in Chinatown's iconic Maxwell Hawker Center, this particular stall is easy to spot thanks to the long lines as well as a big poster of Anthony Bordain next to it. Their menu is pretty straightforward and all the usual suspects are available - steamed/roasted chicken and vegetables in oyster sauce.  For my first visit, I can't decide between the poached or the roasted chicken, so when in doubt, the rule of thumb is to get both! :P. The chicken was tender and juicy while the rice was flavorful with a mouthwatering aroma! Altogether there was a good harmony between the chicken, rice, chili sauce and soy sauce. I honestly love both versions, but the later added a nice smoky flavor that I like.  The pricing was dead cheap with each plate costing around $4-8 SGD (depending on the portions) and food was served canteen style. Simple, affordable and utterly delicious.... Can't help but to fall in love with Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,4-May-19,"We were in full-on tourist mode and decided to try our luck at the super popular Tian Tian stall. It opens at 10am and a line begins to form even before opening time. We were in line by 10:15am and I was concerned about the wait time. The online reported wait times turned out to be quite exaggerated based on our experience. It took us about 15 minutes to get served, and that is only because they were running behind and hadn't opened on time, meanwhile a crowd was building. If we had arrived at 10:45am, the wait would've been at most 5 minutes.  With the volume of business that Tian Tian does, they've perfected the service. You decide what size you want and pay at the first section, then walk over to the second section and pick up your plate of food. Finally, find any seat at the hawker centre and enjoy your meal. It's very simple and efficient.  I have to say that I enjoyed the chicken very much. However, is it better than other chicken rice in Singapore? I think not."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,28-Sep-19,There was a line and they were prepared with lanes set up. It moved pretty quickly though. I think the other famous spot was closed so this one was extra busy. I ordered the thigh and greens on the side. The hardest was finding a spot to sit to eat. The chicken was top notch. Flavorful and super juicy and soft. The pepper was great...I asked for 2. Lol!  I went back before we left and they were closing and only had breast left. They discounted to $5 each. I took 2. Even the breast was super moist. I wish I could eat this every day!
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,19-Dec-19,"There's chicken rice and then there's Tian Tian's chicken rice. This is hands down the best chicken rice I've ever eaten.  The rice is flavorful with a light black sauce and chicken juice gravy over it and the chicken is perfectly moist. It pairs really well with the lime based chili sauce that gives it just the right kick.  The store does lots of takeout orders so you can order ahead if you want to skip the line.  We got there just before the lunch rush on a weekday at 11.30am or so and ended up waiting 10 minutes. It's a well oiled machine but I'd expect a wait of around 15 to 20 minutes during peak times. On the bright side, you can easily spot the store by the long line!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,3-Dec-18,Definitely not as flavorful as advertised by many however is definitely good Hainan Chicken. The gravy now is just...well gravy it adds nothing and takes away nothing and is just kind of there. The rice IS still very flavorful and the chicken is definitely very tender however the subtle aromas you get from really really good Hainan Chicken is just not there unfortunately. Definitely still a great bang for your buck but if the line is too intense I would try another stand! Lots of other delicious options to choose from.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,28-Sep-19,"Tian Tian can be found right in the center of hawker center, where you see the huge line outside. This place is extremely hyped through media and is being recommended on all travel guides and hotels.  Flavor 3.5/5 The chicken is very standard. What's special is the rice which was very flavorful as they have adjusted their recipe multiple times per what I've read online.  Wait and line 1/5 The wait is 30+ minutes at 12pm on Saturday. The wait at Ah tai is much shorter and the taste is very similar as it was opened by someone who used to work at tian tian. Ah tai has a better yelp rating and a better price to value ratio.  Price 4/5 Generally hawker center is cheap. Compared to other hainan chicken places there tian tian is considered slightly more expensive. At ah tai you pay $5 for a set (chicken, rice, soup and veggie) which is unbeatable and you get the best value of the price for sure  Comparison to Ah tai: Tian tian's rice tastes better and is more flavorful as they have adjusted the recipe multiple times since opening. However the price is slightly more expensive with $9 if you want the veggies and chicken. The portions are slightly smaller and you wait faaar longer. Overall tian tian is not worth the wait and is recommend ah tai if you crave or want to experience hainan chicken. If you do have time and what to taste the best one. Take a shot and wait in line"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,22-Jun-21,"Heard that this was one of the most famous chicken rice hawkers in Singapore, but I was quite disappointed. The boiled chicken is tasteless, each serving comes with a few tiny slices of cucumber, and the rice (which is supposed to be fragrant and praised by international chefs) was hard and not fully-cooked."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,13-May-19,"The Tian Tian hawker stall is one of my top recommendations to all my friends who visit SG. They've received the Michelin ""Bib Gourmand"" recommendation, which is right below their star system. Also I've seen Anthony Bourdain's raving review for this place as well. The menu is really simple, the individual orders: Small, Medium, Large or you can buy half or full chicken.  What makes the chicken special is how overly tender (good way) the cuts of chicken are. Typically I order to medium individual sized portion and bean sprouts. Total 7 bucks."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,29-Sep-19,"I was building this up in my head so much, that I was sure I was going to disappointed. Such a cheap Michelin star restaurant - there's gotta be a catch right?  Not with Tian Tian.  We had to wait in line for about 10 mins. Compared to the Bay area, where it takes 10 mins to just find you a table, this was a breeze. The plates & bowls on which they actually served the chicken & soup, while not perfectly clean, was cleaner than the others we had at the hawker centers. Hey, that's how it goes, right?  Now, the actual food. The rice, was something you can eat just by itself. It was flavorful and the aroma was out of this world. And it paired wonderfully with the deliciously supple chicken. The soup just tied it all together.  I was disappointed a little bit cause my chicken had bones?! I was surprised a little bit by that and it did take away something from my experience. But overall, for that price and quality, a must go.  But don't wait in line too long though. The other chicken rice places in the same hawker center and not bad at all."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,3-May-17,"THIS PLACE IS SO FREAKING GOOD!!!!!!! Best chicken and rice I have had in Singapore and let me tell you I ate chicken and rice for 3 days straight at different places but nothing compares.  Meat is juicy, soy sauce is sweet/ salty, rice is perfectly flavored, and the chili sauce is spicy my friend and I came before the lunch rush so there was only a 10 min wait but when we left it was outside the stand.  Only downside would be that in comparison to other places they don't give you as much food for the same price ($4.50 SGD). I know other places I went to it was the same price but it was included with soup and veggies as well. This place just serves chicken rice and cucumbers. Nice and simple but I would have liked some soup on the side for a complete meal.  Definitely worth the wait and the hype! Give it a try if you are ever in Singapore"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,9-Aug-19,"The chicken here is sooo tender and at the same time it's flavourful. The rice that comes with is chicken oil rice, and just like what Antony Bourdain says: it's so good you can eat it itself. We enjoyed this place so much that we came back for a second meal the same day and totally don't regret doing it. The chili lime sauce that comes as a dip, taste delicious too, but beware it can be a bit spicy. It gives the chicken a bit of kick and a twist. It almost taste like a Thai lime sauce. The boiled bak choy comes with a fried shallot sauce, which just makes everything taste better. The squid with bean sprouts came with a Thai sauce and chili but it was not spicy at all. I suggest adding a bit of the chicken dip sauce if you would like a kick."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,2-Jun-16,"This spot is famous for their hainan chicken, so I made it a must stop on my trip to Singapore. We got there right when they opened, so there wasn't a long wait. As we were waiting for our food, the line started to form.  We got a half order which was around $12. The portion is huge! My bf and I shared and still had leftovers. The chicken is moist, but nothing special. I feel like I can get better chicken back home. Sadly, this place was all hype for me."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,30-Oct-18,So good. The line was not that bad on the weekend although our Grab driver told us it was bad during the week bc of the office workers. It was so cheap - $7 for the large. It caught me off guard the chicken was cold but it was so good. The rice was indeed fragrant as Bourdain said. Definitely get this and come on the weekend! It's at the edge so don't get fooled by the other chicken stalls!
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,4-Jun-19,"This place has gone down in quality since I came here 3 years ago. The rice is lacking in flavor with inconsistency in texture. As usual, the line is long likely because there's a photo of Anthony Bourdain. The chicken itself is nothing special, but okay for a first timer trying Hainanese chicken. There are better spots at other hawker centers. I would recommend this place for people who buy into hype, but not for others looking for quality in food."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,27-Nov-18,"Knowing fully well the caliber of this hawker stand among Singapore's finest--I came in with sky high expectations...which is ironic because chickens can't fly.  The chicken & rice is great but not because of the typical reasons. The chicken is extremely fresh and has a very ""clean"" taste. It's not bogged down by a lot of flavors attacking your mouth from all directions--its just a simple, clean, and honest serving of chicken atop a bed of faintly flavored rice. The ginger sauce poured on top ties the dish together in a simple and effective way. I like this dish a lot because it's done right--but it might not be what you think."

Very easy and fast to arrive via Uber. Maxwell Hawker Centre does not disappoint. I had to have the Hainanese Chicken and Rice and side of Chinese broccoli and chilli sauce. Oh man it was the best, juicy and so delicious. It gets pretty busy during the lunch hours. None of the food stalls offer drinks there a plenty of drink vendors in each row to quench your thirst. Continue on to the Buddhist Tooth Relic Shrine."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,18-Nov-18,After trying the chicken rice at Ah Tai I heard there's a battle between that place and Tian Tian for the title of best chicken rice in Singapore. I'll stay away from that debate so I don't get banned from the country due to whoever might be working the customs counter that day :)  I'll say that this place also had really damn good chicken rice! The only thing that I wish Tian Tian had was a bowl of that awesome soup from Ah Tai.  All in all a really good couple of meals at these hawker stands
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,20-May-17,"Overall it is still good Chicken rice.  However, the texture of the rice is not what I like. Does not have that fragrance.  Chicken breast meat (my meat of choice) was nice and tender.  Liver runs out fast too so most times it's hard to get unless you go early.  Chilli is good. They don't give black sauce unless you ask.  They no longer give soup. Not sure if they will if asked.  Be prepared to queue. Just look at the photo I posted. Most times the queue is a lot longer. Think they send the China tourists here by the busloads.  So partly it's the queue and partly the rice and partly the lack of ginger, I still prefer Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice a few doors down from Tian Tian.  I guess Tian Tian will always be famous because of Anthony Bourdain."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,8-Aug-19,"If you want environment this is not the place. However if you want local food this is the place to be. This is not the only place but this this one of the more popular restaurants that make this dish. I'd totally recommend that people try it with the home made spicy sauce they provide. Go light if you can't handle spicy. They will provide two sauce. Get the rice, it really is delicious, there is a light ginger and coconut taste to it.   This is located at the Hawker Centre (Center). There are many different stalls. Explore, try a bit of everything. The drinks are cheap, average $1.50-2 USD.  You have to find your own seats and I'd say have one person buy and one hold the seats. You won't regret trying it here. You can leave the place without sending too much per person, depending how much you can eat. I'd say an average of $10 per person including drinks."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,28-Nov-18,"This place was good, but to me, didn't live up to all the hype (or the long line that I waited in prior to opening). I would even argue that the place 3 stalls down (Ah Fat?) was more tender and delicious.  Don't get me wrong -- you can get good chicken and rice at a very reasonable price ($4 SGD for the regular plate), but I don't know that I would wait too long for this, especially with all the other options available.  You can tell that this place is used to the popularity -- modern cash register/computer system with an ordering system up front and a pickup in the next stall. Tip: If you come after opening, you shouldn't have to wait in too long of a line."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,1-Jun-18,"Went to Singapore and checked out where to eat at hawker centers (essentially food courts). Boom. Tian Tian was apparently a must. I waited in a line (brief wait) for some chicken, and it was bomb. I was also starving. But none the less, still a good place to try if you're in the area. Wouldn't go out of my way though."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,16-Mar-19,"10am on a Sunday morning, I was at the Maxwell Food Centre in Singapore. We decided to go for Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice Restaurant, simply because of the many positive Yelp reviews and also the fact that the place was featured by Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsay. The restaurant opens at 10am and already there is a very long lineup. Other places serves similar menu and gets only customers who have no patience for waiting in line. Service was very fast, but do not expect too much, except having a chance to taste this famous dish as this a food court and tables are not necessarily spotlessly clean. I ordered 2 Hainanese Chicken Rice. The cashier pointed to 2 vegetable dishes displayed as pictures on the board, cuttlefish sprout and bokchoy vegetables. I ordered one of each, thinking that these came complementary as part of the menu I ordered. Had I known, I would have skipped the vegetables. 15 minutes later, I was walking away with my order. Bill comes to $18, being $5 for Hainanese Chicken and $4 for the vegetables. The chicken is very tender, so tender that it just melts in your mouth. There are no bones and practically no fat. But, frankly, I am more used to have chicken which has a bit of a bite. There is a sauce that you get on the side that would spice the food up, but I find the meat to be quite bland without. Very affordable, and worth a try."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,2-Apr-16,"This chicken rice stall is famous because Anthony Bourdain featured it on his show. It's also how I came about finding this stall. Though, I have to say there were about 20 people ahead of me in the queue and majority of them where Singaporeans, so it can't be that bad, right?   It's boiled chicken; honestly I think it's a cooking style that won't suit a lot of Westerners. It's more about textures rather than flavors. I ordered a large and it came with its own plate of rice. The chicken was lean with a bit of fat and the meat overall was soft and juicy. The skin was very silky and went well with the rice. Under was a layer of cucumbers, which to me was pointless.  The highlight was the rice! Superbly fragrant, a little oily and I could taste the ginger and garlic. Chicken rice is Singapore's national dish, so it's worth trying at least once even if it's not Tian Tian's version!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,24-Jan-20,"Okay, do bear in mind I have been to Singapore 8 or so times in the last 3 years.. Still have not made to this place until recently. I had one day that I was in Singapore before the work week started and I had made a determination to check off the lists on my guidebook. Botanical garden, orchid garden, garden by the bay's skywalk, Chinatown was next. So I arrived and it was hot - so I was very lost and was happy to be lost. Lined up to get a milk tea and someone recommended me to this spot. All I really wanted was Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore. Truth be told, it's changed in the last decade, or maybe I've changed. The first time I had it was in 2010. I thought it was disgusting. I did not have any acquired taste for Asian food then. I barely saw any Asians in my life. Now I must admit, I've got a more refined taste for everything Asian. Tian tian has a line. On a Sunday afternoon at 3:55 PM. All tourists, I gathered. Anthony Bourdain was here. The lady in front of me was from London, Asian British lady. On her honeymoon. We chatted about this spot, and we each ordered a small plate. Holy cow, $3 USD basically. We ate happily with chili on the side (we made friends while standing in line).  The location is called Maxwell Center or something with Maxwell in it. You need to walk away from Chinatown, passing by some super cool buildings that house Chinese restaurants into a hawker market space area. Excellent atmosphere. Exceptional chicken dish.  I would definitely take friends and families there. Not that I have anyone who would visit me in Singapore. Not that I go to Singapore that often. But this chicken is growing on me. And this stall."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,13-Feb-19,"Yes, Tian Tian is definitely a tourist destination in the Maxwell Food Center. Popular tourist destinations tend to be known for being overrated, but I thought that Tian Tian served a decent chicken rice dish. You'll notice that there is always a long line for this stall, but the line moves pretty quickly.  I ordered a large roasted chicken with rice. The portion sizes here are on the smaller size, so my ""large"" order was much smaller than I expected. The roasted chicken was nicely cooked, but the rice was what stole the show for me. The rice had a very strong chicken aroma and flavor that made it quite delicious. The red chili sauce that came on the side added a rather strong spicy kick to each bite (it was spicier than I expected).  I enjoyed the chicken rice that I got here. While the portions here were small, the chicken was flavorful and the rice was even more delicious. All of this for such a cheap price? Tian Tian has my vote."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,20-Dec-16,"We went to the Maxwell Road Hawker Centre specifically for the Tian Tian Hainanese chicken rice. Luckily, the line wasn't long so we didn't have to wait much.  I wouldn't say the chicken was all that great. It looked a bit raw, so there were parts we decided not to eat. However, the rice was so good. It was so flavorful, I think I could have eaten a whole plate of just the rice itself."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,27-Nov-18,"I mean, it was good, but definitely not what I envisioned.  I wouldn't want to wait in line here for more than 15 mins. We got here before it opened, and only 5 people were in front of us, which was not bad at all. We waited about 10 mins in line on a weekday. Of course we wanted to come here, since we all saw this episode on Anthony Bourdain's show!  My fiance and I ordered one medium to share, since we wanted to try other Hawker stalls too. We honestly had the same underwhelmed reaction. Yes, the chicken was okay, but it was served cold, which I'm guessing is how it's supposed to be prepared. I guess I've been eating Hainanese chicken wrong my whole life (warm). The rice was DAMN GOOD though, with all the chicken fat drippings saturating the warm carb.  I mean, yeah, it was good for a few dollars, but not something I'd go back for. I'd rather try other Hainanese chicken places, without lines, and just as good ratings. Maybe I just don't like Hainanese chicken after all. Who knows.  But overall, I'm glad I went here, and if you watched that episode of Anthony Bourdain, you will want to too to check another box off your bucket list."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,17-Apr-18,"This is the best Hainan Chicken I've ever had in my life. The first time I came, they were sold out, as well as the other famous Hainan Chicken made by a former chef. The only ones open were the Maxwell's Hainan and some other one. Those were good, but nothing special compared to what I can find at home or just make myself. Tian Tian is ridiculously tender/juicy/flavorful. The rice could be eaten all by itself. You can taste the flavor and texture of every granule of rice. I dream of this place and their Hainan chicken. By far, the best place I ate in Singapore. I would definitely come back (I actually went twice during my trip!)."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,21-Nov-18,"I don't know why the heck this place is so freaking busy but it is. Their was a line before they even opened. I don't even like this kind of chicken but my kids do, so I came for them."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,20-Jan-20,"My friends and I went to Singapore recently and planned our days around eating. Of course Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice was on our list and luckily we went when there were only a few people in line! We ordered 2 large plates of Chicken and Rice and 1 plate of Beansprouts and Cuttlefish to share. The chicken was perfectly poached and tender and the chicken-stock rice was fragrant and flavorful, the dish was served with a citrus chili sauce which was unique and tasty. We lucked out with not having to wait but I've heard a wait of 45mins-60mins is standard, a must try if ever in Singapore."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,21-May-16,"Food: 3.5/5.0 Service: 1.5/5.0 Value: 4.0/5.0 Decor: 2.0/5.0 Overall: 3.5/5.0  SGD5 for a chicken rice is on the higher side for this center, and the shop definitely struck me as perhaps a bit over-rated given how not mind-blowing the food was. If you're a local, for sure go for a line-less, slightly cheaper alternative. If you're visiting, do Tian Tian at least once. There's not always a long line, and as others have stated, the line moves quickly."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,8-Apr-19,"I've heard a lot of hype about this place since it's one of the most famous chicken rice places in Singapore. I have to say that it definitely lived up to the hype! The food was delicious and the wait isn't too bad at all. I'd definitely come back again.  I ordered the medium size chicken rice. The chicken itself had decent flavor, though was a bit oily. The rice was fragrant and tasty by itself, and these tasted even better with some of the chili. I did feel that the portion was a bit small, so for many it maybe worth going for the large size. Although for $5 I really can't complain.  Beware that the Hawker Center this place is in can get very crowded. I came on Saturday for lunch and all of the large round tables were completely full, so had to sit on a small table at the edge of the Hawker Center. The queue can be a bit intimidating but the workers are very efficient and I was able to get my food in probably less than 10 minutes."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,24-Apr-19,"Again like my 328 Katong laksa review. Success has gone to their heads and wallet. it's a good thing I went to another hawker the day before so I could compare. Anthony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmerman have given these places international fame and success. Now to my review, from a Pake' ( from Hawaii ) point of view. Value 1 star they did not give soup, no chicken skin literally on the chicken. you had to stand in long line 20 min. Flavor wise the chickens taste the same from the different hawker stall I ate at. Now. Wait for it. ...... The rice was what was advertised light fluffy and flavorful. 5 star. Worth trying yes."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,18-Feb-19,Good food good chicken soup which comes with your order. You can't go wrong with any of these hawker stalls bc they rely on local patronage and us being foreigners can reap the benefit. Unless they've been spoiled by good bourdain or zimmerin reviews
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,11-Dec-19,"I can understand why this place is so popular (we showed up around 11 and there already was a line). The chicken was very tender and moist, though I'm confused by why there was no skin included. Rice was also well flavored, if a bit too soft for my taste. No aircon in the hawker center, so grab a coconut or soursop juice from one of the stalls across and you're good to go."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,9-Jul-19,"This was a must visit destination on our Singapore itinerary, Michelin starred Hainanese Chicken Rice. I have watched every YouTube video on this dish. The likes of Anthony Bourdain and Mike Chen (YouTuber) have raved about it. Having eaten over a hundred Hainanese Chicken Rice dishes I was about to eat the world's best.  Located in a hawker like setting, be prepared to sweat bullets. We decided to go at night. Once inside this area, with stall after stall of open kitchen, you will feel the heat. It's hotter than outside. The line is long but it moves fast. Not going to lie, I am not used to these conditions. As my son and I grab a table with strangers, we wait with the large fans above blowing at us with no relief. As the dishes are placed in front of me, I can tell how juicy and succulent the dark meat looks. What I didn't quite expect was the strange gelatinous coating all over the chicken. I'm not sure what that is but I dig in. It is beyond tender and the skin on the chicken was very silky. Again, I was a bit bothered by that gelatinous coating. As I take each bite, it was hard to eat as the large fans kept blowing my hair and getting stuck against my sweaty face. I had to make sure I wasn't eating my hair and the chicken at the same time. Unfortunately, I've had more fragrant chicken rice than this before. It's still good but nothing special. All in all we did enjoyed the meal. The method where they quickly poach their chicken works. Had I have eaten it in a much cooler environment, I might have enjoyed my meal better.  There are no napkins as Singapore has a go-green policy. You can wash your hands at a sink as you exit out."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,26-Oct-17,"Mmmm chicken rice! Since my visit at Tian Tian, nothing has really compared to give there chicken rice real competition.  Located in the Maxwell Food Centre hawkers is where I found Tian Tian. I knew to come here because I researched beforehand best chicken rice in Singapore. Tian Tian got voted such by local foodies and celebrity chef, Anthony Bourdain. If that wasn't reason enough, a helpful hint I always go by is that you always eat where the locals flock to. There's a good reason for that line you're about to stand in.  Service didn't take long at all, and this line was only 3 people deep. You get served on the spot, we ordered two servings of chicken rice. That's the reason we came here. The rice was fragrant, with chicken was so tender and smooth. The skin didn't bother me, it was thin and not chewy like eating a fatty piece on meat. The broth complimented it all with chili and soy sauce; it was perfect."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,9-Jan-20,"Absolutely amazing hawker food, if you are big on a wide flavour profile or spread of food, may not be the place for you."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,7-Jan-16,"Truth be told...I never tried the Hainanese Chicken Rice before and wasn't sure what the hype was about other than the famous Anthony Bourdain visiting this stall. Came here with a couple of friends and we went super early before opening time to avoid the long lines.  Place opened roughly around 10am, but do be prepared to wait in a line since this place is pretty popular among the locals and tourists. Wait time for the food wasn't too long and the portion amount was decent.  Overall, the chicken rice wasn't mind blowing, but rather, it was a tasty dish. The rice was quite flavorful and fragrant and the chicken was soft and tender. I definitely like the house made chili that definitely had a lot of zing and spicy to it.  Still haven't figured out why there is such a craze for this dish but it's worth the try if you like chicken rice. Also, I noticed that a lot of other competing chicken rice stalls have a similar look to Tian Tian, so do check the names before waiting in line if you're looking for the ""famous"" chicken rice place (aka Tian Tian).  Another recommendation I have is if you're in a group, have one person make the order for everyone. Saves time and it does make the line shorter ;)"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",1,4-Jun-19,"Do yourself a favor and go to Ah Tai Hainan Chicken three stalls down instead.  Contrary to popular belief, Tian Tian is not on the Michelin Bib Gourmand list -- it's actually Ah Tai that has that honor (listed as ""Ah Gong"" in the guide). Another reason why Tian Tian always has a longer line is because of Anthony Bourdain... and sadly, I have to disagree with him on this one.  I tried both Tian Tain and Ah Tai, and I can confidently say Tian Tian is all hype. If you're from Los Angeles, you're probably familiar with Savoy's Hainan chicken, which locals always rave about. I have never liked that place and I'd rather eat there than the atrocity Tian Tian serves. The meat and rice here is so bad, dry, and flavorless. Skip!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,14-Apr-17,"I don't know that Tian Tian is so radically different from other chicken rice places to warrant the line that starts winding around the corned even before opening time. But it is well executed, a tiny plate filled with two ways to mainline chicken flavor.  (1) the chicken, which somehow tastes less like chicken than (2) the rice, which tastes like ten chickens. The chicken, pillowy and soft like a baby's skin, needs the accompanying spicy sauce and is mostly enjoyable for its texture. The rice needs nothing."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,16-Jan-19,"Feels like some KFC guys discovered the existence of real chicken. Yes it's good, it's chicken, but nothing special about this one in particular when you already have had well cooked chicken. On the other hand, the little sauce that goes with it is pretty interesting."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,18-Aug-18,"Famous chicken rice stall in SG's Maxwell hawker center. The rice is very fragrant - strong chicken stock smell. The chicken is juicy and tender which makes a good combo to the rice. The drawback is the dish was just too oily for my taste and the chicken has a bit too much red meat (I personally prefer white meat chicken for chicken rice). The accompanying chili sauce helps give a bit of contrast to the oiliness but nonetheless not the best chicken rice in SG for me.  We also tried the stall next to it (which is a spin-off from the original restaurant) - while the taste overall is similar, I do find Tian Tian's rice a little bit more fragrant. But if Tian Tian's line is super long (as it sometimes is during peak hours), you can't go wrong with the stall next door"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,27-Apr-18,"What can i really say that hasn't been already said. This place has the allure of a 1 Michelin Star and visits from US celebrity chefs/reviewers like Bourdain.  In the one of many hawker courts across SG, this one stands out with multiple chicken rice joints with this one being the most famous and the lines prove it.  For any hainanese chicken to stand out, it's not just the silky smooth mead cut the ginger and spicy sauces that accompany. You've got to get the oily/chicken flavored rice to be fragrant as well and this place honors all the check off boxes well.  There are PLENTY of chicken rice options in this incredible city/country, this particular one found a way to get famous is all."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,10-Jan-18,"This place lives up to its hype. I had the traditional chicken rice which came with some chili and sliced cucumbers. A small was perfect for lunch. In hindsight I wish I had the next size up. I can still taste the aromatic rice and the tender chicken. The chili has the perfect amount of kick.  All in all, this is a must have while in Singapore."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,11-May-17,"Whenever you have something so hyped up, whatever it is, it rarely meets the expectation for most. I always take that into consideration and so I actually avoid reading a lot of reviews in depth and just let my own taste buds decide. And if your taste buds are like Lily F.'s then you'll be very happy with Tian Tian's Chicken.  The line's not that long, you guys. I mean, it looks long, but when you have a team of 7 no non-sense Chinese people trying to bust out as many chicken meals as possible to take your money, you won't wait more than 15 mins. And I was completely outside, the line wrapped around the building. I ordered the half chicken because I wanted to gorge myself on this dish. I liked it a lot! The chicken was cold, very smooth and velvety, if that makes sense. I actually liked the sauce, but thought that there was too much of it and would have been very content with just the ginger chili sauce which was the best I have had in Sing. They poured a lot of the soy-based sauce on my dish and I ended up tasting that more than the chicken. Rice was good, but not as memorable for me. Like most, I wanted to complain about the rice and the vegetables costing extra. And I miss my clear broth soup. It helps wash everything down. But it was $12 SIN so yeah...It was awesome.  Come here if you have the chance. It's definitely worth the visit and judge for yourself."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,16-Jun-17,"Located within Maxwell Hawker Centre is probably the best Hainanese Chicken Rice you can find in Singapore. This place is really worth the hype, it has won multiple awards and beat Gordon Ramsey in a hawker food challenge, and the prices are very reasonable. Go at an off peak hour to avoid the lines and the wait shouldn't be more than 5 minutes.  We ordered a whole chicken, a vegetable with oyster sauce, and three rice for the three of us and were able to finish everything. Unlike other places that just serves their chicken plain, at Tian Tian they dress up their chicken with an awesome sauce that makes it taste velvety smooth. They also don't offer the typical chicken broth or ginger sauce but those aren't really necessary. The rice itself was fragrant and full of flavor, and the garlic chili sauce was just perfect with the right amount of heat. The vegetable with oyster sauce is just your typical baby bok choy blanched in water so nothing to rave about, but we always order some veggies with every meal.  Definitely stop by here to try Singapore's national dish and eat like a local."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,11-Jan-19,"I love Hainan Chicken Rice and given that Tian Tian is the most famous in all of Singapore for theirs, I had to stop in to give it a try. This hawker stall is located inside Maxwell Food Center and can be easily spotted by the epic-sized line formed down from their stall. The line does move fairly quickly and our wait was about 20 minutes in total.  We got the larger plate just because we waited so long. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the dish. It didn't even make it to the top 10 best Hainan Chicken Rice I've had.  First off, the chicken was ice cold. I understand that some place don't serve their chicken hot but having chicken that basically just came out of the fridge is quite unappetizing. The chicken was also not trimmed off fat and the meat was tough.  The rice and sauce was decent but average at best. They were definitely not enough to redeem the dish from the tough cold chicken meat. I would definitely recommend skipping this place."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,16-Aug-20,"Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice is listed in just about every guidebook of Singapore. Even Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsay rave about how flavoursome their chicken rice is! Talk about fresh, tender and juicy chicken meat served with spicy chili sauce, minced ginger and piping hot rice... need I say more? Just Yum!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,21-Oct-20,"I know a 5-star rating is potentially controversial for Tian Tian which has been a victim of its own success. Before all the hullabaloo, before No Reservations, it was just a solid choice for chicken rice at Maxwell Food Centre. And you know what? It continues to be a solid choice, delivering a solid consistently good, wholesome, flavorful, and traditionally authentic product. So take away everything that's been written or said about Tian Tian in recent history and it'll stand on its own as a solid choice for chicken rice if you're in the neighborhood. Is there a better chicken rice out there? Almost certainly, but that misses the entire point of a chicken rice stall in a food centre in Singapore. At the end of the day, it's all about accessibility. That these hawker centres were purpose-built to make affordable nutrition accessible. That hawkers, over the years, have devoted time and passion into making their offerings actually good is a wondrous unintended consequence of this most Singaporean of experiments. So yes, Tian Tian is still good, pandemic or no, and hopefully will continue to be a solid go to option when wandering around Maxwell. Do I think it's the best chicken rice in Singapore...for that answer you'll have to get to know me much better first."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,6-Apr-18,This is the best chicken rice in my mind! Reasonable price and perfect portion for a girl. Definitely the number one on my must try list to recommend for every of my visitor.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,2-Mar-15,"Thanks to Bourdain, Tian Tian has achieved celebrity status. Yes it's good, but definitely not the best chicken rice in Singapore. Still if you're in Maxwell Road market during off peak hours, it's worth trying Tian Tian if the line isn't long.  I jumped into the line when I noticed it was just a couple of folks on a weekday at around 3pm. That's when I noticed they had receipts with them. I obviously missed something. It did indeed turn out to be too good to be true. Tian Tian's recent notoriety has enabled them to take over the stall next door solely for taking orders and handling payment so customers move assembly-line style down to the next stall to receive their order. It's efficient but not very friendly.  The rice is the star - fragrant and flavorful. The chicken is really moist and works well with the chili sauce. Thick soy sauce is available too but you have to request it which you should. All in all, pretty stellar chicken rice."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,17-Nov-17,"What can be said that hasn't already been SAID!  DAMN good Chicken Rice. There are a lot of great Chicken Rice places and being a Westerner I'll be honest, I can't really tell the small difference between them. But what I can tell you is what tastes good. And this dish, is one of those damn good ones. Maxwell Hawker center itself is a little smaller and easier to navigate. It's a good introduction if you're new the hawker area.  Get you some"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,7-Feb-17,"Overall - 4.0/5.0  Came here on a weekday and luckily there was no line up! I passed by this joint on a weekend a couple days later and saw the line running all the way out to the streets before you even get into the hawker centre!  The chicken and rice dish definitely hit the spot. The skin was full of oil that was naturally coming out from the chicken and melts right in your mouth. As well, the chicken meat was super tender and juicy. It is always a pleasure eating chicken in Asia as it is much more naturally flavourful than the ones in America. The rice itself was decent but was expecting it to be more aromatic.  Highly recommend folks to come here and give them a try as it is one of the top spots in Singapore."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,23-Dec-17,Consistently is key and Tian Tian nails it. I was here a last year and it tastes exactly how it did then. Love how the chicken is so damn tender and juicy. I worship we had something close to it here in the Bay Area!  It's my go to spot when I'm in the mood for something simple but satisfying. Price is very reasonable which makes it even more appealing!  Grab a beer from the drink stall across the way and you're golden!
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",1,11-May-19,Worst example of chicken rice. Worse than normal food court chicken rice. Long queues and the auntie will scold you for queueing "wrong".  Really not worth the wait or the money.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,1-Apr-13,"Dear Anthony Bourdain,  With ""no reservations"", I'm writing due to my fair lady, who has been one of your many fans for the longest time, for your video highlighting the chicken rice experience in Singapore. Before her visit to Singapore, she sent me a link to your video (I'm sorry I've never cared enough to watch any of your shows even though I'm practically always on Food Network) and MADE me watch it so that I could bring her there.  Well, that's the thing...that video and your stupid picture on the stall makes people think that the stall is freaking good because you ""approved"" it.  Oh, please.  It is quite obvious in the video that you would have never tried chicken rice if the crowd didn't BOO the living crap out of you (which I've done since I first watched one of your shows).  So I must say - as I did to my fair lady - that I knew of Tian Tian way before you even highlighted it in your story. Singaporeans know their food and will never need your picture or ""approval"" to seal in the awesomeness of a particular stall.  For example, I just look for a freaking line that is longer than your achievements and know that the food will be GREAT. Just like on the day that I binged on two orders of chicken rice to try both the roast and the standard steamed version...I tried the porridge with a line that took nearly 40 minutes before I got to order...that DIDN'T have your face on their stall.  For the record, do us all non-fans of yours a favor before we bash you even more and tell the truth to your fans (such as my fair lady) that your ""approval"" of this stall is worthless because your opinion on Asian food (or all other local food) just doesn't count. Not to mention, if the crowd didn't boo you, I'm 100% sure you wouldn't have tried chicken rice.  You fail.  Tian Tian just WINS enough to grace you with their attention so you can make a buck by featuring it.  Get a real chef job.  Sincerely,  ChickenRice-Fan  Yelp 100: 24/100"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,1-Jun-19,Best Hainam chicken place I have eaten. So good that we came back here to eat on the next day during our 3 days trip in Singapore.  The place is normally pack. Come early if you can to avoid waiting in line.  If you have 3 or 4 ppl. Try order half or full chicken and buy rice and veggies separately. You get more meat this way.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,14-Apr-17,"Is it worth the hype?! I would say it met expectations. I was pleasantly surprised to not be disappointed. The chicken was tender. The sauce was the perfect amount of spicy. The rice was oh so fragrant and brothy. It helped that we didn't have to wait long for the food. The short line at 10:30am on a Saturday moved very quickly.  To get the most popular dish, ask for chicken rice( only comes in medium size) all for only 5 SGD!  Loved the dish, Travel Channel didn't disappoint and now I miss Singapore =("

It might not be the best in Singapore but I felt like I was in one of Anthony Bourdain's show and got to travel around the world and eat... (but I really here travelling the world just to eat?)  I will remember this chicken rice whenever I have the ""chicken rice"" at home, the tasteless chicken that were dry and tough..... Even the soy sauce here tasted much better..."

It wasn't super awesome or anything, but just enough for me to crave for it a second time around.  And it isn't the most super clean stalls, but the workers make a real good attempt of cleaning throughout the day.  It's cash only here."

Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,15-Apr-14,"I was told Tian Tian has the best hainan chicken in Singapore. That's why even though it was closed the first day I went (on a Thursday evening!?) I decided to go again the next day.  Well, first things first, the price was unbeatable. Only $4 for a chicken rice plate?! Although the portion wasn't that big, it was pretty filling and I felt kind of full with just one plate. It was probably the rice - which had a fantastic smell of chicken oil+coconut. The chicken however was just okay. It wasn't very tender and a bit on the dry side. But again the experience of eating the rice itself was so enjoyable that it added points to the chicken as well.  I give 4 stars mostly because of the price and the rice. Quality of the chicken and the long line doesn't really justify it to be a 5-star restaurant. If I could go to Singapore again, this wouldn't be on my list of ""must-go"" restaurants but I wouldn't mind dropping by and grabbing a plate."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,6-Nov-19,"The chicken was moist, tender and tasty. I ordered medium chicken and rice with a small vegetables with oyster sauce.  As a tourist, I visited the popular hawker stands Hacker Chan and Tian Tian. Food wise, the chicken was better at tian tian - so if you only have time to visit one, my vote is tian tian. However, cleaniness wise - hawker Chan is cleaner.  I went to tian tian at 5pm on a Sunday and they hadn't run out of chicken and there were only two people waiting in line.  Tourist tip - they don't have napkins at any hawker stands anywhere. Singapore people carry around a small pack of tissues that serve as napkins. If you go, bring something to wipe your hands."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,16-Jun-19,"Stopped by on a Sunday about 20 minutes before opening and was 3rd in line. The line quickly built up as the time approached opening. Got a medium chicken and rice. The chicken was super tender and a bit gelatinous. Rice was fragrant. Overall, it was great to try but doesn't seem like it was that much better than what others would serve. Was pleased with the experience but I probably wouldn't have been happy if I waited like an hour or more."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,7-Oct-19,After eating this chicken rice I've realized that other chicken rice aren't good anymore. I got the medium sized and regretted not ordering large. I'm going back next time and try the rest in the menu. The line wasn't that long when I went there cause it was just 10am. But during lunch expect the line would be longer.  I'm not done with my reviews. I will keep you guys posted for more updates.  I'm giving it 4 stars cause I'm still looking for a better chicken rice that will melt in mouth like tian Tian's
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",1,2-Dec-16,"I am not very often angry when receiving bad food. Disappointed, yes. Upset, maybe but never angry.  While I know that food review sites and awards are always subjected to the reviewer's tastebuds, I never really thought that I would get so angry over a stall that doesn't deserve its award..... until today.  For years I've been wanting to give Tian Tian Chicken Rice a try but could never bring myself to join the crazy queue. Than came Singapore's edition of the Michelin Guide and with a Bib Gourmand recommendation, the queues became even longer and after tasting it for the first time today....I can't help but think WHY?  Tian Tian chicken rice lacks just about everything I would consider as a good chicken rice.  The Rice. While the texture of the rice was fine, it was neither fragrant or tasty. It lacked the depth that a lot of better chicken rice places have. It didn't have that pungent garlic or ginger taste, or the umami-ness of the chicken stock used to cook the rice. While the colour looked on point, the flavours were severely lacking.  The Chicken Seeing that it was our first time trying, we ordered a portion of white (boiled) chicken and a portion of the roasted. Portions were generous but the meat was overcooked and stringy. The white chicken didn't have the smooth, moist , juicy texture that help make chicken rice so famous. Instead, it was overcooked and stringy. The roast chicken didn't fair any better. Overcooked, stringy and the skin didn't offer any flavours to the protein.  The only plus point was the sauce that was drizzled over the chicken, which was fragrant and tasty but even that could not offer any redemption to the overall disappointment to the dish.  To the tourists that have tried it because of the Bib Gourmand, my sincerest apologies for not offering you the best chicken rice experience in Singapore and for those you are thinking about trying, please don't, there are better options out there.  Michelin recommended? Better to rip that page out of the book."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,31-Dec-17,"The hawker stands here were incredible, but the Chicken Rice was definitely the star. It just looks like a pile of normal rice but it has such a rich flavor and pairs really well with the pretty unassuming chicken. The drink stands are separate from the rest of the food stands, so be sure to grab a beer to pair with it like a Tiger. The Bok Choy was also delicious, it was super rich (and very oily, so be aware of that).  We went to the stands at around 4pm, so most of them were closed or closing, but this was still open and the line was in-and-out. Be sure to bring a pack of tissues, as the eating area wasn't particularly clean-looking by western standards -- but that totally wasn't a problem at all! Definitely come here for the chicken rice and check out the rest of the stands!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,31-May-17,"Chicken Rice is the official unofficial dish of Singapore. Everyone says you have to try it when you go to Singapore so we decided to try out the most famous place in the city.  Of course there was a line here, but the service is really fast. I got the chicken rice for $3.50 SGD. The chicken is almost like a sou vide preparation where it is barely cooked with a savory sauce poured on top of it and the rice.  It wasn't my favorite dish, but it was tasty. I think the popularity has more to do with it being a traditional comfort food for locals. The one thing that locals really like, but others don't' really understand why they love it so much. Maybe my tastes are the weird one and everyone else likes it. I suggest you try it for yourself."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,24-Sep-16,"Sooooo, this was my first time in Singapore, and my first time at a Hawker center. Tian Tian was recommended to me by a Singaporean-Malaysian-Chinese friend from the states who had visited before. This was also my first time trying Hainanese Chicken rice. I was impressed to say the least.  Lemme just say, this place is hyped up but it's for a reason. This is a ~no-frills, order at the counter, sit down in the Singapore humidity~ and eat type of establishment.  When we approached the stall, there was already a small line formed. First, you pay for your order then you wait as it's assembled. I waited for about 10 minutes before receiving my food. I ordered a medium sized chicken rice, with the soy sauce and the spicy sauce. It.Was.INCREDIBLE.  The chicken was perfect. I'm a big fan of big flavor, and I was a little surprised that boiled chicken would be so good. I mixed with the thickened soya sauce and it was heaven. The rice was fluffy and in the words of Anthony Bourdain ""absolutely fragrant."" and the cucumbers added perfect, refreshing crunch. I was STARVING on this day, and I just had to go back for seconds. I ordered myself a small size chicken rice this time, the cooks at the counter chuckled and said ""back for more?"" I said ""Its so good, can't stay away."" They had a hoot and I left absolutely satisfied.  ** As a tip; the small and medium sized are pretty much exactly the same. So save yourself a couple of SGD and order a small! You'll get the same amount. **  This place is delicious. An absolute can't miss in Singapore. Boy, wish we had this back in the States."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,9-May-16,"Hainanese Chicken Rice  I came here following many recommendation from tourist books/ guides. But sometime I do wonder whether is true. However now that I have tried this, I can see why this is a must place to try.  This is so delicious I could eat several boxes. The chicken was succulent and what Chinese people would say ºÃ»¬. (Meat is so juicy). The rice is full of chicken flavour and nor too greasy either. This is a large box for under $8 SD very value for money."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,22-Mar-16,"This place has the best Hainanese chicken rice I've ever had. I order this dish anywhere it's available, so I've had my fair share of Hainanese chicken rice. But this place has the best. This unassuming food stand that seems to always have a line wrapping around the corner at Maxwell is it. The rice is so flavorful that I can eat two bowls and still want more. I'm not a fan of white meat due to typical dryness, but when they ran out of chicken drumstick/leg, I had to settle for breast. And to my surprise, the white breast meat was tender and juicy. The chicken skin is super smooth and silky. I usually don't eat chicken skin, but I just couldn't help myself. During my short two days visit, this is the only thing I ate more than once. So, this place is legit."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,1-Dec-15,"**OVERHYPED HAINANESE CHICKEN AND RICE**  Seriously, why the mad hype? Thanks, Anthony Bourdain.  AMBIANCE ========= Hawker-style. There will be a line, but it moves quickly.  FOOD ===== Ordered the $3.50 small order which comes with rice and steamed chicken. Chicken and rice were decent, nothing mind blowing. Rice wasn't THAT fragrant. The chicken wasn't THAT flavorful. RATING: 3/5  OVERALL ======== It's ""ai-right"". Had better, but for a few bucks, it's not bad for lunch."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,26-Jun-16,"I got there early, just right after the opening time, and able to avoid any line. 10 minutes into my meal, the queue was quite long. Quick and efficient service, nothing fancy.  Have to say I enjoyed my meal a lot! The rice is soft and fragrant, tender chicken meat (though mine was a bit cold), and the vegetables were crunchy and sweet.  I ordered Medium Chicken Rice, and struggled to finish it all, big portion! For 2 - 4 people, I recommend order half chicken and add some rice, great portion and affordable."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,4-Sep-16,"Tian Tian is in a food court, so, we took full opportunity and buffed up our chicken rice meal with giant Coconuts and Popiah from the other stalls.  Back to the main event, the line for Tian Tian was really insane. At the time, I was told that some stalls in Singapore recently gotten themselves a Michelin star and I was wondering if this was one of them (I checked, they don't have one...yet). I'm pretty sure that when we arrived at 1pm, we had at least 30 people in front of us. However, I must give them props for efficiency, it was far quicker than expected.  We ordered Hainanese chicken rice, Beansprouts (taugeh) and Vegetables with oyster sauce. I think the reason why it is so famous is their absurdly fragrant rice! The sauce on the hainanese chicken is really good too! On top of that, the hainanese chili sauce is really very good!  If you have time, want a decent hainanese chicken rice, come here. However, please don't be too overdressed, it gets kind of hot in this food court."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,10-Dec-15,"I didn't think the menu would be that complicated so I said uhhhh 1 order please? (expecting a little help). Somehow I ended up with skinless chicken breast. They pour a thin gravy over it and that's all you get over rice.  Everything was bland. Very disappointed. They're probably resting on their laurels at this point, although I'm not sure if it was ever deserved, just press from Bourdain....  Tong Fong Fatt in this same Maxwell Food center was better, at least it came with soy and chili sauce.  Rooster & Rice in SF is the best haha!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,14-Apr-19,"The first time I had this a few years ago, it was amazing. This time i felt the hainan chicken was still good, but not as good as before."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",1,26-Dec-17,"Drop by Maxwell market on a Saturday afternoon and saw the stall has almost no queue. Told the cashier that I wanted a plate of chicken rice and was told $5. As a plate of drumstick plus rice was $4.30 I asked what else is included. Immediately she said no drumstick, and I said your menu said so. Immediately she printed another receipt for a plate of chicken rice at $3.50. This is the going price for a hawker stall elsewhere. I wondered how much the tourists in front of me paid for the similar looking plate of chicken rice. The cashier obviously know what she was doing.  The chicken rice was in clumps, made worst by the thick sauce they pour on the chicken possibly to flavour it. Chicken was not flavourful as they need to poured the thick sauce over it. Good steamed chicken does not need any condiments. Enough said.  The old Swee Kee chicken rice wins hands down compared to this."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",1,28-Nov-15,"Overly rated because someone put their stall name into the tourism guide book. I always found the rice too oily and over priced. This time round, nothing changed, still consistently oily and expensive."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,27-Nov-18,My biggest regret is that I did not get the larger size. I love rice in general but this rice has been one of the tastiest rices I've had in my life. I could eat this for DAYS. The hot sauce is also pretty good with it and the chicken is moist and delicious. I tried the same dish from a few stalls down but this was so much better.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,11-Feb-19,I thought I would love this since it was very highly publicized as a must try by almost every Vlogger and travel/food channel hosts. I was excited yet skeptical. I was right being a skeptic after all. Food was ok although very bland and simple for my taste. I understand it is a traditional dish although not my cup of tea. It was an experience.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,12-Apr-19,I came here at 9:53am and they were already serving us. Yelp says they open at 10 so I was glad they open early. Chicken is very delicious and flavorful. It was soo good we came back at night for dinner but they were already closed.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,26-Jul-20,"I have liked chicken rice for a long time, this is one of the nicer ones. Good and considered cheap, is a must-try! You can also buy other things in the hawker center too like drinks with the chicken rice!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,20-Jun-19,"My first time to have chicken rice, but it was good. Its a simple dish, chicken breast with no bones over a bed of rice. Lite and flavorful. The maxwell house is outside but covered with fans. Added a lime drink from the stall across the way"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,2-Sep-15,"As many others that travel to Singapore, Tian Tian is probably on the top of their list of must try restaurants/food stalls. A local friend recommended Tian Tian (or Ah Tai if the line was too long here) so naturally I knew I would be stopping by. We had originally planned on stopping by for either lunch or dinner on Monday but after checking their business hours, we noticed they were closed that day. Seeing how we were leaving on Wednesday morning, we made the trek over to Tian Tian (don't utilize the map location on yelp as it takes you to the wrong place as this is hawker stand is inside the Maxwell food center) for an early dinner.  It was a super muggy/hot evening so we opted to take the food back to the hotel to enjoy in an air conditioned room. We were lucky to find a short line and were in and out within 5 minutes. We ended up ordering their half chicken along with two orders of rice and an order of their bean sprouts. To our surprise, the portions were huge!!! We only ended up eating 3/4 of the chicken and maybe about 3/4 of the rice. One draw back about taking the food to go is that they didn't include the ginger oil and also some sweet soy sauce which is what we are accustomed to having along with our Hainan chicken rice. Though the chicken was super tender, I didn't think the rice was that aromatic or flavorful. Despite being disappointed with the rice, Tian Tian was 1/4 the cost of our dinner at Chatterbox. I think the perfect Hainan chicken dinner would be the chicken at Tian Tian and the rice from Chatterbox.  Tian Tian is still a must try when visiting Singapore, but I think I'll try other places before coming back again."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,25-Jul-19,"this was an unquestionable requirement visit goal on our Singapore schedule, Michelin featured Hainanese Chicken Rice. I have observed each YouTube video on this dish.  Situated in a seller like setting, be set up to perspiration slugs. We chose to go around evening time. Once inside this zone, with slow down after slow down of open kitchen, you will feel the warmth. It's more sizzling than outside. The line is long however it moves quick. Truth be told, I am not used to these conditions. As my child and I snatch a table with outsiders, we hold up with the huge fans above blowing at us with no help. As the dishes are put before me, I can tell how delicious and succulent the dim meat looks.  What I didn't exactly expect was the bizarre thick covering everywhere throughout the chicken. I don't know what that is but rather I delve in. It is past delicate and the skin on the chicken was extremely sleek. Once more, I was somewhat pestered by that thick covering. As I take each chomp, it was difficult to eat as the huge fans continued blowing my hair and stalling out against my sweat-soaked face.  I needed to ensure I wasn't eating my hair and the chicken simultaneously. Shockingly, I've had more fragrant chicken rice than this previously. It's still great however nothing unique. With everything taken into account we did delighted in the supper. The strategy where they rapidly poach their chicken works. Had I have eaten it in an a lot cooler condition, I may have made the most of my dinner better.  Extremely Nice Experience of the day here..!!!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,15-Apr-16,"Came to Maxwell Road Hawker Centre right before lunch time to stand in line for Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice. Honestly the queue was about 15 min. max as it moves very very quickly (even though the line wrapped around the stall). Sorry I can't remember the price in USD, but I'm sure it's under $10.  I kinda knew what I was going to get into. Fragrant oily rice and soft boiled chicken with skin. Garlic/ginger spicy sauce and dark soy sauce to mix together. What can I say, I'm not a huge fan of boiled room temp. chicken. Now deep fry that bad boy and we talkin' about a real GOOD meal! lol j/k.  One persons opinion doesn't really mean much. My palate is not the same as anyone else's, so we all have to try out dishes for ourselves, right? How about I share some pics."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,13-Nov-18,"I wasn't expecting my taste buds to react the way that they did when I tried this place. I've had hainanese chicken before but most definitely none like this. This stall was located in Maxwell's hawker center and was really easy to spot. It had a line but it moved quickly. Like I said, I wasn't expecting much cause how different can steamed chicken taste? But after one bite I realized how juicy and flavorful it was! Even the rice was really good! I wish I could find a place this good in So Cal. But for the time being, I'll be drooling over this picture till then."

One you enter the Hawker Center (Large covered area that houses many food stalls/carts) you will immediately see the longest line originating from this spot. Is it the best food under the roof...or just the spot a someone made famous???....get in there and find out for yourself.  I personally loved the dish. It was quickly prepared, very affordable (cheap) and most importantly...delicious!  We got the simple ""Chicken Rice"". It comes with fresh cut chicken, atop well cooked rice, with some cucumber slices and a spicy side of sauce (and i do mean spicy!!).  The dish was simple and the flavors were not over the top (save that sauce) but it really appeals to the palate. Add the sauce for a fiery kick!  If you find yourself in Singapore...make the hike to this spot to try the dish of the country."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,31-Mar-16,"Amid the sea of hawker stalls that make up the Maxwell Road Food Center, one stands out to even the casual observer. It alone has a line/queue. Apparantely Tian Tian has people waiting for its food virtually all the time. I visited during what I thought would be a between-meal lull in foot traffic, around 4PM, and sure enough there were still about 10 people waiting ahead of me. No other stall in the Center had a queue.  The reason is obvious after you taste their Chicken Rice. How they infuse so much flavor into the chicken meat from a boiling/steaming cooking process is remarkable. The bowl of clear broth that comes with it has a similar flavor and is quite nice. The ""Vegetable with Oyster Sauce"" dish that I also ordered was surprising delicious: baby bok choy infused with thse same wonderful flavors found in the chicken. And all of it came to a little over S$6.00 (US$5.00) for food quality that many much more expensive Asian restuarants can't match.  [A hint for fellow tourists: hawker stalls like this don't provide napkins, and to use the wash rooms to clean up will cost you ten cents (exact change helps). Also Tian Tian doesn't sell beverages. For something with an Asian flair that's easily accessible to everyone's palate I recommend the sugar cane juice from the stall directly across from Tian Tian]."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,28-Dec-18,Great chicken rice. Worth waiting in line. That's about all I can say about that. A must visit place especially for Singapore visitors.

Comfort food at its best."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,5-Mar-18,"Don't get me wrong, it's very good Hainan chicken and rice, but is it worth the wait? Maybe if you're waiting for less than 15 min. Luckily when I was here, I arrived as it opened at 11AM and there was no wait. It seemed they have a pretty good speedy, efficient system down pat, too.  Of course I got the small chicken and rice plate. As someone that grew up eating chicken and rice very frequently as a quick meal my grandmother or father would throw together, I thought it was too overhyped for me. I can imagine as someone who doesn't eat it frequently at home, it's pretty darn good still. Fragrant fluffy rice packed with umami and juicy well cooked chicken....definitely delicious. But my preference is still grandma's chicken and rice."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,23-Jan-18,"LOVE IT. Worth the queue. 11/10 one of the best chicken rice vendors in Singapore, and perhaps the world.  The rice is fragrant and fluffy. Not overcooked; you can taste and feel the individual grains as you shove each spoonful into your mouth - no kidding. The steamed chicken is flavourful, tender, and melts in your mouth. The chilli sauce (with ginger) complements both chicken and rice perfectly, adding a tantalising kick to every bite. And you have the option to order some steamed oyster-sauce veggies as a side, if you feel the need to be healthy amidst the amazing hawker fare in Singapore.  All-round satisfying dish. Pair your chicken rice with 'sugar cane juice with lemon' (from any stall in Maxwell market) to make this the quintessential Singaporean meal.  Side note: Drooling as I type this review. Need to planning my next visit to Tian Tian!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,12-Apr-15,"This may be a case of YMMV but I found this place to be overrated.. mayb it's because of the constant demand, countless bowls of chicken rice are served continuously! There was a line that wraps around the corner when I first came and there still was a line after I finished eating.  The chicken rice... hmmmm it wasn't fragrant at all! It was cold and hard. Not what I'd expect. Thumbs down on the rice for me...  The chicken.... hmmm I found it to be course and dry in the breast area and the leg was nice and silky. I didn't mind it actually. But to claim as the best ... I doubt it... I've had so much better in Shenzhen and also in Melbourne. this is my experience only .. Give it a go still.. it may be different for you.. at least it is one to cross off the list."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,1-May-17,"I was in Singapore for 24 hours (it was an amazing layover). When I was in Singapore, I made it a goal to try Singapore's most famous and iconic dish, Hainanese chicken and rice. Every guide book and every local has told me that, this is definitely the spot to try it.  Now, I'm an exchange student in Thailand right now (in Bangkok to be exact). Hainanese chicken and rice is also very popular here and it's the place where I tried it for the first time. It's very delicious and very cheap in Thailand (it costs less than 2 US dollars).  With that being said, I was really looking forward to trying it in Singapore, the home of this iconic dish.  When I arrived, I was happy and sad to see a line. Happy because it means the food is great and sad because it means I'll have to wait.  I eventually got it and I have to say, it's very good!!! But, I'll be honest, the Hainanese chicken and rice I've had in Bangkok tastes better. But the Hainanese chicken and rice in this restaurant is still great and it's definitely worth a visit when you're in Singapore"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,29-May-16,"Tian Tian seemed to be made popular by Anthony Bourdain so I had to try it. Overall, I'd say it was good. Would I return? Likely, If I were showing guests around since this restaurant has gained popularity because of Bourdain and that's why people want to try it out.  Chicken was moist and flavorful as people say. Rice had good flavor as well. The sauce provided was good but I like the chicken rice meal on its own. $3.50 for a small.  If you're with a group, order a whole or half and share.  I'd say that other places are just as good without the hype. Also, then you don't have a wait even though this line at Tian Tian moves give or take quickly.  Tip: have your $ ready because they try to hurry you along Tip2: expect a line and to wait at least a little"

It was early, a bit past 10am and we were hungry. Looking through the stalls we saw this one, that was first of all open and operating at this hour, also had a few people lined up.  We ordered medium size chicken and rice. The rice was so tasty! Loved it. Steamed chicken was okay. Then we read that this place was recommended by Antony Bordain, hence group of European looking tourists in the que.  For 3 SGD it was perfect! The Maxwell Center has a lot to offer too, so we ended up trying the oyster cake and a sugar cane drink.  Coming back tonight to try the ramen from one of the stalls."

They have it down to a science (i.e. efficient), so make sure you take a look at the menu before you get to the woman who takes your order (pay in one place, move down the line to another place to pick up your food). I ordered:  Chicken and rice: while the chicken was moist, I think that I like the rice even more: very, very fragrant chicken smell and taste  Bok Choy in oyster sauce: while this was good, it was actually more expensive than the chicken and rice itself. Next time, I would skip the veggies and fill up with other good food in this centre.  Overall, Tian Tian met my expectations, but I wouldn't say that I was blown away. Still, it's probably a must-eat while in Singapore for tourists."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,31-Jul-17,"TIP: Avoid the long lines by going early. They open at 10am.  So what's the verdict? Is it worth the hype?! I would say it met expectations.  I love me some hainan chicken rice. I only have Savoy from Monterey Park to compare it to.  I was pleasantly surprised to not be disappointed. The chicken was tender. The sauce was the perfect amount of spicy. The rice was oh so fragrant and brothy. It helped that we didn't have to wait long for the food. The short line at 10:30am on a Saturday moved very quickly.  My only gripe, is that I wish the portions were bigger!! I want more! Wahhh :(  To get the most popular dish, ask for chicken rice( only comes in medium size) for only 5 SGD!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,9-Apr-19,"I mean. It was okay? I was surprised. a ""large"" wasn't very large, it was drenched in whatever sauce contains peanuts. A little is okay but I thought it was kind of overpowering. But I also don't like peanuts that much so take my opinion on that with a grain of salt. Vegetables and broth did not come with it like most sets in Singapore. The broth is my favorite part so I was bummed about this! The sauce was also SUPER FUCKING SPICY. I like the ginger/garlic sauce more than the spicy red stuff. So maybe this will be good to other people, but I personally wouldn't wait in line for it again when literally a million other places serve the same thing WITH broth :)"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,20-Jul-17,"I'm no expert regarding Hainanese chicken rice. I just know that this chicken rice was really good. Good enough to want to eat every day (but I don't because I need to try other stuff before I leave). The chicken itself is simple- tender, and provided with a tasty chili sauce on the side.  Simply good. Go during off hours so that you don't have to cue. Both times I've been there in the mid-afternoon hours 2pm-5pm, there haven't been lines. Maybe I just got lucky."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,20-Dec-14,"5 stars can not even describe this place. I was afraid that it was overhyped since there are plenty of reviews on it and even Anthony Bourdain has eaten here. But its all true, there is no overhype. Tian Tian definitely lives up to all the hype.  The chicken plate for $4 is amazing. I've never had chicken so juicy and tender and flavorful. Just from looking at it, you can see the plumpness of the chicken meat! You can actually taste the flavor of chicken. I didn't even use the sauces as the chicken itself is the star. I didn't want any sauce to takeaway from the star of the show. I really wish LA could get their hainan chicken act together, even something half as good as tian tian would be nice to have.  And the rice is just heavenly. Rice itself is perfectly cooked: light and fluffy. The flavors of chicken have immersed itself into each grain of rice. Eaten together with the chicken, its like a party in your mouth.  I went on a weekday around 2pm, so the line definitely died down. Waited about 10 minutes before I ordered, and another couple minutes to grab the plate of food. After you get your chicken, you can grab a drink at one of the juice stalls in the area (there's one directly across from tian tian).  I'm salivating just writing this review. I want some Tian Tian hainan chicken rice!!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,20-Feb-15,"I'm hoping this is the one located at Maxwell Center in Chinatown!  This spot is especially popular because their chicken and rice beat Gordan Ramsay at a competition. Rightfully so because the chicken (non-broiled) was tasty requiring no sauce (or ketchup for that matter). It did come with an orangey-chili sauce for additional dipping if you choose. The rice was fragrant and went well with the chicken.  Wait was not long at all, most likely because I went in the afternoon, after the lunch rush."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,15-May-15,The best chicken rice in the whole world! It's even worth to come here when you have just an stopover at Singapore airport. It takes about 40 minutes taking the MRT from Changi to get here. Just hop of at stop 15 and go down maxwell road. What you see is what you get: chicken and rice ;) This dish is so tender and flavored! You will love it!
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,30-Sep-17,"Yikes. The hype from this place is overwhelmingly high but the chicken unfortunately doesn't live up to my standards. Chicken is my favorite meat and this place, I didn't even want to finish my small order. I didn't taste much chicken flavor in the rice, the chicken meat was mushy and I had to wait in line for this plate of sadness. Is this what chicken rice is supposed to taste like?"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,9-Dec-14,This place is overhyped. The chicken rice is average. The line was pretty long when I arrived at around 1230 on a weekday but the stall uncles were very efficient and the line moved very fast.  Chicken meat: abit dry. Texture is not great. Rice: fragrant and moist Chilli sauce: good! Typical chicken rice chilli sauce  The chicken rice is drizzled with some sauce and the sauce is too salty. You can probably request to not have the sauce.  Also the soup was not provided till asked. Soup is very bland.  The stall owner also requested for us to hold the plates in our hands instead of using the trays to hold the plates. (I went with a friend and we had bought 2 plates).
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,30-Mar-18,"The good: Flavor & aroma of the rice,price, friendliness (given how busy they're & it's street food)  Not so good: lineup (mine was 10 mins, which is ok I guess, but that was at 5:30pm)  Verdict: No reason to suffer from FOMO if you can't make it, there is plenty good chicken rice around Singapore (though the rice might not be as flavourful, almost as good) that deliver a great overall (taste of the entire dish) experience."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,6-Mar-15,"It was as if clouds took rice form and were cooked in an amazing broth of just right seasoning - that is what the rice is like from TianTian. Having first tried the chicken rice in Chinatown, I had an ""okay"" benchmark of what it could be compared to. This little hawker stall (or rather two hawker stalls) lived up to the hype.  The rice was flavorful, fragrant and indeed was eaten by itself for a few moments before realizing there was a half chicken waiting to be consumed also. Paired with the soy and chili sauce, the chicken and the rice worked together wonderfully, and left me to wonder if this was better than 53rd and 6th's own Chicken and Rice. My conclusion: it holds its weight.  A must-try if visiting Singapore. Not just because a celebrity chef said so, but because food should be considered a way to get to know a new culture intimately. And with this simple dish, you definitely feel at home, even thousands of miles away."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,1-Sep-14,Forget what Anthony Bourdain said - all he did was overhype the chicken and rice and create a crazy long line out the door. I stupidly waited like a gullible fool for an ordinary dish that I could have gotten anywhere. At least it was cheap - only $3.50 SGD for a plate of mediocrity.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,5-Jan-18,"No Frill, No gimmick, Just good ol Hainanese Chicken Rice! Service can be spoty, some people pay for different price... 3.5 vs 5 sgd with no size difference.... But oh well, they have good food. Chicken Rice is fragrant, pillowy and fluffy. Chicken was soft, perfectly cooked and the chilli sauce complement the dish very well."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,3-Jul-18,"Chicken from Hainan, cooked well in Singapore. The spot is popular. When I came there had been a long line.  One thing I first noticed was there were no bones and the dish was pretty convenient to eat. The rice is cooked in chicken stock, it was infused, altogether cast over with lovely chicken flavour, so eating it alone brought a great pleasure. The meat was tender, was breaking apart by slightly being stirred about. Tender and juicy. Also, the ginger garlic and spice dipping sauce goes well with it.  The dish can't be likened to the Hainanese chicken I had back in Toronto."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,7-Apr-18,Awesome Chicken and Rice. The rice is delicious. Deep fried prawn was also very good. I highly recommend.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,23-Aug-17,Very popular place with long line. This place has pretty solid chicken rice but definitely not the best I've ever had. Rice had good flavor. Chicken could have been juicer and more flavorful. Don't really understand what the hype is about.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,13-Feb-18,"A phenomenal plate of fragrant rice and succulent chicken. Don't be tricked by the knock off stalls with similar branding, and don't fear the very fast moving queue. One of Singapore's iconic dishes - and for a reason."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,29-May-15,"Really cheap eat! We had ordered a chicken rice to share! And the only thing we did wrong was not ordered an extra rice to go with it! As I'm not a big meat eater, all I wanted was the rice! The rice was so flavourful! Definitely worth the hype to come here! We were lucky and showed up just before the crowd!  Can't wait to come back!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,10-Nov-19,I stood in this crazy long line...and it was worth it! I've had hainanese chicken at different places in Singapore and they all pale in comparison to this place. The best.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,22-Sep-17,"I don't know they take bland looking chicken and rice and turn it into a masterpiece. I won't lie I took some convincing once I saw the picture that, let's say not appetizing. But after seeing the line of the locals we decided to join in suit. The wait is most definitely worth it as it's the most flavorful chicken and rice and the hot sauce sets it over the top! The chicken is well seaSoned and cooked/stewed and the rice compliments it with a salty chicken taste! Don't make the mistake I almost did and try this place! It's rated by Anthony Bourdain"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,30-May-14,"I'm going to say this is the best chicken rice I've ever had. EVER.  On a recent trip to Singapore I visited twice in a 36 hour period and now compare every other chicken rice meal to Tian Tian.  The lines may be daunting, but they move quickly and the staff here move swiftly to fulfil orders and have you on your way with mounds of steaming rice, silky chicken, perfectly balances chili sauce and broth in moments. Put a member of your group in line while the others hunt down drinks and a table."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,15-Nov-19,"5 stars for the rice, 1 star for the chicken. Man that bird is wack, I don't see what people are raving about. It is so bland and some of my pieces were actually cold to the point I nearly gagged. The rice is awesome though. That rice with good chicken would be quite the dish."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,31-Jan-14,"I was all about chicken rice @ Tian Tian the entire time I was in Singapore. When I finally had the chance to try it out, it just turned out to be A-OK. The chicken was fine but the rice was a bit hard -- one notch away from the uncooked categorization. I ended up getting chicken rice three stalls down at Ah Tai, which I liked so much better. It was what I thought the experience would have been like.  And oh, maybe it's just me ... but I thought it was weird being forced to stare at Anthony Bourdain's picture while I was standing in line. The hype train is strong."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,24-Nov-16,"There is no better way to describe this place than: overrated  I know there are a significant number of rave reviews but to me this is just another stall that does not meet the hype and is exaggerated by the Anthony Bourdain visit.  During my very first time here, the queue extended all the way around the corner of Maxwell but luckily moved at a fairly decent pace (waited about 30 mins).  I ordered the smallest portion at $3, just to get a taste. While the rice is definitely soft and fragrant, the chicken was flavorless... and cold. I've never received chicken and rice in Singapore with cold chicken so assumed this was the specialty of Tian Tian, but aside from just being tender, there was nothing about the way this dish was served that marked it as something I'd come out of the way for.  The second time I came here was out of my boyfriend's interest to try and had the exact same experience. Personally, definitely not worth the wait in the queue (although give it a try if you're lucky enough to not have to wait). I'd say you can very easily have a much better meal at another stall at Maxwell."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,22-Dec-19,"Order the hainanese chicken. Many claims to be the original and tries to use similar names at this food court. The competition among food vendors are very fierce. Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken is the only one with the lines. The chicken is so tender and silky.  The place can be very hectic. Securing a table to eat is another trick Look for people almost done eating and then hover next to them. Look mean so that you will not be pushed out. The other day this guy tried to take my table, and t told him to back off. and he just moved on."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,22-Sep-19,"We heard so much about this place, it was hyped up by food bloggers, yelp, trip advisor, Travel Chanel, friends/colleagues, you name it... if you mention Singapore food to anyone.. it's almost a guarantee they will mention this place... so there you go, our expectations were already set high for this place... and so we went around 10:10 am - just when they opened, our cab dropped us of directly at the place, we got inside and noticed immediately the line to queue up, it was not too long.... yet, so we got to the end of it and people were already steadily lining up as well behind me.. a lot.., but the line was moving fast enough anyways so didn't wait that long (maybe 15 minutes top).. we got to ordering up and they were quick and efficient, probably years and years of experience, we both got the chicken rice, sat on our tables and began eating... it was tasty but the chiken was cold, now we don't know if it's supposed to be like this, and if it is then disregard my gripe, but to me it took down the experience of eating the food down several notches.. For the hype this place got.. it was disappointing to us, don't get me wrong it was good, the flavors were there, with a simple but clean presentation... but to me the meal itself lost points when it was cold and not hot.. that's just my honest opinion.. it's true that sometimes rarely a hyped up place lives to its expectations... and I guess to us this was one of those places... but don't let my review discourage you from trying it out, it's sill one of those travel foods you just got to try out yourself."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,29-May-17,"Review for Nov2016 - Touted as one of the best places for chicken rice, I'd say I was a little disappointed, and unfortunately they also ran out of dark meat. However, was a good first spot for chicken and rice in Singapore."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,8-Feb-17,"Came here straight after trying the now infamous soya sauce chicken and rice hawker stand and I prefer this one. I know they are completely different in taste but the wait here is much much shorter (it was also past lunch time when I came) and I think the chicken is equally as tender.  The dish here also isn't swimming in oil like the other place and just had clean simple flavors. I've been here 2 years ago and it was just as good then as it is now. Just a word of advice, ask them if you want to get more sauces because they do not like it when you go and try to serve yourself another dish of it."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,25-Nov-19,"Chicken and rice was good but lady was so mean. Better service and same food few stalls down at ah tai chicken. Over hyped, and more expensive for the same amount of food."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,20-Mar-14,"I was told that I absolutely had to try this place in Singapore, so my friend and I stopped by the hawker center to give it a try. Yes, the line is long, but don't worry, it moves pretty quickly. Before you get in line to order, it's good to walk around the hawker center and browse at what other folks are eating. Look at the plates to identify which stall the food comes from. This will give you a better understanding about the food options they have - whole chicken, half chicken, single serving with rice, veggies, etc.  Since my friend and I were trying lots of different stalls for lunch, we ordered a single serving for each of us. The chicken is super soft and smooth, definitely not something you can find in the states. Who can complain about $3.50 for chicken, rice, and soup?"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,17-Jan-20,Queue to this place was CRAZY I thought it's going to be awesome. Ended up I got plain tasting chicken with very starchy meh sauce. Rice was good - fragrant but that's about it.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,24-Jan-14,Very good chicken rice here. Try the half chicken and rice. Be sure not to let the cool chicken broth with the half chicken go to waste. I think it tastes best poured onto the rice. Love the garlic chili sauce.  I'm learning that there really isn't a "best chicken rice" in Singapore. There's either Chicken Rice made properly or chicken rice not made properly.  It is made very properly here. Comfort food at its finest.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,22-Dec-14,"I mean, it's a legend for a reason. This was my first chicken and rice experience (but not my last), and I'll remember it fondly.  The chicken itself was moist and tender. Not the highest of quality (I feel Heng Ji at Chinatown is higher quality), but not poor by any means. The rice certainly shines, and was delicious.  Was here on a Saturday evening and the line wasn't too long. The food centre wasn't too busy either and I got a table no problem."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,24-Apr-15,"Located inside the Maxwell Food Court, just a short walk from the Chinatown MRT station. Long line, so the best time to go is before lunch or after the lunch hour crowd. The line moves very fast and the service very efficient and organized. The Chicken is very moist, tendet and juicy, the rice fluffy and perfectly seasoned. The Bean Sprout was cooked just right. Must definitely try the Tian Tian Chicken Rice is you are in the area, or when visiting Singapore. Simple dish, but so good. Great to have a good quality meal at a very affordable price. Highly recommended."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,29-Apr-13,"If you're a fan of Anthony Bourdain and his show ""No Reservations,"" then you've probably heard of Tian Tian and their famous chicken rice. When I first came to Singapore, my #1 to do was to eat chicken rice from Tian Tian and their stall in Maxwell food centre.  I popped in real early as I wanted to beat the queue. As soon as the stall opened, I was first in line. I ordered the standard chicken rice set and after 1 minute of waiting, a serving of chicken, rice, soup and garlic chili sauce was waiting for me. After I found an empty table, I threw some garlic chili on top of my dish and dug in. The moment the mix of chili, rice and chicken hit my tongue was like ecstasy. It was as if I had lost my virginity all over again (okay, maybe not quite the same).  Plenty of time has passed after my first time there, and I can proudly admit that I've eaten the chicken rice there at least 20 more times after that. Whenever I have visitors, I always make sure to take them to Tian and Tian and have them experience it for themselves. It's a must."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,28-Dec-17,"Visited this place for late lunch and had the half chicken with chicken rice. It was very delicious! Probably the best chicken rice I have eaten during my visit. The chicken was steamed nicely, soft and succulent and the rice was fragrant and tasty. Because it is in a Hawker Centre, be prepared for the Hawker ambiance. No air condition, crowded, share tables and long queues. But worth it to try the chicken rice!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,15-Sep-13,"First, the hainanese chicken is wonderful. However the time waiting in line isn't worth the differential to other hainanese chicken you can get elsewhere. Put another way, it's good but you can get something pretty comparable elsewhere with no wait at the same price or cheaper.  Very good food but seems a bit overhyped in my opinion."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,23-Mar-13,"This was this was the only stall that had a line, a long long line. I imagine that this is partly because of the celebrity hype and advertising. Nevertheless, I waited. It was good. The chicken was tender and the rice was flavorful. Was it worth the wait? Not really sure. There were other stalls selling chicken rice that looked the same, however, there were locals waiting for the TianTian. I asked one guy in line and he assured me this was better than the others.  For S$5, I got a huge plate of rice and chicken with a few slices of cucumber and sauces, plus a bowl of broth. All in all, a really good filling meal for a small amount of money. Try the fried bananas at stall next row over, delicious."

There are two sections of the store. One for paying and order bigger plates, the other one collection.  All I could say is yum!! The rice has interesting flavours and the chicken was tender - well-cooked. I was impressed by the overall deliciousness of the chicken rice.  This is a must try place. Especially for tourist :)"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,5-Mar-17,"I still crave this in my sleep. Visited my hometown this summer after several years and the first thing I craved was chicken rice. The national dish of Singapore, and rightly so, its chicken is tender, the rice is cooked with the broth and all the sauces (ginger and dark, sweet soy sauce) must be eaten together to get the best out of the meal. Tian Tian is famous for having one of the best chicken rice, but honestly everywhere around Singapore you can find a delicious plate of chicken rice. Too bad it's hard to find here in California :("
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,23-Jun-19,Delicious Hainanese chicken and rice. The menu appears simple but quite delicious. Coming from the US we are used to large portions so you may have to order two plates to get your fill. It comes with ginger sauce and soy sauce for dipping. A must try while you are here!
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,16-Aug-19,"Years ago, you could call in advance to order your chicken rice, it would wait for you by the time you reach the (now closed) car park. Forget that now, and be prepared to queue. It's pretty efficient, but still takes anywhere between 10 minutes (at opening at 10am, or mid afternoon) and 45 minutes (meal times). The prices are the highest among all the Hainanese chicken rice stalls at Maxwell (although that's still most reasonable) ; they only give out the chilli and dark soy sauces upon request (although that is very much part of the dish!). So, is it worth it? If you're not a foodie, the answer is ""hell, no!"" On the other hand, if you can tell subtle differences in the texture of the chicken, the fragrance of the rice, or the degree of kick in the chilli sauce, or if you just line up servings from the various chicken rice stalls at Maxwell (Tian Tian, Ah Tai, Heng Heng), you would have to say ""this is the best lah!"""
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,20-May-18,"When we showed up to the Maxwell Centre yesterday afternoon, we saw a long line and worried that it might be for Tian Tian...and we were right. That said, the line itself, while looking a bit daunting, moves along relatively quickly - after all, how long can it take to serve a bunch of chicken rice? We ended up getting to the front of the line in about 20 minutes' time - not too bad - and we were served shortly thereafter. Unless you are really full already, I would go with a large, which, in all honesty, is not that large to begin with. Once we found ourselves a table, we chowed into the famous chicken rice - and in all honesty, it is pretty good, but it was not quite as 'amazing' as waiting in line might make you expect. The chicken is flavored well, although the sauce is a bit on the light side. I really do enjoy the cilantro here, but the quantity of leaves is pretty small. Speaking of quantity - the amount of chicken is also a bit less than I would expect, and with the pieces served with bones in them, you do have to work your way around it to get the meat off - no small feat when you have no napkins and no knives to help with. The rice is really well-flavored on its own - I could probably just eat that as a standalone - and the combination of the marinated chicken with the rice makes it easy to understand why it's so popular.  So why the average rating? As I mentioned, the quantity of food was a bit low. For S$7.80, it's not a bad deal...but consider when we decided to give Tong Fong Fatt (a few stalls down a whirl)...it's no contest - their chicken is better, you get more of it (as well as soup), it is cheaper to boot, and perhaps best - there's no line. So despite the accolades that Anthony Bourdain and all the other testimonials say, the food here is certainly good - but it's not even the best version that is available amongst the rest of the hawker stalls."

Cold tender, if not a tad gelatinous, chicken is a little challenging for my western pallet, but I dig it. The rice is worthy of a dish on its own.

Must be because we eat during off-peak times but better for us because it made me love this place even more! They give a generous portion of chicken which is way it wins in the chicken rice war. Love the ginger sauce as well. I add the thick soy sauce to the rice and mix it together. Yum! One of my favorite meals in Singapore.

Situated in the famous Maxwell Hawker market, it wasn't too hard to find. Yes, just look for the stall with the longest line. With about 27 people in front of me, I decided to just take a number and fall into line.  When it was time to order, the register lady was Soup Nazi like and there were signs instructing how to order and to get your cash ready. Puleeze... I got the half chicken and chicken rice.  First mistake - I had to ask for soy sauce. Second mistake - They did not provide a fresh ground ginger oil condiment. Third - The chicken and rice tasted just okay. Not mind blowing,"

When we visited Maxwell Center, there were numerous Hainan chicken joints inside. But none of them had nearly as long of a line as Tian Tian did!  Though it's a typical small sized stall that you'd expect at any hawker centre in Singapore, they've got enough manpower that the division of labor with such little space is impressive! Order after order is rolled out so efficiently that your mouth just waters as the queue gets shorter.  If it's 2-3 of you, I highly suggest grabbing half a chicken and 3 rice bowls! Soup is included, along with all the condiments (it's not Hainan chicken without all the sauces)! The chicken is so damn succulent that you'll want to eat it until the very last bit of meat (and veins) that you're nearly close to the bone marrow!  If you know some Chinese (or getting a bit rusty), this is your chance to speak it as some of the ladies passing you the food don't know too much English (maybe some Singlish though, haha).  And don't forget to snap a picture of the food porn before you start digging in!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,25-Nov-17,"Large hainanese chicken rice isn't much larger than the medium. Chicken was a little cold and was pretty bland, even with the chili sauce. Overrated... Don't listen to Anthony Bourdain in this case."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,8-Nov-15,"They occupy two stalls. First stall (the corner one) is to take order and make payment. Then you proceed to the 2nd stall to pass them your receipt. Verdict? There are better ones out there. This is too overrated. Chicken is dry but generous amount. Rice is so so. But chilli tasted pretty fresh. Tangy and spicy. ;) On the whole, didn't expect this much hyped chicken rice to taste so (less than) mediocre."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,9-Jan-17,"Just another hawker stall? Nope. This one has been knighted by Anthony Bourdain. The 20+ minute lines will tip you off that this chicken and rice joint is something special. But how's the food? The Hainanese chicken is just ok. But nearly all of this type of chicken is just ok because it's all about the rice and sauce. The meat is smooth, evenly cooked, relatively clean (devoid of fatty sinews and bone spurs) for this type of chicken. The rice is very good, but not bursting with flavor as the pro chef's review suggests. Still, its soft, juicy, and fragrant. This stall's orange colored sauce is legitimately hot. Not as hot as something like, say, a Halal Guys red sauce in Manhattan, but still quite heated. FYI: The Singaporeans do not seem to rock the ginger, green onion sauces that them Cantonese folks like. Overall it's about average and it makes wonder if I should be letting a ""gwai lo"" (in Cantonese) tell me what is good Chinese food."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,7-Sep-15,Located inside Maxwell's Food court is a gem. There are so many hawker stands it is hard to figure out which one to visit. A must visit if you want authentic Hainan Chicken rice. The staff is super nice! They are very honest and helpful. We asked for a whole chicken thinking it would be small portions but the lady asked how many people will be eating. When we said two she said half chicken is more than enough. The rice is super flavorful! We ordered to go and the one complaint I had is they did not pack any ginger sauce. When I think of Hainan Chicken rice I think ginger sauce and yummy rice. For me the star of the dish is the rice. Need to add the ginger sauce. The chicken was juicy and tender. We ordered bean sprouts ans that was delicious!! It tasted very much like home cooked meal. Amazing!!! Cannot wait to go back. This time I will make sure I get the ginger sauce.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,4-May-14,"Who would have thought that a dish so simple could be so delicious and comforting. Had to try some Hainan chicken rice after watching Anthony Bourdain on No Reservations rave about Tian Tian! Luckily our hotel was literally walking distance right across from the Maxwell food court so I was ready to eat this every single day it was that delicious!! For $3.50 Singapore dollars which was basically equivalent to ~$3 US you get a pretty decent portion of chicken and rice plus a bowl of the chicken broth. The rice smells heavenly. The chicken is moist but pretty bland by itself. However, it's all about mixing the chili sauce and brown sauce with your chicken! My goodness! There is usually a line so be prepared for a wait but there at Tian Tian the service is pretty fast! Definitely a must have while visiting Singapore!!!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,29-Feb-16,This is definitely the best Hainan Chicken I've ever had. I ordered 2 drum stick chicken with rice (I like the dark meat) and a plate of veggies. The chilli sauce really gives it an extra pizzazz. Queue was long but it moved quickly. I liked it so much I came back for another meal the day I was leaving.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,14-Sep-16,"Not sure what the hype is about, I found it A-OK. The rice wasn't the best and most fragrant I've tasted, and neither was the chicken, which I honestly found too oily. They sell out towards the tail end of the evening so come early if you want your fix."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,2-May-19,"Overhype.  Firstly guys, this is Michelin BIB GOURMAND. NOT MICHELIN STAR, not the same.  Now that that's out of the way, actual food review. Chicken rice is decent, it's not out of this world or legendary, there are many chicken rice stores that are comparable or better. The overhyped fluffy rice is flavorful, yes. Of course it is, because it's COATED IN GREASE. It's so greasy you may use the plate to fry French fries when you're done.  In conclusion, decent chicken rice. There are better. This ones overhyped."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,30-Dec-18,Hainese chicken was delicious!  They only give the chili sauce now. We were looking forward to trying the entire experience with all 3 traditional sauces. Pricy for quarter chicken dinner.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,7-Nov-15,"I can literally eat this everyday. There may be better chicken rices out there but if you are risk adverse, then come here and take a seat--you will not be disappointed. This is a tried and true spot (even by the locals). I got a medium order and wished I had ordered a large.  Be adventurous and try the orange ginger sauce."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",1,27-Oct-18,"Wow, so sad to find out this place was such a HUGE disappointment. Cold pieces of chicken that were questionably cooked on bland rice. No lines, no wonder. I agree with another review stating that with increased popularly and demand must come increased responsibility to keep up the quality. This was so bad, I didn't finish it and had to drink beer to wash it down. Carry on to Duck Noodle Oriental Stall, their braised duck noodle was amazing and washed out the bland from my palate."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,21-Jul-15,"My cousin who lived in Singapore for a while highly recommended Tian Tian's chicken rice. So took our hungry selves for a late lunch. Was shocked to see a long line to the counter and from what I heard from my cousin, that was quite typical of Singapore, especially the good ones.  We waited in line and really hoped that the chicken rice would be worth the long wait. I saw a number of people walking with their chicken rice plates and quite honestly they didn't look appetizing at all.  Finally got the counter and ordered their much famed chicken rice. They drop a bowl of rice on the plate, some sauce in it and chicken breast slices on the top, and a few slices on cucumber on the side.  Would never imagine that something that looks so simple cab taste so good. Wow wow wow, I can't stop raving about this dish. It is so flavorful. Worth it, the long wait was totally worth it!!!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,31-Mar-19,Good to bring your overseas friends to experience real singaporean style chicken rice.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,17-Mar-18,"At the Maxwell Food Center, this is definitely the most popular stall to get lunch at. It is really good taste-wise and price-wise given how delicious and aromatic the chicken and rice is. Definitely worth the stop."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,6-Jan-14,"Hawker stalls are sort of the THING in Singapore, and this is THE place to be since Anthony Bourdain, Gordon Ramsay etc have been here.  Chicken rice was amazing. Full of flavor, rich and creamy from the chicken broth. BUT! the chicken itself wasn't spectacular - sort of slimy, and not a ton of meat, mostly bones. Boo.  My best rec? Get the chicken rice from TIan Tian, then meander a few stalls down to add some soy sauce chicken to your rice. Awwesome mix."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,17-May-16,"No doubts this will have your bucket list of ""Singapore chicken rice"" checked, while this or Chatterbox Chicken Rice might be a representative of the Chicken Rice in Singapore, it really isn't. Personally feel that even within Maxwell market, there is so many other chicken rice stalls to go to. Minus the long waiting time. Minus the expensive prices for a plate of chicken rice. Minus the inconsistent portions and tastes. Minus the hype.  Worth it or not? if your Singaporean, you know where to eat, lah. Two doors down and a similar branding appears with more value for money chicken rice. Consistently good and tastes almost 75% similar. No queue. if your not Singaporean and desperately want some Instagram worthy looking food, well here it is."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,17-Aug-16,"Since hearing the tale of how the hawkers at this restaurant famously defeated Gordon Ramsay in a cook off battle, I've been clamouring to try this stall.  Chicken rice is my favourite Singaporean dish so I badly wanted this one to blow me away. The queue was pretty intimidating around lunch time but it moved quickly enough.  The ordering process itself was bit of a nightmare. The woman at the till was very brusque and seemed more intent with moving me along. Understandable but in her haste, she ended up getting my order wrong and pointing me to the wrong collection queue (and then scolding me later for not being at the right one).  All the logistics aside, the chicken rice was good but not amazing. My chicken was tender but there were way too many bones. The rice was fragrant but again, not unexpected with a chicken rice dish at most other stalls. You also have to order your vegetables separately ($4 for a plate that can be shared between 2) which was slightly annoying since most places do everything together for a cheaper price.  Most of the people queuing up were also tourists which can sometimes be a telling sign as to whether a restaurant is more hype than substance. In this case, I am afraid it is."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,13-Apr-19,"Tian Tian's chicken are amazing. I prefer the rice in another establishment, but in my opinion, they serve the best chicken in the country. They are tender and full of flavor. Love it!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,23-Mar-16,Some of my local friends recommended me to try on a weekend instead of the weekdays to avoid the crowd. So was here on a weekend but the queue was snaking long. Oh well... it was WORTH the wait! Authentic & local.  The rice and steamed chicken was flavourful. Gotta try the chili sauce with it. Only found the chicken soup to be a tad too oily.  Try it!
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,31-Dec-18,The food is superb. Chicken was tender and juicy accompanied by the fragrant and fluffy rice.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,16-Aug-18,"Honestly I came here because of the reviews. But really I couldn't see how this place tasted any different than a regular Hainanese Chicken spot. Not sure what the big deal was, but for waiting in line for 30 mins, I expected it to be AWESOME, which it wasn't."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,2-Aug-16,"Anthony Bourdain made it a must go place to eat. It's always long queue in the morning, then closed so early when the chicken are sold out. I lived in Oasia hotel which is 3 min walk to Maxwell food court."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,19-Mar-15,"I am definitely not surprised that this place has more Yelp reviews than any other place in Singapore.  This place is heaven. NO JOKE.  I came to Singapore to eat. I wanted to try all the Hainan Chicken Rice out there. Before coming to Tian Tian, I had about 7-8 different Hainan Chicken Rice from places all over Singapore. Honestly, they were good, but NOT amazing.  I got to the stall at around 11am. There were only a few people in front of me. For two people, we shared half a chicken and rice. THE CHICKEN WAS SO TENDER AND FLAVORFUL. AND THE RICE OMG. You can literally just eat the rice by itself. It was so fragrant. All the other chicken rice we ate, we ad leftover rice, but this place, we cleaned the plate in less than 5 minutes. ALSO, the SPICY SAUCE, is sooooo amazing. I love spicy food and it had the perfect kick.  It was so good that we took two more orders to go with us to Sentosa to eat on the beach. Don't judge me!  My only complaint is that the chicken had a lot of bones. Other places made it with chicken breast and no bones so it was a lot easier to eat and less fatty.  If I ever come back to Singapore, it would be for Tian Tian, nothing else.  I MISS IT ALREADY."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,29-Aug-17,"You can easily spot where Tian Tian is in Maxwell as soon as you see a quick-moving line. Staff are brusque but efficient. $5 for chicken + rice - although my friend, who wanted to opt for vegetables instead of rice, got charged $9 even without rice. Not sure if that was a result of miscommunication or being ripped off since she was obviously foreign. Lol. The chicken rice is worth the hype, in my opinion, and the chili is AMAZING! Besides the chicken and fragrant rice, the chili that comes with Hainanese Chicken Rice is really able to make it or break it for me. In Tian Tian's case, it definitely made it :) I'll be back!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,19-Mar-15,"In Los Angeles, there's only 1 restaurant that serves a respectable hainan chicken, so that is really all I know about Hainan Chicken. On my trip to Singapore, I was determined to find one that is clearly better. After 5-6 restaurants and stands at hawker markets and food courts, I was starting to think that my go-to Hainan chicken rice restaurant in Los Angeles is as good as it was going to get (other than the fact that the price in LA is higher than that in Singapore). Luckily, I marked up Tian Tian, which is highly regarded by Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsay, and made a point to come try this.  WOW! The chicken was silky, clean-tasting yet flavorful. The rice smelled AMAZING and tasted even better. The red sauce added a special kick. My girlfriend and I devoured half of a chicken, and took 2 chicken rice plates to go! This is what Singapore is all about, and I can finally return home happy, knowing that the Hainan chicken in SE Asia is not an unfortunate hype."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,17-Mar-16,"Holy cow. Thank you Anthony Bourdain for telling the world about this place. The line is never ending, but damnnnn this place is the bomb. Once you finally get to the front, order that chicken with rice. The chicken is good but the chicken flavored rice is the star of the show....I can eat that rice ALL DAY LONG"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,11-May-16,"This was the only steamed chicken rice I tried in Singapore, so I can't say for sure that it's the best chicken rice in SG, but it was definitely quite amazing. The chicken is juicy and flavorful and I really loved the light sauce on it, which had an amazing taste. The rice is fluffy and lightly tasty. I didn't really love the soy sauce/ chili sauce to add on top, so adding those did mess up the dish a little for me but didnt' change how amazing the chicken was. It's simple and lovely and perfectly cooked - a must-have dish when you're in SG."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,20-Sep-15,Super flavorful chicken rice as recommended by many locals and other visitors. Very simple yet tasty. The garlic chili dipping sauce was a great accompaniment and I asked for the thick black soy sauce which apparently is for those in the know...luckily I have friends in the know. Long line was intimidating but it went super fast so it didn't feel long at all. Definitely recommended!
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,2-Jan-16,"Since long time ago,very famous Hainan chicken rice restaurant. Not only local,many tourists visit here."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,15-Apr-16,"Located at the Maxwell Hawker Center, this chicken rice stall may just be all hype due to Anthony Bourdain's episode in Singapore. The line for this stall is usually very long on the weekends, but I was able to go on a weekday with no wait. Yes, the chicken rice was great, juicy, and plump. However, any other chicken rice stall around Singapore has similar chicken rice that tastes just as great. It was $3.50 SGD at Tian Tian for the white chicken rice (no soup given). However, I am able to find some places around Singapore that sells chicken rice that is just as great for $2.50 SGD and they give you soup.  Give this place a try if you like, but if the line is extremely long I say you should try chicken rice at another stall."

Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,8-Oct-15,I was expecting so much from this place. Maybe because my preference is skewed and the Singapore style is different. Maybe because it was so over hyped "best hainan chicken in Singapore" and considering this is the must try place.  I got the hainan chicken and rice. The rice was okay. I the chicken was okay too. When it came out it was like warm at most. The chicken wasn't juicy and flavorful as what I expected.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,28-Oct-16,"Tasted the chicken from this stall a few times before it was recently awarded a Michelin Bib Gourmand.  The chicken was succulent, tender and juicy. In addition, the layer of fat from the skin gave this really lovely richness that complemented the meat really well. The rice was ""flaky"", and smooth enough to eat on its own.  A solid experience. No wonder it defeated Gordon Ramsay!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,5-Oct-15,"Famous for its chicken rice, that some people call the best in Singapore, it is indeed a great place to enjoy this delicious and typical Singaporean dish! All the more so as the price is very affordable price (less than 5SGD). However, I was a bit disappointed after the excellent reviews I read about it! The chicken was indeed not bad but there were little pieces of bones inside of it (I never had them in other chicken rice stalls I tried in Singapore) and the rice was not exceptional. I guess it was okay but I had better rice in other stalls, and it is still a big thing in that dish! So overall, it is a good place to eat but maybe not worth the long queue..."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,6-Mar-18,"WOW. I will fly back to Singapore just for the chicken rice dish from Tian Tian. There's so many great food in Singapore but this was the only place I made every effort to come back twice before heading back to the US. The rice, the chicken, the sauce...it's perfection! Come early to avoid the queue. I got here at around 11am and both times had less than 5 people in front of me."

Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,3-Apr-18,The chicken and rice here was delicious and at only $5 for a medium plate very satisfying. The line wasn't bad during lunch time at only about 20 minutes.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,2-Sep-17,"Ok. So this is the famous place at Maxwell food center, and it turns out this is pretty delicious cheap eats in SG. Better yet have it with some ice cold large bottles of Tiger Beer from the place facing it. Delicious."

Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,22-Jan-16,"I may not be in the majority, but while I liked the chicken rice, I wasn't falling out of my seat eating it either. It is A-OK though. Simple, warm, a slightly sweet sauce, this chicken and rice has a home-cooked taste that makes it great to eat when you're looking to fill up on a staple without much fuss. I liked it, but did not love it."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,30-Apr-15,"So I'm joining this long list of reviews to comment on the fare here. After Gordon Ramsey's tour of Singapore, this place is more popular than ever. I used to remember coming on particular days of the week (is it Monday) and the stall isn't even open at all! Seems like they dictate the terms where you guys can or cannot taste their chicken rice! Seems over-rated to me after all. I came down on a weekday evening and was pleasantly surprised that they were still open at around 8. Proceeded to order a plate... and it didn't come with soup.  The chicken is a little tough as compared to those I've eaten at other places. The chili however, is absolutely delicious. Not to hot and sweet enough for my liking. I went back to take another helping of it. Oh I didn't see them providing dark soy sauce too. The rice is absolutely normal. There were some cucumber hidden beneath the chicken.  The experience was underwhelming and I'm sure the other stalls around like Ah Tai are already biting at their heels in contending for Chicken Rice hegemony."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,6-Jan-16,"Do expect a long line as the Singaporeans all some to gather to what is supposedly the best. This is a perfect example of things not living up to the hype. The wait can be fairly long even though they work fairly fast, and be prepared that they may run out of food before you make it to the counter. The service can at best be described as efficient but a more accurate description may be half-rude. I guess they can afford to as they are so popular.  The food is chicken rice and I will admit that I do fail to see the greatness of this dish, although I have had a few decent ones. This one barely qualifies as decent as it does lack some of the freshness and also appear to use some chicken that is not the highest quality. The rice was however very fresh and tasted really nicely. There will however not be any repeat visits for me."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,4-Jun-18,"Yep! I'm a fan of there delicious Haninanese Chicken Rice, lines can get long. Go in off peek times if you can."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,2-Jul-16,"Do not be deterred by the line...it moves fast! Absolutely worth the wait. There were about 100 ppl. in line ahead of us and we still had our food in 15 minutes. Don't miss out on the vegetables in oyster sauce, in addition to the chicken and rice. Delish! There's also this coconut milk shake place across the way. Thai tea shake was perfect to sip on while standing in line for our food."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,10-Apr-17,"YUM! We went during an offtime and there was still along line!

Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,30-Aug-16,Truly one of the best Hainanese Chicken Rice in Singapore. There is just something about the chicken rice that really attracts you.  The fragrant rice will really make you crave for more. I dont know how to explain the feeling.  But its really good. TRY. IT. NOW.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,12-Aug-17,"I went there very early at 16:30 on Sat., and the queue was not so long which was just 5 min. for my turn to order. The chicken rice is the popular one on their list, esp for single tourist. I love the rice very much, but the chicken is normal (not too much diffence against others), that is why one star missing."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,12-Jul-18,"It was good, but I just can't give 4+ until I refine my ability to critique cold chicken and rice. I'm still working on this and will update as necessary. I did, however, find many other dishes at other stand that I'll be glad to offer more fine tuned reactions."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,15-Jul-17,"The best thing about this place was the flavorful rice. But other than that, I feel like I've had better chicken and for much less. The locals must know of a tastier hidden treasure because I didn't see any locals in line. A majority of the people were visitors who knew of this stall's existence because it was approved by Anthony Bourdain."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,31-Dec-17,"Came for lunch. Got the chicken and rice plate. It was okay, very simple flavors. The orange sauce that cane with had a nice spicy kick to it. Would come back and eat again"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,29-Aug-14,"I thought it was cute that Tian Tian hawker stall gave out a number along with the printed receipt. Guess they are THAT popular and famous that they have one window to pay and another to get your food, when most hawker stallls are usually a one or two man show.  The chicken rice here, along with the one in Far East Plaza, is supposedly the most popular in Singapore for chiken rice. But the blue sign hawker stall on the second floor of Golden Shoe hawker is just as good, and my coworkes and I frequent this one more often as it's right next to our work in raffles place. Can't choose! all three are good, with juicy chicken and fragrant rice. I always get the steamed chicken rice with no skin, with extra hot sauce."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,2-Feb-18,"Had to try this because it's so famous. But I much prefer Kiat Ocha Hainanese Chicken Rice in Chiang Mai, Thailand."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,2-Apr-15,"I had to go here due to the infamy gained from Bourdain. And I usually agree with his assessment. This place is good and on par with Chatterbox at 1/5 the price. Now, I have only been here since they expanded, but here's what I got: rice is more flavorful than Chatterbox but not by much. Chicken was dry and full of bones. Bourdain mentioned this was a go to spot with chicken that didn't need the sauce, but Tian Tian put it on anyway. On my visit, the chicken was dry. If you are visiting and pass through the ""foreigner"" checkpoint at Chatterbox, this is the next logical step to get an authentic Hawker table in Chinatown. If you want the best and can make your way to Yishun, Jiefuji is my top pick for best in the Island Nation.  Otherwise, this place is a solid 3.5 Stars!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,5-Aug-15,"Making a complicated dish look simple, this place earns the reputation it has because it maintains its consistency despite the pressure to accommodate long line ups every single day. Not to say there aren't other great chicken rice options in the city, or even in Maxwell Hawker itself, but this place deserves the recognition."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,21-Aug-18,It was our first time at Maxwell Food Center and from our research ahead of time we knew we wanted to try the Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice and we were very glad we did because it was delicious!!!
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,12-May-17,"It really was awfully good. I'd go more for the roast chicken and not lukewarm, but when in Rome, or here Singapore, do as they do. Using that criterion, this was near perfection."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,23-Nov-14,"Came to this well publicized Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice. In general, it's worth the trip and the taste did impress me. Price is decent, about S$4.00 per plate. Here's my two cents,  1) Rice alone taste great, lives up to it's name. Taste great to eat even by itself 2) Chicken alone is bland but texture is good, I guess the favor has gone to either the rice or the chicken oil 3) Chicken with Chicken Oil(Yes, the gravy is solely Chicken oil) taste came in great, the chicken favor are all in the chicken oil 4) Chilli sauce are not hot and has some lime and garlic. Be cautious if you hate garlic 5) Chicken + Chicken Oil + Rice + Chilli sauce = HEAVEN!!!  Lastly, expect long line..... especially during lunch time for about 30 mins"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,6-Jun-17,The chicken was really soft and the rice was flavorful. Came on a awkward time so the line was only 5 min. I'll make a trip here no matter where I am in Singapore. Worth the visit when your here
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,20-May-14,"The line for this place are ridiculous, but luckily they have a corner stall where the line can naturally curve around and form outside the Hawker Center. I don't know much about chicken rice, but with my Singaporean husband, I naturally get dragged to all the so called famous food stalls and restaurants. Tian Tian was no different, highly reviewed by Anthony Bourdain, which draws in the tourist crowd like myself, but locals eat there too. I think we must have waited for half an hour for the food, but that's probably our fault for strolling in there right at lunch time on a weekend.  After staking out my table, while the husband finally makes it through the long line, I get to try the famous chicken rice. It was delicious! It was gently cooked, which some might think is slimy, but I've never had chicken so tender. The chickens are young so therefore on the small side, but how else will you get chicken meat to be so soft if it weren't young and probably less processed then the chickens we have in the U.S. The sauces are the highlight, must douse everything in lots of sauce!  Lesson learned, try to come before 12 especially on a weekend, but I don't think crowds can be avoided here, only minimized."

Singapore's National obsession is best done here . This amazingly simple, but yet complex dish, burst full of robust chicken flavor. It has all been said before, only for those who have not been to Singapore, you cannot understand it until you have made your way to Singapore.. And in the world of chicken and rice and the lines that follow, as Yoda says, ""There is no try, only do."""
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,23-Feb-14,"It's hard to find a good plate of Hainan chicken rice in the states. The best are Savoy and Green Zone in San Gabriel. Here at Tian Tian, the food is hawker-style - no fancy platings or decorations on the dishes. Just plain good chicken and rice. The rice was very flavorful - good enough to be eaten alone - and the chicken was very tender. I usually don't like to eat the skin but with Tian Tian's, it didn't even matter. Price for a plate is about US$7 per person.  JONASAPPROVED!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,6-Dec-17,"Simply delicious!!! #1 must try place to eat if ever in Singapore. Cheapest Michelin Star restaurant I've ever ate at, probably the cheapest."

Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,7-Apr-13,"YUM!! (well until I learned how many calories are in chicken rice....)  This place was awesome. The queue was long, but worth the wait!  The rice was so flavorful and the soup perfect!  I was a little intimidated on how quickly the people were working and taking orders. Thankfully I had my fiance who spoke the language to order and pay.  I wish Singapore wasn't 25 hours away....otherwise I'd be here more!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,20-Jan-20,"This is the first hainanese chicken rice stall that doesn't give our soup, honestly, I had better chicken rice than this stall, it's so over rated. No big deal, btw stuff are incredibly rude!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,9-Mar-14,"Anthony Bourdain is either a liar, a moron, or both.  There is no way in hell the chicken rice dish is anything more than what it is - bland chicken and rice.  Luckily, I didn't have to wait long, but I would warn everyone to not waste more than five minutes to try this place. Just three stalls down, you'll find the same thing made by the same chef that used to cook the chicken for twenty years at Tian Tian.  Anyways, I ordered that drumstick ($4.20) rather than the breast ($3.50). That was a mistake because the dark meat was not fully cooked. It was rubbery, which is indicative of undercooked poultry. Dark meat takes a bit longer to cook. I returned the dish to them and asked for the breast meat. They didn't argue with me and gave me a new plate. The breast meat was indeed moist and tender, but that's about it. There's nothing going for it. The rice was whatever.  I'm not sure what Bourdain was on when he had this. He must have been high, drunk, or was just being polite.  I would pass on this stall and the wait."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,30-Jan-13,"Hiding from the torrential rains we snuck into Maxwell and gravitated to this stall like moths to a flame. God knows if Chef Sao will be able to keep up their signature dish with all the Bourdain madness lately. With no line greeting us, we happily munched on our plates of Chicken Rice, wiping our faces of condiments and bits of chicken. So good. Oh... so good.  Well worth the visit!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,18-Feb-20,"So I've honestly had better. Basically, the chicken was soggy and tasteless, though the rice has shrimp sauce --a nice touch. Would recommend to try the Hainanese stall across from it and the nasi lemak. Basically, don't just come because a bunch of pretentious fat French dudes said it was good, right?"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,4-Feb-13,"DUDE! WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS PLACE?! I kept hearing amazing things about Tian Tian from Anthony Bourdain to family members here, but I went yesterday evening and I didn't stars, I wasn't blown out of my seat, instead it was just a total let down! I've seen angels come from bright lights because of amazing chicken rice I had in Singapore (ok a little dramatic), but not by this place.  I don't care that the service sucked, I don't care that it was in a hot hawker center, I don't care that there are tons of tourists, I don't care about long lines, what I always care about is the TASTE, and I've honestly had better. What I liked though, was the price. So I guess if you happen to be in the Chinatown neighborhood, and you want cheap Chicken rice ($3.50 to be exact), it's a pretty decent option. But by no means would I say it's the best in Singapore."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,9-Jun-14,"3 stars. I didn't really need to look up online to find out where to eat at the Maxwell Food center, I just needed to find the stalls that had a line and this one definitely had a line. I enjoyed the Hainan Chicken Rice here. Ended up ordering half a chicken and boy was it large in size. Usually when you order half a chicken, you'd be lucky that it would ever come in this size. This is probably a Chicken that was fed hormones/anti-biotics or something because it was huge. Usually organic/non anti-biotics chickens don't get this big so that's just my speculation. The sauce that was drenched all over the chicken might have been a bit much, would have preferred no drenching of the chicken, it didn't add much to the flavor and it just make more wet than it needs to be. The chicken was very tender and juicy both the dark meat and the white meat. Rice was very well done full of flavor. I would definitely come here again if I'm in Singapore again for my Hainan chicken rice cravings but sadly I don't think it's the best Hainan chicken rice I've ever had. I think places in Hong Kong did a better job. But regardless if I'm in the area, I'd still come back! and yes like all stalls at a Hawker center, it's cash only!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,10-Dec-12,"I don't even like º£ÄÏëuï based on past attempts. Or so I thought, before I made an obligatory visit Tian Tian, expecting to be the lone dissenter.  Anthony Bourdain's photo plastered on the stall? Check. Huge queue before anything resembling lunch hour? Check. Serving-ware that looks like it's seen minor battle in a long forgotten war? Check.  It's good. Really good, especially the chicken stock. The combination of the chicken rice is light and still meaty enough to not have me reaching for spice.  Is it the best º£ÄÏëuï I've ever had? Yes. Is it overrated? Probably, since it cannot cure cancer and world hunger simultaneously. Should you still absolutely come here (off peak) if you're visiting Singapore? Absolutely."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,7-Dec-13,"Find a friend, go to Tian Tian, and here's what you got to do.  1. Wait in line for 30mins 2. Order half a chicken, 2 plates of rice, gizzard 3. Inhale it, and wash it down with sugarcane juice 4. Have lucid dreams for weeks  Anyone can tell you Bourdain loves it and blah blah blah, but tasting is believing. Now go on, I dare you.  Note: Closed on Mondays"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,2-Mar-15,"I think Bourdain really sums it all. ""Chicken Rice so fragrant and delicious it can be eaten on its own"". The rice is good, everything else is forgettable. What's wrong with the chicken? It is so bland - even with their special sauce. I can't help but think there must be something wrong with my palette. Maybe that's how Singaporeans and the rest of the world likes it. To me, I will take Thai chicken rice and/or Hong Kong style Hainanese chicken rice on any given day."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,5-Sep-14,"Such a simple concept, but it is so darn delicious! I had to try chicken rice after my boyfriend continuously talked about it! We made our way to the Hawker Center that Anthony Bourdain visited as well (evident by the huge photo of him by Tian Tian's stand)  It was around 5 pieces of tender chicken with chicken fat poured over it, served with white rice and hot sauce! They give you a choice between the small & large place, but by the looks of my large plate, the small one must be meant for a mouse!  Overall, great local food (even if it doesn't really constitute Singaporean food) and great taste! I wish I could have another and another and another plate..!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,13-Apr-13,"Chicken + Rice. Um.. how good can this be?  I was really, really skeptical to say the least, but it's a surprisingly good dish, and for $5 it's great value. The chicken is juicy and the rice is really flavourful, with hints of ginger.  I was told the original cook from Tian Tian left and started his own stall, Ah Tien, two doors down. So I tried them side by side, and they're about the same. I did like Ah Tien's rice a little bit better, it was a bit more fragrant but they're both more or less the same. Ah Tien has some different sauces you can try as well."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,31-Dec-15,"I haven't tried many C&R places, but this is definitely the best I've had so far. The differences are subtle, but mainly I think its the flavor of the rice and overall freshness (likely driven at least partially by the demand) that sets this place apart.  Lines can be long, but they move fast. The problem is they often run out of food."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,29-Nov-14,"the chicken is so smooth and perfectly cooked, the price point is just right but the taste a bit bland for me. i've had better hainanese chicken in the US. but it is worth the trip. we went on a Saturday prior to the lunch rush perhaps? the line wasn't too long and was very efficient. the best time is probably to show up 11a-12pm. lots of people were ordering half chickens but we wanted to try other things so we just had 2 hainese chicken dishes with rice. they also try to upsell you with a plate of veggies."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,14-Sep-14,"They're famous for their chicken and rice, supposedly in part because of Anthony Bourdain. The queue/line was long, even on a Sunday around 2:30, but moves relative quickly. And for $3.50 SGD, the chicken rice dish is probably one of the least expensive dish you can buy at this hawker center. And at that price, the serving portion (of chicken) is not particularly large... but you do get plenty of rice to fill your belly up. As for the famous chicken, the 6 or 7 slices are soft, moist and flavorful. Though I do wonder how much of that tasty flavor was from the broth they spoon on the dish before serving. I'm giving Tian Tian 4 stars... If this dish was served at another hawker stand, I would prob give it 3 stars. But eating out is never just about food alone, and factor in the whole experience of waiting in a long line along with everyone else ordering chicken rice... That deserves one more star in my opinion."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,31-Oct-19,The rice was great but I want a fan of the chicken on top. It needed some seasoning in my opinion
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,17-May-17,"The chicken rice here is quite good, but so are most of the other stalls nearby. If you're not in a hurry and like lines, go ahead and wait, but plenty other great chicken rice options in maxwell if you're in a hurry. First time I tried to go here I was new to singapore and tricked by a very similar named stall wtih a similar sign - that chicken rice was great too! Ha"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,6-Jan-20,"Based on my opinion, this place was way over-rated, and not worth any wait of more than 15 mins. We arrived at 11:30 AM on New Year Eve 2019, and the waiting line was already wrap around the building outside. Our wait was 50 mins. Chicken was juicy, tender but very bland. Rice was served under the chicken and the gravy so rice was a little too soft and too moist. The place was over crowded, we couldn't find a table nor seat, we had to eat while standing so our experience was not very pleasant since the chicken had bones and were not cut into bite size."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,5-Dec-12,"Yes, it really is that good, and yet so simple. When I went to Singapore, I thought I needed hours of research to find the food hot spots of the city. Wrong. I thought Open Table, Zagat, and Trip Advisor would sort the lot. Wrong. All you need to do is visit the ""hawker malls"" and look for the longest lines. So I qued up here not even knowing what I was ordering till I was 3rd in line. I have had this dish before and never ""got it"" till now. Tian Tian chicken is prefect as is the rice and chili sauce. It can not be describled it simply must be experienced."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,5-Oct-13,This is my absolute favorite place for hainan chicken and rice. I dream about this place. I had this a few years ago and I live to far to be able to eat it all the time. I remembered that the first day when we arrived in Singapore we ate here. I was so glad this place was literally right across the street from where we stayed. I think I ate here 3 times before we left. The chicken is perfectly cooked and the sauce that you use to dip your chicken is amazing! The rice is not oily at all either.  Tian Tian see you in a few weeks!!!
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,23-Jan-13,"Saw this place on the show 'No Reservations' with Anthony Bourdain, so of course we had to try it on our trip to Singapore. We walked a good 2.5 miles from our hotel to get here, but well worth the walk. Such a fun market place full of different foods and drinks, and across the street is the out door market place where they sell clothes and other goods. China town is one of the best things about Singapore, and so is Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice! The line is usually a bit long, and the lady there who is in charge keeps it moving (very organized). The rice is perfect and delish, and the chicken is very tender, and you will also get a bowl of Miso soup as well with your order. Make sure that you get the sauces that go with it (a spicy sauce and a thick teriyaki sauce) and your spoon and fork. The entire meal for both my husband and I was about $4.20 (American dollars). Amazing right? So glad that we tried it! So Delicious! It's a must go to when visiting Singapore!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,4-Jun-14,"i love tian tian chicken rice. i'm crazy for chicken rice.  tian tian's chicken rice is fragrant and flavorful, but not oily. their chicken is also very tender. i always get a half white chicken, rice, and the innards (gizzard and liver) and share for 2. i think i slightly prefer the one in katong, but it seems all the tian tian's are about the same consistently good quality. for me, this is the benchmark for chicken rice (of which, i am crazy about)."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,5-Sep-19,"Visited Singapore in June, and had to try this place since Anthony Bourdain had given such a high praise! I proceed to grab a tray after I ordered my dish and was told not to since I only ordered one thing, 0 point goes to the customer service. The chicken was dry and bland, rice was so so. I think they have been riding on Bordain for too long ... It was really mediocre in comparison to ""Sergeant Hainanese Chicken Rice"" in the vivo city food court (on the way to Santosa island)."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,8-Nov-13,"Indeed, there is no doubt Tian Tian earned top spot for Chicken Rice. - The chicken is succulent; The best way to figure it out is order the ""breast portion""; White meat tends to be dryer. Yet, Tian Tian manages to make it tender. - The rice, what can we say about the rice! The key to good restaurant is the rice. The rice is moist; while your chicken head back to be grind by your molar; your incisors and premolar would nicely bit on those moist rice. What a delicious blend.  People wonder, why would I give a 4 stars instead of a 5? For a food court that is not in the indoor AC, and they charge for $4.50 on my visit in Nov, 2013. It is a 50 cents to a dollar to pricey."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,10-Feb-14,"Really good.  This place requires a solid 20 minute wait, but it's pretty tasty. The chicken is super moist and tender - really great. I was surprised how plain it was. The place is really cool though and it feels very authentic. Its crazy that is only costs $3.50 for chicken rice."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,26-May-17,We came only once but BOY was it worth it! Got here early around 11am and there was a short line already and it only grew as the time went by. I would order half a chicken and separate rice if you can for a better value but the chicken are deboned and with a drizzle of soy sauce to perfect. The rice is amazing as well but it could use some ginger but that is just me.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,27-Apr-19,"Overrated and rude. I'd say they're a victim of their popularity but this feels like a self-inflicted wound. You'll find just as good chicken and rice at some of the smaller, more gracious stalls with shorter queues."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,27-Sep-13,"You'll never fail to find it. It is inside the Maxwell Food Center in the middle with the longest queue.  Chicken is so tender and juicy and rice is tasty. Also the soup is a big surprise.  The small chicken rice set is never enough for me. At least half of a chicken and a bowl of rice is enough.  Once you had it, you'll never forget. Remember to eat hot.  However, since it's just inside the Maxwell food center, it would be rather busy during rush hours. Sometimes you may have to take a little while to find a seat."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,22-Jul-14,"This place is so hyped up on the internet. Despite locals telling me not to eat here, I had to see for myself. Service/attitude was brusque. I ordered a plate of chicken rice for 3.50. They give you chili sauce (in addition to whatever sauce they pour on) but no other sauce which may have soured my experience. The chicken itself was tender but that and the rice was pretty much flavorless. The only good thing is I only waited about 5 minutes in line."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,27-Aug-13,Hainanese Chicken yummy !  This place serves up a nice flavorfull meal with local ingredients that just make it unique. The chicken i lightly seasoned and moist with hints of ginger and sesame seed oil.  I have been around and this is a pretty good dish for the price.  Its not the best but pretty close to where it needs to be.  If you are in the area do try it.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,6-Oct-14,"Tian tian is probably the most famous one among big chicken rice names in Singapore. However, my favorite one is Wee Nam Kee. Personally, I like the meat and rice qt WNK which is, to me, more tasty than ones at Tian Tian."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,26-Dec-12,"Not bad, had to try it since Mr. Bourdain recommended.  Maybe I'm just not a huge fan of hainanese chicken rice, but it was alright.  I liked the chicken better at the rival stall but the rice is nicer here."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,8-Sep-14,"I honestly don't understand why this place is rated as highly as it is. Yes the rice is very fragrant and the chili's pretty good but the chicken is rather disappointing.  Personally I think you get better chicken at Boon Tong Kee, Wee Nam Kee, or even Five Star. It really boils down to what's important for you I suppose, and although the queue wasn't that bad on a Friday afternoon (at around 3pm), the food just didn't really impress me.  I'm saying nay to Tian Tian's reputation as best chicken rice in Singapore."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,26-Jan-14,"Tian Tian does not live up to the hype. I'm someone who likes chicken rice and eats it often at various spots on the island.  Its only marginally better than some of its neighbours inside Maxwell. There is always a line of more than 10-15 people. Its not worth the wait.  Have had consistently better in Amoy food court around the corner: isle 3, spotable by a picture of Lee Kuan Yew visiting the stall."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,13-May-14,"The line for this place (which is the longest line in the whole hawker centre) is only half-composed of obvious tourists (maybe some of the other half are non-obvious tourists, which perhaps ought to include me). It says that locals are still willing to brave the long tourist-enhanced wait for this chicken rice, despite being knowledgeable of the many alternatives. And indeed, this chicken rice is worth waiting for. There's not a whole lot of superlatives to add, except that you can definitely customize your order to include only leg meat, which I liked (I ordered 4 legs for my wife and I). Don't just order 'chicken rice' if you know anything about this dish and need to amortize your wait over more mouthfuls.  They are also happy to give you as much chilli sauce as you might need. The meat is silky and well-seasoned on its own, but the provided chilli and dark soy sauce makes it superb! I am continually astounded by reviewers who don't seem to understand that in hawker food, the side sauces are essential additions, and not just for show, like salt and pepper on western tables. Combine with a mouthful of savory rice for a spectacular sensation. PS- there are lots of seats on the outer wings of the hawker centre, don't just look for them inside."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,21-Nov-18,"What this place has going for it is that it has been featured by Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsay, so it's going to get a crowd on any given day just on that reputation. So while this place is VERY good, you should just ignore the other options at the Maxwell Hawker food center, because I ate at other places that we're just as good if not better. See my other reviews. As for Tian Tian, I did come here to try the Chicken Rice, which is the signature dish. There was a line when I showed up, and while the prices was definitely ridiculously low, customer service is not what this place is known for, but rather getting you in, getting your cash, and getting you out. Which is fine, because this is essentially a fast food joint that just happens to make really good food. As for the food itself, it's very good and tastes fresh. I was expecting an assault on my taste buds, but that never happened, until I used some of the hot / spicy sauce and poured it over my food, then it got some serious kick. Remember, the chicken is essentially poached...and the rice...it just has subtle flavoring, so you do need to kick it up a notch. My first bite of the chicken was a bit disappointing, because it was half cartilage, but the rest of the chicken on my plate was pure meat, so it made up for the nasty first bite of crunchiness. All in all, I'm glad I experienced this spot, but as I said, don't sleep on the other options at Maxwell, because they are a plenty!!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,17-Apr-17,"I tried over 10 chicken rice eateries in Singapore and this is by far my #1 favorite! The chicken is so tender and delicious that I wouldn't mind having it everything! Go early as they close their stall when everything is sold, as I got there once at 6:30pm and the staff were cleaning up since everything was sold out, even though the Maxwell Food Center where the stall is located closes at 8pm."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,8-Dec-15,"Google best chicken rice in Singapore and you are sure to find this stall in the list! Located at the heart of maxwell food centre, this stall boast large crowds and occupying two stalls spacing. I ordered a medium serving which when it came, looks plain boring. Aside from the looks, the medium serving gave quite a big portion of chicken! As there was much hype about this stall's chicken rice, I think I expected too much as when I took a bite, nothing was special about it. The chicken and rice was not bad but not ""best chicken rice"" worthy. The chilli was exceptional which gave life to my bland chicken rice! Expected much more from them!!!!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,14-May-17,Been eating at Tian Tian for years. The queue is constant but moves quite quickly. The chicken is tender and succulent and the rice can be eaten on its own. Chilli is very good but may be a little hot and spicy to some.

The chili-sauce is also really nice as it has a kick of lime in it. The chicken...well...it needed help. Even for a boiled chicken it had little flavor and was kinda slimy and rubbery and fatty at the same time. There are better places to have the whole legendary dish, but if you're near by with some touristing friends, why not."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,1-Feb-19,"First time in Singapore, but steamed chicken is something i have always loved. This is delicious! Yes, it is a simple dish but it is cooked to perfection and the tender chicken was the bomb. I enjoyed it without much of the orange sauce they serve on the side. The rice is delicious and addictive, cooked in broth with garlic and maybe a hint if ginger. We also got bean sprouts and bok choy both were good. I literally could eat this everyday! Want some right now!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",1,31-Jan-17,"Massive amount of MSG tasted and seen. Very off putting.  I guess It really depends on what type of chicken you like. But if you're a tourist, and/or have never had chicken rice before.... There are much better examples of awesome naturally cooked and flavoured chicken rice"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,8-Apr-17,"One of my favourite chicken rice stalls in Singapore. My go to place whenever I crave chicken rice for lunch. Do watch out for the long lines though. If you love chilli, make sure you ask for more!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,29-Sep-15,"chicken, rice and veg is my very favorite combo so I loved this. Wasn't thrilled that the chicken was cold or that they ran out of chinese broccoli but loved the dish regardless. Id eat here often if it wasn't across the world from me :)"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",1,30-Nov-18,The chicken rice is ok. But the 30 year old man in cap is a total trash . Ask me to bring the chilli plate back when I bought another extra chicken rice. This is real?
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,10-Jul-16,"My husband and I were in Singapore for our honeymoon and stopped by this stall as it is the famous Anthony Bourdain spot to eat at. Prior to having Tian Tian, we had Ah Tai, which is two stalls down. I can honestly say that Ah Tai is so much better. Tian Tian was just a hype and the chicken didn't even come close to tasting like Ah Tai. If you're in the area, you mind as well skip this stall and go to Ah Tai. They won't disappoint."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,10-Jul-12,"This is my favourite chicken rice ever! I know the chicken rice wars have a bit of a religious tone to it, and you might hate Tian Tian for various reasons, but... I don't care. I like it.  Seriously, the queue is really long. It's very popular with tourists and locals alike. Expect to queue -- a lot.  I like it for the fluffy rice and lovely chicken. I think I like it best because it has the better 'pak cham gai' among all the other so-called famous ones. *shrug*"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,6-Dec-13,"The reputation this place has is well deserved. Be prepared to have some of the best chicken rice possible - perfectly tender and packed full of flavor. The rice is so good it's up there with top-notch sushi.  Depending on the time of day, there can be quite a wait but it's easily worth it. I'd recommend washing the meal down with some avocado juice from a nearby vendor."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,3-Apr-13,"Please remember that this place is located in the Maxwell Food Center near Chinatown. I tried telling 10 taxi drivers Tian Tian Chicken Rice and only the last 1 of the 10 knew what I was talking about.  This vendor is the only vendor in the food center (maybe even all of Singapore) that occupies two stalls. The lines are long during the lunch rush hour so you definitely want to go before or after the rush. For 3 SGD, you get a generous portion of rice and chicken meat (white meat) with some secret brown chicken sauce poured on top of the chicken and rice. Tasty indeed. You'll want to compliment it with a freshly sugar cane drink from the stall directly across from it.  Note that this is the only vendor that has a Facebook and Twitter page. I wonder if they have a healthcare plan too."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,3-Sep-16,"Next off my list would be the Tian Tian Hainan Chicken. It is true, the Hainan chicken taste so much better in Singapore than in state. The line was extremely long, I thought I will stay here for at least an hour. Surprisingly, I only waited 20 mins, and the food is ready for me!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,24-Oct-13,"Ate here several times over the course of a few days. Had the chicken rice, and fortified it with an extra drumstick, which was deboned! Of all the food stalls at the Maxwell Centre, this is the only one that has a line. It is also the only one that will run out of food. Geez, I still dream of this chicken."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,31-Oct-13,"There's a reason why the queue wraps around the entire food court. The Hainanese Chicken here is phenomenal and the rice that's been cooked in the stock & chicken oil is just as good. Simple, yet so flavorful. This was probably one of the best things I've eaten in Singapore."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,2-Oct-16,"Good quality chicken rice. So goo that the queue is barely tolerable, usually 20+ hungry diners stretching out into the carpark.  I took some guests there figuring we could get some good chicken rice, We had just dropped into the Hong Kong Chicken Rice place on Smith Street with the Michelin star and the queue was over 100 people. So I thought with all the constuction at Maxwell we stood a fair chance. But Tian Tian had over 30+ people that day. The other Hainanese chicken rice place had 5 people so we compromised. It's been a few years but if the queue thins out I will re-rate this place. You can't blame a hawker stand for having too much business."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,24-Jan-14,"The hype did not live up to the expectation.  In terms of ice bath chickens, I've definitely had better such as at Nong's Khao Man Gai in Portland, OR.  I got half a chicken for $12 and the dark meat was fine and dandy. The white meat was a bit on the drier and tasteless side.  The chicken rice and hot sauce were delicious though but not enough to carry this dish to a 4 stars and up."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,18-Jun-14,"Pros: chicken rice is delicious  Cons: Hot, no a/c, waiting in line"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,30-Sep-16,need to wait on line but it's worthy to do that! Super cheap! The skin of chicken is just like jelly! I went there three times in half month!
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,3-Aug-16,"Tian Tian is fine. But if you are like me and read about it being the very best thing to eat in Singapore and then saw all the Anthony Bourdain signage they have all over the place, you are likely to be disappointed. It's good but did not change my life, which after all the hoopla I thought was a done deal. Fortunately the line, even when it circles around the stall, is fast."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,27-Oct-15,"Ever since their chief quit, the chicken rice is never the same.  Chicken is not as tender as before. Rice is most time a bit too hard. Also they have lose their signature fragrance which they use to have for their rice. So far, only their sauce which they pour over chicken and chili sauce detent the same standard.  TianTian is now more like a tourist spot than a famous chicken rice stall which I use to know.  The long queue is still there but no longer the locals but replace by all the tourist.  It's just living on their past reputation.  *Something to note. Their ex-chef open a stall just a few stall away. I believe many have mention that. Other than the chili sauce. They win hands down."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,11-Aug-18,Overrated. We came here cause a lot of social media is recommending this place but the reality is much different. Long lines and the chicken came out a bit cold. The taste wasn't any different than most chicken rice places.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,15-May-15,"After all the hype I most definitely had to give it a go. After passing by Maxwell on a Sunday and realizing the queue was only about 8 people (usually there's up to a 45 minute wait) I decided I would give it a try. The chicken rice is alright, a bit greasy for my taste, and they tend to add some gravy-like dressing on it when served which I have to say definitely gives it a nice flavor boost. I have to say, though, that anything upwards of $5 is a bit steep for chicken rice which, yes, may have beat Gordon Ramsey, but what does he know about chicken rice? While I'm glad I gave it a try, I'll stick to my usual fares for a shorter wait and a lesser of a dent in the wallet."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,29-Jul-15,"The line's always pretty long, but this is probably the best chicken rice for the price. If you're not up for waiting, I personally think the other chicken rice stalls in the area serve comparable fare."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,20-Mar-15,"Saw this on Anthony Bourdain so we had to add it to the list. The queue wrapped around the back of the building. I don't know what they do to this chicken and I don't care. I just want it to get into my mouth now. I have never had such delicious, tender, juicy chicken in my life. If I lived in Singapore I would eat this every day."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,3-Oct-16,"The chicken rice here is good but it's not that fantastic that is worth the wait. if you are in a hurry, there are other stalls that is same price but almost the same taste if you are not picky."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,21-Aug-16,"It's good, but not worth the hype, especially when the line wraps around the corner. It's a bucket list experience, but I actually prefer the chicken rice just down the street at Lau Pa Sat."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,11-Apr-16,"Yes you will wait about 20min or so to order, but don't let that deter you. This chicken rice really is that good. I tried the closest competitor a few booths down, which apparently was an ex-exmployee of Tian Tian, side by side and there really is a difference. Tian Tian dish is more subtle in taste compared to the other which tastes mostly like garlic. Anytime I am in Singapore this is my first stop and should be yours too, Chicken Rice is simply the most simplest complex looking dish anywhere and is not to be missed."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,8-Sep-15,Make sure you go to the right one. All the chicken stalls in this hawker centre have a blue sign with yellow lettering for some reason...
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,13-Oct-15,"Favourite chicken rice. Downside - after you eat this, you won't want to eat at other stalls."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,8-May-18,"Amazing! After hearing about it from a friend bc of Anthony Bourdain, I had to try it. It is a no frills hawker stand in a food court of hawker stalls - so don't go for the ambiance or environment, but if you want one of the best chicken plates you will ever have - this is your spot! I ate two and contemplated a third! Most, delicious chicken with aromatic rice. So good! Combine it with a juice from the stall across the hall and it will be one of your best meals in Singapore"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,23-Mar-16,Not as good as it used to be:( I feel like the rice is not as flavorful anymore but the chicken is still really tender. I was never a fan of the sauce though and always ask for it without it.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,30-Jul-16,Tried so many chicken rice in Singapore. But definitely had the best chicken rice at this stall! Highly recommended for those visiting Singapore.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,9-Apr-15,"This place is featured on nearly every travel programme, so I felt I had to check it out. I was not disappointed. The chicken was the best I've ever had anywhere in the world. Pillow soft, tender and perfectly cooked. Even the fat was tasty. The rice was aromatic and the perfect accompaniment. I would have preferred if the brown sauce was left off, as all this dish needs is the thick soy sauce and ginger/chili paste to flavor it. And at SIN $7 it's a steal."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",1,26-Jun-18,"WORST chicken rice you can have in South East Asia (and probably the whole planet!!!) Cold & tasteless chicken, very less meat, smell like bloody lizard..the rice is so hard to chew, oily and that's it. Chicken got no skin also. OVERRATED LAHHHHHH!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,1-Mar-16,"I traveled thousands of miles (again) to eat something that looked 'kinda interesting' on an Anthony Bourdain Program. I'm not saying it's not good, just sayin I gotta stop being such a fanboy! Every time I feel like a super-gritty explorer only to find a shrine to ol'Tony and a mutated hipster-behemoth of a food stall. I don't blame the owners either, gut those 'foodies' with their selfie-sticks - or make that us, minus the selphie stick... aah, don't listen to me, I guess I'm just jaded^^ 3 Stars says it's A ok - following the laws of the free market, that should go for every Chicken Rice Place in the area tho..."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,1-Feb-16,"The quality of the chicken has dropped dramatically compared to the time when the lady boss was still there. The rice is still good but chicken meat is dry. Service is bad as well. They now only give the free soup, which is a standard for all chicken rices in Singapore, if you ask."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,6-Aug-13,"We ate here twice during our 24hr stopover in Singapore. I still daydream about the succulent, juicy chicken that's laid atop a bed of perfectly seasoned rice. A simple yet utterly delectable dish that I'm sure hasn't been successfully recreated in the states, otherwise I would've found it."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,21-Jul-14,"Waited 45 minutes in the sweltering Singapore heat. Not sure if my expectations were too high or the long wait just put a damper on things - but the chicken rice just wasn't as fantastic as I had hoped. In fact, I would have been more satisfied if I'd just gone to my usual chicken rice place in Marina Square (a 'must do' each time I visit Singapore). The chicken was moist but I don't think the flavour was as good as some other places. And was not a fan of their chilli sauce. The rice was probably the winner. This place was on my bucket list - so am glad I get to tick the box. Not likely to return though. Not for the chicken rice anyway. Wouldn't mind trying some of the other stalls at the Maxwell Food Centre."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,27-Jul-14,The chicken was sooooooooo tender. Rice was okay. Dipping sauce was a killer. Might be a bit difficult to find a good spot to sit down during lunch time.

Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,15-Nov-12,"The best chicken rice in town. I know because I've lived here for many years, and chicken rice happens to be my favorite local dish. I've exhausted the many options available, but at the end of the day, it still boils down to this stall. After all, Anthony Bourdain can't be wrong, can he? I think to achieve the perfect chicken rice dish, both the chicken and rice must be excellent, and I've had many plates from many places that serves either perfect chicken or perfect rice. This stall serves the most fragrant rice which is moist and flavorful, and coupled with the chilli sauce, is exceptional. The chicken is very tasty, and very tender. Definitely a number 1 stop for tourists and locals (if you haven't tried it)."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,20-Jan-16,"Some might say the line is not worth the wait. I've had chicken rice in many places and I would definitely go to this place again. Good flavor, sauce was good. It's chicken rice so can't really say it's something I'd crave, but some place I'd take friends visiting Singapore."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,8-Sep-12,"I've reviewed a few chicken rice so far, but let me reiterate the 3 main factors that I rate chicken rice on (in order of priority): the rice, the chicken and finally the chilli. There has been a big hoo-haa about Tian Tian, and since I don't stay near the area or work near the area, this is actually my 2nd visit. I visited Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice at 3.30 pm on a weekday and was surprised that there was a queue. Looks like this stall is certainty famous. First of all, let's talk about the rice. The rice was fragrant and flavourful. However, not all the grains of the rice were soft. Some stuck together and were hard. The chicken drizzled in a 'special' sauce mixed by Tian Tian was amazingly tender, fleshy and tasty. I also tried the chilli sauce, and it was delicious! Together with the chicken, it definitely brings the taste up to a whole new level. Overall, Tian Tian definitely serves up one of the best chicken rice in Singapore, but if you're not a fan of queuing, better think twice about coming here especially during the peak mealtimes."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,13-Feb-13,"I never saw the TV episode featuring this hawker stall, but based on various recommendations I came here for lunch on Saturday. Looking for one of the stalls with the long lines There are two lines, one to order and pay, and the other one to pick up.  Despite having chicken rice at Boon Tong Kee the night before, we ordered one plate of chicken rice to share. Chicken was good and tender, but I preferred the version at Boon Tong Kee. I definitely thought the rice was more aromatic here!  Plenty of open seating in the small aisle behind the stall."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,7-Jan-15,Best chicken rice I've ever eat in the anywhere in the world.Although the chicken looks nothing special but it taste great. Also rice do have a great taste too!
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,6-Jan-15,Don't miss this place! It's as good as Bordain says. We were traveling with someone who goes to Singapore frequently (when we went through immigration the officer said "welcome back Adam"). He insisted we not miss Tian Tian at the Hawker Center. The chicken and rice were s delicious I can't even describe it. The bok choi was cooked perfectly. Prices really cheap. Five people about US$20. Wherever you are in Singapore Uber or Taxi to this place for a meal.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",1,15-May-14,"Maybe I'm just not a Chicken Rice kind of gal. I came to Maxwell Center to try the chicken rice at Tian Tian where Anthony Bourdain raved about the chicken. I ate one ligament-filled, slimy piece and left the rest. The rice was fine, but I'm not a fan of the slug-texture chicken that seems raw and feels rubbery. It is very cheap (SG$ 3.50). If you love this stuff, don't worry: the line moves very quickly. The servers are curt and uncommunicative - you aren't allowed one of those plastic cafeteria trays unless you're ordering multiple meals. Unfortunately, if this is as good as it gets, I'm swearing off this Singaporean national food."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,21-Aug-17,"As the standard bearer of Singapore's signature national dish, Tian Tian delivers juicy, delicious chicken with some of the most fragrant rice to be found anywhere. The eternally long queues are testament to the flavourful food, but prepare yourselves for a long wait."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,20-Sep-12,"Chicken rice is the unofficial national dish of Singapore. The best chicken rice I had in Singapore was here, matter of fact, it's the best I've ever had anywhere. This hawker stall is also highly regarded as one of best chicken rice stands in the entire city-state. The chicken is very moist and tender and the rice is definitely something special; looks like a bed of plain white rice, which many other chicken rice stalls serve, but it really is more than meets the eye as it is much more flavorful than you'd expect it to be. The rice is cooked and prepared differently, using chicken stock, and the difference is definitely in the taste and it compliments the chicken perfectly. Came here twice but really wanted to come back even more times during my time in Singapore, but there was so much other food to try and only a limited amount of room in my stomach. Any future trips I have to Singapore will undoubtedly include a stop here."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,2-Apr-14,"Upon our travels to Singapore, Chicken rice was on my food fanatic husbands agenda. Yes, we stood in the Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice line. It is what I had expected as far as flavor. Good chicken with flavorful rice. My only suggestion is to order the whole chicken. Half a chicken is not enough! It seemed like it was 1/4 of a chicken. Especially if you are a tourist, order the whole chicken! Don't wait in line for a few pieces of chicken. Get the whole thing!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,30-Aug-15,"Dear Anthony Bourdain, I'm glad you no longer have a restaurant so I won't suffer the disappointment of high expectations. Generally, I hate queuing for food, but after reading many fantastic reviews and recommendations, I left the bf in queue with a cold beer to pacify him while I went in search of supplemental food. The tables were packed. Fortunately I managed to chope a table by Maxwell Road, a bit of road construction noise, but the cool breeze makes eating beatable unlike the hothouse conditions of the rest of the food centre. Ok, so back to the chicken... disappointing. The chicken was tough, potentially overcooked or from frozen and chopped way too thick. I'm used to silky smooth meat that's full of flavour. And where was my chicken skin? I know it's not healthy, but surely that should be my decision to make??? This was then covered with a gravy. Surely that's only required if you need to remoisten the meat or add flavour to the bland chicken. Anyway, onto the rice. It had some chicken stock flavour, but was way too sticky and heavy in my opinion. Could have been enhanced with more ginger/garlic. Condiments... The chilli was passable but nothing worth writing about. Apparently you have to specifically ask if you want ginger and sweet soy. I say a lot, but the reputation certainly builds up the expectation. Im willing to try again just to be sure, but for now, my search for the best chicken rice in Singapore continues..."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,2-Nov-12,"I had a long stopover at Changi, so hopped on the MRT and found myself near Maxwell Road. I knew this place was somewhere around there, so after walking around for about 20 minutes, I found it in the hawker centre. There wasn't a queue when I was there (I was eating at about 4pm, an odd time thanks to my jet-lag inducing travel), so service was quick. This is simply the BEST chicken rice I have ever tasted -- juicy, tender, and a good amount. The chili sauce made it oh so better."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,10-May-16,"Literally the best hainanese chicken Ive ever had. The chicken is so tender and juicy. Dont forget the orangey sauce, its delicious with the chicken and rice. The line is long but come early once they sell out thats it, they close shop. Dont be fooled there is another hainanese chicken shop nearby theirs that starts preparing and getting long lines by unsuspecting tourists when this place closes."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",1,12-Oct-14,"I'm visiting and went here based on a recommendation (that I will not follow again). This place had the longest que signifying that this was the favorite. After receiving the chicken and rice, I had a hard time swallowing a poached slime like chicken with skin that was like flesh. I think that the desire was for quantity and not quality here. Very little flavor, poor texture and a waste of time and calories is my take."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,3-Aug-14,Chicken is still as succulent and rice still as flavorful as I remember it years ago. The line was short on a Sunday morning.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,23-Jan-14,The chicken rice holds up to the hype. Bourdain didn't steer us wrong on this one. All the components hold up. It's a cheap reliable meal. Be prepared for a line though.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,12-Dec-12,"The must-eat spot at Maxwell food court. It's crowded for sure, but very worth it. Chicken rice is juicy, flavorful and comes in a large portion for such a low price.  Anthony Bourdain approved, and I can definitely see why!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,15-Mar-13,The rice had the best slight favor to enhance the tender chicken. The person making our plate took alot of time to make sure it was perfect and I love the little spray bottle of favor that kept it moist and added something to it. Wish I was close enough to get it again.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,18-Jun-13,The rice is freakin incredible!!! Wow I was surprised just how good the dish was. I added the garlic hot sauce and that really took it up a level. Just goes to show you how good a simple dish of chicken and rice can be. Excellent food and glad I visited the Maxwell Food Centre it was a great experience.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,20-Jan-13,Wonderful! Everything was just fantastic! The chicken was super tender and the rice was great!
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,3-Feb-14,"I asked the locals why the queue for this place was long, they said because of advertising and reviews. But the original chef, who has been working there for years opened up his own stall about 4 doors down (similar blue sign) and its still awesome and juicy meat on big chickens but without the wait. So decide for yourself.  I'm an expat in singapore and chicken rice tastes pretty much the same to me wherever I go, (its just steamed chicken and boiled rice in a broth sauce afterall lets not over glamourise it) so surely only real connoisseurs can probably tell the difference? Am sure people say the same about our fish and chips - but we all have our favourite place.  The thai place opposite this place did this fried rice really was amazing and yummy so I will go there again next time."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,4-Oct-14,"Chicken is tasteless, rice is dry, veggie is bland. Not worth to try. You should go down to the end of Maxwell center, there is the old man, who used to cook for this kiosk. He may cook better and his chicken is cheaper."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,16-Nov-13,"Best chicken rice I've had. The portion is bigger and it is juicier than usual. The rice is also not as oily as usual. It's still cheap though, which is probably why the line is so long."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,4-Dec-15,"Very low key, tiny business, but serves delicious chicken & rice rice plate. Chicken & Rice is what they are famous for and highly recommended. If you're there, go and experience it. The food won't disappoint you and reserve some time because this place will make you want to walk around and look."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,29-Jun-13,"So far, the best tasting chicken fried rice in Singapore. The rice is so fragrant and you can really taste the ginger and all other spices in it, although nothing special in the steamed or roasted chicken. Definitely 1 of the modern version of hawker with a separate line to take order and another 1 to get the food with numbered ticket that you'd get and hand down to get the order, which makes the long line during lunch move pretty fast."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,13-Oct-16,"Not sure what they did to the chicken (or to the rice?) to get those flavors and aromas, but this is absolutely delicious. Ask for the thick soy sauce on the side. My friends mentioned after the fact that they also serve free soup with your meal. It never hurts to ask. Best $4.50 (SIN) I've ever spent."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,7-Jan-14,"Great chicken rice, $3.50, a must have while in Singapore. Line moves quickly, so don't be deterred. Lots of locals eat here, so you know it's good! Directly across is a fruit juice stall that sells delicious lychee juice for $1.50."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,9-Sep-16,"This place is solid but the line is forever, so go off peak. In the end, rice can only be so good and chicken can only be so good, it is about the condiments you mix in. I think the food is fine, but in my opinion on a par with similar venues in similar food courts. I advise against picking this over others. I know everyone has their favorite ones, and I get that. However, to this guy I love them all and the distinctions made between them such that one should wait in a long line doesn't make sense to me. Just one man's view."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,18-Sep-12,"For one thing, the main photo of this YELP page needs to be changed as it shows the wrong location for this particular stall.  Anyhow, time for the review.  This is obviously one of the best places in Singapore to get chicken rice, although I wouldn't call it the best because I have had better but also I'm sure that there is a hidden gem that I still haven't found.  The chicken - Juicy, and good portion. The quality of the meat is top notch, except one time they gave me a piece that was all bone, but that was also my fault for not requesting breast meat.  The chili - One of the best I've had, but I have had better.  The rice - Good rice, but I've also had better. There is a chicken rice stall in the Redhill Food Centre which I think has better rice and better chili although the quality of the chicken meat isn't as nice.  I also think that Ah Tai (the competitor to Tian Tian and also run by the ex-chef from Tian Tian) is overall a better stall.  Try Ah Tai before you make your decision on which is the best."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,11-May-14,"Long queue for chicken rice, though chicken is tender, rice is indeed tasty. Price is good too."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,31-May-14,The Chicken Rice is Singapore's national dish - but Tian Tian is Singapore's legend.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,4-Aug-16,This Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice is very delicious & authentic. It tastes like my mother's Hainanese Chicken Rice. Please prepare to queue up for 30 minutes (minimum) but it is really worth your calories :):):)
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,15-May-16,Super great place to consume the local speciality. Tasty dishes and efficient service. really enjoyed the food.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,1-Feb-13,"For a full review, visit:  http://urbanjourney.com/food-and-drink/tian-tian-chicken-rice-maxwell-food-centre-400  Although simple, Tian Tian Chicken Rice delivers a texture and taste that develops wonderfully in your mouth and the smell fills your nose like no other. The rice is cooked in such a manner that every single grain tastes of their delicious chicken broth.  There's usually no question of whether you are eating the drumstick or the breast meat on a chicken, but at this stall, your taste buds and so called expertise on countless chicken eating experiences will come into question because you truly can't tell. Try only the Kampong Chicken, which has made this stall a living legend under the watchful eyes of Madam Foo Kui Lian."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,31-Jul-16,"Rice, poached chicken, plastic plate, stuffy foodcourt. Is this Singapore? Yes, of course. Is it worth being in an international food guide? Well, considering the amazing number of stalls and even eating house having devoted their life to this finally quite simple dish, one could wonder why them? I know of dozens which are as good if not better. Yes, I know, the rice and so on....But plenty of place do a good, soft, moist, tasty rice as it should be. So ok, its good but thats it."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,22-Jul-16,Overrated store. There is much better chicken rice store out there and also it is not cheap.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,13-Jul-16,awesome as always with the succulent chicken meat and fragrant oily rice!
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,7-Jan-13,"i must preface by saying that i never order chicken out. i'm not a big fan of chicken, b/c i usually think it's bland, but i do make an exception in the case of hainan chicken rice. i think this place had the best hainan chicken rice of all the places i tried in singapore. the rice was really flavorful here, and the chicken was poached just right. they gave more white meat too, which i like better."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,22-May-13,"Actually, even though the queues are long, they move fairly fast from my experience. The chicken rice is a clear winner, and the star of the dish. Chicken is tender and good too, but the rice is heavenly! Especially with the chilli which really does pack a punch. My advice? Come at the right time so you don't have to wait too long and prepare your order for your turn so you don't incur the wrath of the owner or other customers waiting in line!"
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,8-Jun-13,"of course, i went on recommendation from anthony bourdain. easy to spot with the anthony bourdain signs. i got to the store 30 min before they opened, but there was already a line of people waiting. i ordered the hainanese chicken as expected, and sat myself at one of the tables. i have to say i wasn't overly impressed with the chicken. don't get me wrong, it was good, but it wasn't earth shattering as expected. i've had better at other hawker centers. again, everything was well prepared though, and the food was good, but it just wasn't amazing. maybe i came with too high expectations?  the price was obviously very affordable (less than $5). i would definitely have this any day over the regular fast food you find in the US. but if you're looking for good hainanese chicken, there are plenty of other hawker centers that provide better."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,8-Jan-13,"3.5 this may be the most famous hainan chicken rice because Bourdain was here, but after eating it, I wasn't overwhelmingly impressed. moist white meat with a good ginger chili sauce is important along with a chicken flavored rice, but it just wasn't something I was craving afterwards. lots to try in all these food centers, and yes the crowded ones are typically good."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,17-May-17,"been to joo chiat Tian Tian , air condition chicken is good and soft. highly recommended."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,24-Nov-14,"Still the best chicken rice in Singapore, in my honest opinion. Besides, they have a wide variety of dishes....apart from chicken."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",5,8-Jun-14,Worth the wait! Definitely the longest line at the Maxwell Hawker Center and there's a good reason for it. The chicken is tender and the rice is very flavorful. There are other stalls in the hawker center that sell chicken and rice but this one is the only one with a line.
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",3,27-Jul-16,"i think it can be better, because the vibe is hip, the color purple, the guys on-trend."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",2,29-Nov-13,"Tian Tian is decent as far as chicken rice go, but not above average and not worth the hype. Everyone would have his or her preferences on how they like their chicken rice. Of the famous chicken rice stalls / chains, for those who like more strongly-flavoured chicken rice, there's Boon Tong Kee that's better, and for those who like delicately-flavoured stuff, Chin Chin at Purvis Street."
Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.9,433,"Hainan, Chicken Shop",4,13-Feb-14,"It's a good meal to try something very local and acclaimed. If you want chicken rice, I don't think there is a better place in Singapore. The meat is served very well cooked and the rice is spiced just right!"
Lai Wah Restaurant,4.3,3,Chinese,5,7-Nov-16,"Great place for Chinese food. Some items I tried and liked were the Venison fried hor fun, yang chow fried rice, and pork chop. I truly enjoyed the variety they have on the menu and I was happy to have tried deer meat for the first time! It tasted like beef! The customer service was great here too."
Lai Wah Restaurant,4.3,3,Chinese,4,31-Dec-14,"Decor is dated but the food is good. So if you can go pass the frills, this is the place to have a good meal.  We ordered quite a few of their signature dishes and were suitably impressed. We liked their: * yam ring * salted egg calamari * Claypot eggplant with salted fish * stir fry vege with garlic * roasted chicken * soup of the day  Their dessert items are some hits, some misses. The Mango Pudding was well received while I found the Almond Longan Jelly to be a little weird tasting. The salted egg buns were only so-so.  The bill is not cheap but for the flavour and dining comfort, it's a return trip for the family soon."
Lai Wah Restaurant,4.3,3,Chinese,4,26-Aug-15,"Legend. This is the place where the late Master Supreme Heavenly Chef Tham Yew Kai used to helm. ( For real - he was known as one of the four heavenly chefs in the 1960s)- master as he innovated, recreated and experimented with Cantonese cuisine.  Food wise you can read about the history of this place. It was a lab of innovation with the birth of the Yam Ring ( an homage to a monks alm bowl) , the origin of Lo Hei and so on. Laiwah is a good place to honour a chef that has come before us - food wise they churn out food incredibly quick so feel free to indulge.  Venison Horfun was delish(MUst order!), some of the dishes are now rare fare in most Cantonese places so are definitely worth a try. I found the mandarin stewed chicken a little heavy for me but I think thats cos I am trying it in 2015.. Pork chops in delish sauce are pretty yummy though so I guess fried pork does transcend time. The chicken with broccoli and ham was also rather unusual as I have not had that before. Pretty good with white rice though."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,12-Jun-24,Every time I'm in Singapore I have to visit this place! Some of the best Indian food around by far. You have to try those tandoori mushrooms. The taste is authentic with just the right amount of heat to tantalize the tastebuds. The service was quick and efficient. They brought out the food a few minutes after we ordered. The restaurant is huge with both indoor and outdoor seating. If you have a hankering for good Indian give it a try.
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,11-Jan-24,"The food was simply amazing! For the table we ordered butter chicken, tandoori chicken, saffron rice, as well as garlic naan. The service was great and the food came out quickly. The setting was on a main road but there wasn't too much noise and the seating was sufficient for our small group."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,14-May-23,"Thanks fellow Yelpers! You were right about the delicious Indian food at Khansama Tandoori! This place was easy to find since it is right on a corner, and I was escorted upstairs with the suggestion I would probably enjoy air conditioned dining. They were right because today, with the heat index, it felt like 116F according to my weather app (high humidity and high starting temp). The service was friendly, helpful and pretty efficient considering how busy it became soon after I entered. I had to choose my favorite, samosa chaat, and it was delicious! The portion was large, had edgy spice, and came with cooling raita for balance. Samosa chaat is a large veggie samosa smothered in chick pea curry - yum! Fortunately, this item is very reasonable at $6 US, but as others have noted, the prices can be considered on the higher side for little India. This place also has a full bar and offers a variety of wine choices. The menu doesn't show that wines can be purchased by the glass, but they can. This lunch was an excellent, tasty and cooling break before heading out to the brutal heat of the botanic gardens (worth it for the calm and beauty). I recommend this restaurant for its delicious food and the nice experience provided. One tip: when you are ready to pay and leave, approach the register (by the service area) and ask to pay. It helps if you tell your table number, which is noted on each table. They also accept credit cards."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,23-Dec-23,"Amazing food. Had a large party (9 people) seated upstairs in air conditioning. Appetizers were tasty and fast. Entrees were delicious and fast. Service was excellent--personable, courteous and need I say it again fast"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,24-Mar-23,"Tasty but pricey Indian fare in the heat of little India. We stopped in for a quick bite and found the samosas, chana masala and naan to be delicious. I'd definitely be tempted to come back but the prices are simply outrageous. It's priced way out of the local market and definitely geared towards tourist money."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,25-Jul-22,Friendly service and excellent food! Everything we ordered was delicious and portions were very generous. The highlight of the meal was the tikka sampler.
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,20-Jun-22,"Amazing. I was looking for an authentic spot to try some Indian food and this is it! Easy place to find as it is in the corner. Staff were friendly. There's an option to sit outside and inside-upstairs with air conditioning. It's hard to not try everything. The amount of food they served us was big. What we got was perfect for two. We had cheese naan, chicken tikka masala, pepper chicken, aloo tikki, and samosas. Highly recommend this spot!"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,28-Apr-17,"I'm a big fan of eating with my hands. Not that you have to they're have forks but when you order roti and stuff it with everything in your reach you really don't have a chance!  This food is delectable! We passed by the first time in hope we would find something better maybe and no cigar. We walked right back. The place isn't much to look at they're under construction. The chairs are lawn chairs but who cares I'm here to chow.  We had mutton kebab, chicken tandoori, mutton curry, vegetable rice and roti with a side of white sauce. JUST WOW. Spicy, delicious, savory. My mouth is watering I miss it so much.  The staff is a little stand off ish but once you get their attention they're incredibly nice. Food is fast we ordered and ate in a half hour bc we had a tour to catch. I honestly will miss this place the most!"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,9-Feb-19,"Came here for a late lunch on one of those crazy hot days and so thankful that they have a/c setup upstairs.  It's hard for me to commit to just one dish when it comes to Indian food, so I caved to my cravings and ordered a variety: Rogan Josh, baingan bharta, chicken tikka, biryani, and garlic naan. (Yes, I did eat it all by myself.)  Sauce on the Rogan Josh was great, though would've preferred the mutton to be more tender. Paired with the fragrant biryani, that sauce made a killer combo for carb coma afterwards. Garlic naan was incredible as well. Always get it with butter/ghee.  The eggplant was solid, but the sauce from the Rogan Josh stole the show. Chicken tikka was incredibly tender, but thought the season was leaning on the salty side.  Left completely satisfied. Will be back soon!"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,4-Dec-19,"""Probably the best Indian food in Singapore"" is their motto and I'd have to agree. The outdoor/patio seating was packed at 1am so we were escorted to their upstairs lounge. Looking medieval and historic with brick, I was glad we were able to enjoy a late night dinner in this room. The food was perfect. Enjoyed their Chicken Kebab Masala and Garlic Buttered Naan. Very authentic flavors and wasn't afraid to use my hands to eat! It would have been a perfect experience except for the below average service. We were never greeted and had to flag down servers several times to get them to take a drink order. I wanted to order another dish but never had the change or opportunity to. I would suggest take out or maybe calling ahead to place an order? I would definitely come back here when visiting Little India and if you have an appetite past midnight, they will surely accommodate."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,24-Oct-19,"Solid 4.5 stars. Came here for dinner during the week. Was pretty crowded even on a Tuesday, but we managed to get seated pretty quick. It reminds you of restaurants in the 90s in India (in a good way). We got the hara bhara kebab and aloo tikki chaat to start off with. Was very tasty especially the kebab. Had garlic naan and paneer butter masala for mains, again very tasty and very fresh. I was super impressed, and will be back to try their non-veg options soon!"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,3,15-Nov-20,"Easily to find, right at the corner of a busy street. Over officious service, in a good way. We being vegetarians tried paneer tikka, chole and biryani. Paneer was ok, lived up to expectations, but chole and biryani fell far short of a restaurant level biryani. There are umpteen places with better tasting biryani and chole in singapore. Overall, experience was ok, but food could have been better tasting vs the rating."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,27-Dec-21,"The chicken briyani here is a must try! I personally prefer briyanis that have a lot of gravy, but the briyani here is really tasty even without much gravy! 10/10"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,4-Nov-19,"I hiked about 2 miles from my hotel, through Little India, just to get here and it was so worth the walk! There's outdoor seating for milder weather and indoor seating with A/C, which is a lifesaver if you're here at the height of summer.  The staff are very friendly, and service is pretty fast. Though I will say that I purposely avoided the busiest hours because I wanted more time to sightsee and shop.  The food is amazing. I know vindaloo is pretty much the most basic/boring thing to get at an Indian restaurant, but the mutton vindaloo was probably the best I've had anywhere this far. I like things very spicy, and they matched what I asked for! (Which, as some of you spice lovers know, doesn't always happen everywhere). Their naan was delicious. And the spiced tea (I got it iced) was amazing! Definitely recommended if you're in the area!"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,7-May-17,Delicious food! The friendly waiter was patient with me while I stared at their enormous menu and decided on what to get. I ordered the mutton kebab masala and chicken biryani. Both were incredibly flavorful and the meat in both were tender. Way better than most of the Indian restaurants I've had in the U.S. My only regret is that I came along and I couldn't order as many dishes and I wanted.
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,4-Jul-17,"You think it's a tourist trap, or maybe it is, but when the food is good I don't care.  This place is one of the many Indian restaurants in Little India. It's not easy to stumble into the restaurants if you're not looking for it, albeit the corner location. However, the food was lip-smacking good. We ordered the grilled fish, the mushroom tandoori and the pakora starter and washed everything down with good old Tiger. Shortly said, I was happy with the food!"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,31-Jul-19,"The food was very delicious. The best Indian food I've tried while being in Singapore. The fish tikka masala had just enough spice, the vegetable biryani was flavorful and the honey lemon tea satisfied my quench. I will definitely go back."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,19-May-17,"The restaurant claims that it's possibly the best Indian restaurant in Singapore. And this is very possibly true. I ordered the Curry Mutton, a low- to medium-spicy lamb dish full of flavor. The meat was tender and the combination of spices very authentic.  I would avoid the fancier naans and opt for the plain naan instead. The garlic naan was a bit drier than I had hoped for."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,2,3-Jun-17,"Location: This place is located in Little India, Singapore. When I came here around early/mid April, they were doing construction downstairs, so it wasn't a place I would considered just by looking outside. I came here through Yelp and since I was around the area, thought I'll give it a try.  Environment/Service: I had to go upstairs, since downstairs was constructing (so I was told). If you know Singapore, it gets pretty damn hot. It was pretty hot upstairs and it was poorly ventilated. It's a horrible experience when you're sweating so much, yet trying to consume food. It was pretty busy due to the area being a tourist friendly area, but service was slow and waiters were not attentive. Their chairs are so heavy and huge, which makes it so difficult to even get up to use the bathroom.  Food: I tried their chicken curry and their jumbo prawns. The chicken curry was okay, meat was too dry and wasn't really my type of curry (I had Indian food before and it was better). Their jumbo prawns did not look like prawns and rather more like regular shrimps. It was also on the pricier side for mediocre food. Their menu is like a book. A lot of choices, but definitely overwhelming. If I remembered correctly, it was about 30 pages or more!  Overall, I give this place two stars. Two stars only because maybe other dishes on the menu could've tasted better, but I wouldn't know. Other than that, service was not great, it was too hot to even move, and our food wasn't that great either."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,1-Jan-19,"Was here for a wonderfully delicious early afternoon lunch, upstairs in air conditioned comfortable dining room. Fantastic menu. Excellent service and great value. Highly recommend!"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,3,17-Mar-16,The service could be better. It would have been good if the servers are more informative especially to customers who are unfamiliar with the food. It would also nice to have a service with a smile - that will help to improve the dining experience. Such a pity as the food is quite good.
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,19-Jan-19,"I'm in SIN a lot and a freind took me to this place in Little India. Sat on the street corner in red plastic chairs and awaited with a pint of Tiger in hand.  The smells emanating form the area are intense, and the waft coming from Khansama is hard to describe. Think Pepe Le Pew floating in the air, hooked on a dreaming scent.  The grilled tandoori chicken samples was just amazing. The same 3 cuts of chicken cooked with 3 different spices...one red, one green, one yellow. Green ( whatever the hell it was ) was nuts.  The mixed biryani following was also solid. Mouthwatering.  If you want a casual space, easy attitude and scrumptious Indian food, take it for a spin."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,15-Apr-19,"Fantastic food, you talk about flavor, this food was cooked just right. We had the chicken masala and the mutton masala. We would definitely have it again. ALSO, so HOT in Singapore, ask to go upstairs in the Air Con part of the restaurant."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,30-Apr-17,"Been here twice, this would be a great place for you to explore Indian foods!  Kind of like the ancient set up, especially the furniture used, very nostalgic (try to move their chairs too, I've ever joked with the waiter, I would need to eat more in order to pull/ shift the chairs...lol).  Foods wise, I have ordered twice the:  Butter Chicken, well marinated chicken piece, tandoor grilled with pleasant aroma, served in rich buttery gravy, one of the best Butter Chicken that I've eaten.  Cheese Naan, gooey cheese hidden in warm and soft naan bread, with strong tandoori fragrant. Heavenly yummy when dipped with Butter Chicken gravy, opps, it should come in set!  Try the Biryani, Vegetable Pakora (served with good mint dip) and Mushroom Masala. With wide selections of the menu, they will guide you through the authentic Indian taste!"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,3,22-Apr-16,"Update: Returned this week and they're still using the table and chairs that makes Khansama Singapore's ""most uncomfortable restaurant"". The sad thing is that the furniture obviously cost them a small fortune. It's very detailed and over designed. Sadly, the chairs are so large and the detail on the tables so low that it's impossible to maneuver the chairs under the table. Two chairs barely sit side by side under the table. Plastic outdoor furniture would be an improvement.  Tip: The waiters are there to upsell you on more than you need. Be cautious because they've mastered the art of persuasion, and don't seem pushy at all. They will suggest more than you need. Unsuspecting Ang Mohs beware - Best to order less then order more as you gauge your hunger.  Reducing my rating by one star for the torture chamber devices that they call tables and chairs."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,27-May-13,"This is my ""go-to"" Indian Restaurant in Little India. They never disappoint. The staff is friendly, efficient, well trained, attentive and speedy and I have never had a dish I didn't like. I won't mention specific dishes because it's all good. I've dined here 9-10 times and each time is as good as the last. The sauces are sinfully rich so order light if you're not going straight to bed after wards. You can dine upstairs in the air con or down on the sidewalk along Norris Rd. The decor upstairs is nothing fancy (it's ornate but could use a a face lift). Downstairs, they have widened the sidewalk to make it a little more roomy. I suggest taking a group so you can order lots and sample a variety of their dishes. Great Indian food in the heart of Little India.  UPDATE: Visited last month and dined in the upstairs dining room. They have attempted to give the room a facelift but with very poor results. The painting is sloppy and looks (like before) as if it was applied by monkeys. They have purchased a room full of ornate wooden table and chairs that are like torture chamber devices. It is possibly the most uncomfortable furniture I have ever encountered. My party of 6 were all shocked at how uncomfortable the furniture was and I'm telling you it had a negative impact on the dining experience. (Yes - the furniture is so bad it became a topic of conversation) The chairs are too heavy, as uncomfortable and hard as a concrete block, and difficult to move. The ornate details under the table make it difficult to maneuver under the tables. It's a tight little room and for them to have this big blocky heavy furniture makes little or no sense. I'd recommend bringing a seat cushion but then your legs would not fit under the bulky table. Reducing my 5 star rating to 4 stars."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,1,19-Mar-18,"Deep breath 'TOURIST TRAP, TOURIST TRAP!!!!!'   True story I ordered the koftas $12.50. Pretty pricey but hey this place is meant to be good right? Dish arrived and I thought ' erm here is the sauce, where are the koftas?' Dig around with my fork. Found koftas... - two, yes two. Looking at waiter...'erm there's only two koftas here?!' waiter 'erm that's how we do it, I'll see if I can get some more' Returns with one kofta and cuts it it two - I sh^* you not.  Seriously people, do yourself a favour, walk around the back to around the House of Tan Tieng, grab a masala milk for $1.50, a plate of Chenna masala for $1.50 and enjoy the tranquility and food which is heaps better. Hey go crazy, if you spend $5 you will get an absolute feast, or feed the whole family."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,17-Oct-15,"Nicely decorated and air conditioned upstairs, table and chairs are very ornate and clean.  The mixed chicken tikka is heavenly! I ordered it as a starter, ended up getting another order, together with mutton keema naan and sesame naan made a great tandoori meal. Half a mutton seekh kebab has sealed the deal!  Defiantly coming back. This place is good.  In the photo comments, I couldn't edit the iPhone ""autocorrecting"" mutton into mitten! :)"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,20-Jan-18,"Food was EXCELLENT! Service was GREAT! and the restaurant was CLEAN. Recommend chicken tikka masala if you like real spicy and butter milk chocked if you like not so spicy and chicken curry no spicy...and for beers, kingfisher was AWSOME!"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,10-Jul-17,"We found this gem on Yelp. The food was AmaZing and the staff were very attentive and offered some great suggestions. I had the chicken tiki marsala and the agoo gomi (spelling???), a vegetable dish with potatoes, onions, cauliflower, tomatoes and curry. OH My Goodness!"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,3,22-Sep-17,"Was expecting more since it was a 4 star spot. Got the chicken masala and chicken half kebab. There wasn't any chicken in the chicken masala. Like 2 pieces, and everything else was sauce and green pepper vegetables. Lots of seating and friendly staff."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,30-Apr-13,"Yes, yes, yes, yes, YES. The spice, the flavours, the bustling outdoor seating, the naan (oh god the naan), it was like each and every dish they brought out was better than the last.  The menu was a feast in itself - I knew it would be bad (read: really freaking good) when there were 7 types of naan to choose from, but it got to the point where we were all just pointing and shouting and gesticulating wildly. As for the dishes that I dug into? The chicken tikka masala was dark, rich and spicy and the kadahi prawn was easily the best prawn dish I've ever had, but the real stand out was the super decadent chicken mughlayee. It was one of those situations where we wanted everything we saw going out to tables around us, so I doubt you'll go wrong.  We were a bit surprised with the relatively high prices and rather slow food service (waiters were attentive, but it just took a reeeeeally long time for our food to arrive) but the second the food came out, all was forgiven and forgotten. All I can remember now is the food korma I had for the next several hours."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,21-Jun-20,I love all Asian food. This place is very good if you like Indian food. I come here whenever I am home.
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,18-Jan-13,"This is a review of a dinner date at Khansama Tandoori.  http://tinyurl.com/amlyu3s  This is actually my second visit to Khansama. I thought I had previously reviewed it. I uploaded the photos but I must have forgotten to write the review.  I will focus my review on my most recent visit.  Khansama offers street-side outdoor seating and indoor seating (upstairs).  The outdoor seating was mainly full. The restaurant does use staff on the street working very diligently and trying to get customers to eat there.  http://tinyurl.com/aj7amvg  The indoor seating area is quite beautiful. It is an odd combination though. The room is very ornate. The table tops are some type of granite or faux-granite. But the chairs (and the plates) are plastic. The first seat I sat in basically gave way. Luckily, I did not spill onto the floor.  On this evening, the indoor seating area was mainly empty.  http://tinyurl.com/bat3zcx  The staff was friendly, professional, and efficient. They are very attentive and helpful. The order is quickly taken. The food comes out quite fast. They did insure there was a little staging with the starters versus the appetizers. But, like most Indian restaurants, this is a relatively fast paced meal.  I thought the food was pretty good. My dinner companion thought that it was a bit spicy. This included some dishes that are not necessarily usually on the hot side. I expect it from a chicken vindaloo but not necessarily from a prawn masala. I actually didn't find it that spicy though.  The starters were all quite good. I thought the vegetarian samosas, Noor-eh-Elahi, and vegetarian pakora were delicious and also offered nice crisp textures. I was less fond of the paneer pakora. But that is primarily a person taste issue.  http://tinyurl.com/b6as2wq  http://tinyurl.com/bepc73b  http://tinyurl.com/a9xcwkx  For mains to share, I selected chicken vindaloo and prawn masala.  For mains to share, she selected palak paneer and palak chicken. She thought she had ordered only one dish. The ordering was pretty frenzied so I am not sure.  I thought the food was very good. Lol, I especially enjoyed my two selections. The vindaloo was spicy. The chicken was tender. The potatoes were well prepared.  For the prawn masala, the shrimp was also tender and the dish came together quite well.  I only dabbled a bit with her spinach laden selections.  Of course, we also had saffron rice and naan (plain and garlic).  I thought the rice was spot on. The naan was only average. The garlic naan just didn't seem to have that super freshly cooked garlic flavour that really makes great garlic naan great.  http://tinyurl.com/a85z75u  Receipt ($114.00):  You can't really beat getting that much food for $114.  http://tinyurl.com/a85z75u  We had way too much food and unfortunately neither of us are doggy bag people. So, we left a lot of food on the table. That was a shame. I thought it was some pretty good Indian food.  Overall, I like the room. The service was good. I thought the quality of the food was consistently there. I do not think my friend enjoyed it nearly as much. For me, it was a solid 3.5 stars but I rounded up.  (another note, my first experience was very much in-line with my second visit)"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,22-Oct-18,"This place is in the heart of little India. Just a 5 minute walk off the MRT. Covered outdoor seating makes for a very comfortable experience. The food is fantastic and reasonably priced although I'd recommend a party of more than one. Lunch can be pricey if you want to try more than one dish. Not complaining at all however, well worth the higher than usual lunch expense. I can't recommend this place more highly. If you find yourself in Singapore, and you like fantastic Indian cuisine, don't skip this place."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,3,30-Jun-17,Food is okayish Currently under renovation hence even air conditioning room is not so cool. Paneer bhajia and chilli bhajia were good. Butter chicken wasn't good. Service was quick. Nans were soft and yummy. Do compare price/quantity of beer before you order a mug/pitcher/bottle and buy the one that is value for money. Overall just an okayish place.
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,12-Sep-16,Delicious dishes and beautifully decorated. Located in the middle of little India. Waiters were very attentive and helpful in explaining the diversity of dishes. We are very impressed and for sure we'll come back
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,3,17-Mar-16,"First let me say that the food is wonderful, but the service needs CPR. The waiter never smiled and I had to flag him down for water even though he passed me several times seeing an empty glass on the end of the table. It seemed as if he was too busy flirting with the waitress to take care of the customers. Truly, this is my only complaint, but it was definitely aggravating.  Like I said, the food was wonderful and I will probably order delivery from now on from them. Definitely order the king prawns if you go there. You won't be disappointed."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,16-Feb-17,Food and service was amazing. I highly recommend this place also a plus that it was air conditioned.
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,30-Mar-16,"An evening of exploring lead me to this place, of which I can say I ate one of the best Indian meals I have ever had.  You can sit inside, or out on the street - I chose the latter and ordered a beer while I waited for my order to come.  The food came quickly - some mixed vegetable pakoras, mutton vidaloo, and naan. Wowzer, the flavours were spectacular, and the customer service was amazing. I topped it all off with gulab jamun - the traditional Indian desert.  Out of all of the places I ate when I was in Singapore, I will be going back here ASAP. Totally _totally_ worth it."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,27-Dec-18,"Found this place via Yelp. I recommend to sit in the 2nd floor for air conditioning. This restaurant has outstanding food and service. The curry mutton was my favorite dish here. The flavor was very rich, creamy, and extremely flavorful. We also ordered other foods, and they were also very, very fantastic. I definitely recommend this place if you are visiting Singapore and want to find some delicious Indian food. But there is a 10% service charge on the bill."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,22-Jul-16,"I'm a regular at Khansama ever since i moved to Singapore about a year ago. This is my ""Happy Place"". I go here every weekend and atleast twice during the week.  The food: Authentic, yummy, delicious North Indian food. You will *NOT* be disappointed! My favorite order here is the Chicken Tikka Masala with some Kulcha. The meat is always done just right, lots of flavor in portions that aren't too large, and aren't too small. A portion of curry here would serve two people just about.  Recommend: Non Vegetarian: - Chicken Tikka Masala - Mutton Biryani - King Prawns  Vegetarian: - Dal Makhni  Breads: - Masala Kulcha - Rumali Roti   The service:  The staff is very friendly, contrary to other reviews here. Just set up a conversation and remember that this is a very popular restaurant that's packed to the limit almost everyday so they're bound to be a little busy  The chairs:  Oh gawd, this is the worst part! They're not comfortable at all no matter what size you are. There's no clearance between the chair and the table so it's a really awkward way to sit. The food makes it up for everything though :)  Price:  A typical meal for one here without alcohol comes to ~SGD $28 - $35. Remember to pay with ""Nets"" which is a state controlled payment method that has no fees compared to Visa which will tack on a few more dollars ;)"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,5-Sep-15,"So far, my fav restaurant in Little India. I have been here a couple of times, and will be back for more... Anything from the tandoori oven is great, as well as lamb dishes ...and the dal makhani. Rice biriani also good. Butter chicken may be the only thing so far that was just meh.  About the venue: I have to say that the fact that there are no windows in the upstairs room is a bit strange! :-)"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,30-May-16,"Excellent quick service, I had so many people waiting on me at the rush hour I was amazed. The food was great and I even ordered more to take home with me. I tried the mutton curry and it was excellent. I ended up bringing some chicken home with me and it was awesome.  I definitely will be eating at this place again."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,25-Jun-15,Very good tandoori chicken that goes great with the Strong indian beer (Haywards 5000). This is how the food is cooked back in a tandoori restaurant in India. Very good mughlai pasanda (better than the usual butter chicken which is good in itself).  Good Indian food like the one in India. Reasonable pricing too.
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,21-Nov-17,"We went here for lunch on a Friday afternoon. It wasn't crowded. We were seated upstairs. They have two options - upstairs has ac and downstairs just fans. It was a hot and humid day in Singapore so we decided to sit upstairs. They have a lot of items in their menu. It will take you sometime to go through it to make a choice. We ordered starters and main course. Food was good, but it was pricey. Service was quick and the place was clean but nothing fancy."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,15-Apr-18,Awesome Flavors (flavours) central Little India! Portion sizes are perfect for sharing. Great drive menu. Top notch service!!!
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,6-Feb-18,"Khansma delivers and it is oh so good, chicken tikka, samosas, lassis, tandoori Chicken, biryani rice all are so yummy. Love being able to call up and have this delivered to my place."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,21-Aug-18,"Every dish we got was excellent: vegetable pakora, agra chaat, garlic naan, fish tikka and aloo matter. Service was quick and attentive."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,21-Dec-14,"Made a walk down to little India and stopped at Khansama tandoori for a bite to eat with friends. The butter chicken, lamb rogan josh, tandoori chicken, samosas, lamb boti kebab and chicken tikka masala were all amazing. Also should point out it was the most reasonably priced meal we had all week and it was the best. A couple Heineken and a curry. Does it get much better than that. Atmosphere was awesome sitting on the patio with all of the activity of the streets of little India around you."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,1-Oct-16,"Food was good and price was not bad.  We ordered 2x naan, vegetable samosa, tikki, butter chicken, and mutton masala, and it was just below $50.  Butter chicken was a bit too sweet and masala was a bit too salty and naan came in cold though.  Overall Verdict: 4 Taste: 4 Amount: 3 Price: 4 Atmosphere: 3"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,22-Oct-16,"We had the samosa, butter chicken sauce, garlic naan and butter roti and everything was delicious. The decor is pretty traditional with givers crowd."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,12-May-16,"Upon searching Yelp for a good Indian restaurant in the area, the family and I stumbled upon this place! And boy, what a great find on a Thursday night! Amazingly flavorful, perfect amount of spice, and so much bang for your buck. I highly recommend this place to anyone craving solid northern Indian food in the area and beyond. Highlights included the mixed vegetable pakora, prawn masala, chicken tikka, and the heavenly crispy/buttery/light butter naan!"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,19-Jun-17,"Unattentive, on the verge of being rude, but that might just be their regular everyday attitude. Aside from that, really good food."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,18-Jul-12,A place that has wicked kebabs and butter chicken. This the best kebab place i know in singapore. All of their dishes are pretty rich and fattening with lots of butter and good stuff. However i must confess between my second last trip and my last trip i did feel like the quality of the food went down while the price went up. I might have gone on the wrong day. However i am generally a big fan of the quality of food here. The prices are not too cheap. The staff is friendly and the ambience is pretty nice.
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,28-Sep-16,"Mom and I went in for an early dinner while here in Singapore...we were seriously craving some good Indian food. Well, we found it! The Kahali Prawns and Curry Chicken were delicious. Perfectly spiced, good sized portions. The naan bread was good too. The server, however was not very friendly at all. No smiles, had to flag him down constantly. But maybe after our week in the land of smiles, Thailand, it was more noticable lol!"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,27-Jun-17,This place is popular among tourists and has really great paneer dishes. 10/10 would visit again!
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,23-May-19,Not usually the biggest Indian food lover but Wow was this place awesome. Just happened to stubble upon the restaurant walking down little India. Everyone ordered something different and we all shared and loved it. Services super nice will come back. Best food in SIN.
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,10-Jan-16,"Fantastic Restaurant, in almost every way. We stopped in here after some Diwali shopping and were happy to escape the heat and crowds by heading upstairs to the air conditioned dining room."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,13-Jun-17,"I've gone there twice in a week because I was a big fan of their food. I am a big fan of their Paneer Kadai, Chicken Masala and Egg Curry. They are such great dishes to have with basamti rice. I think it is quite a bit much to charge a bowl of basamati rice for $5, while the egg curry is only priced at $7. It is better to go in a group of four or more to experience different dishes. We have experienced different types of service here. My initial experience was quite bad; the guy insisted that we drink from bottled water ($2) instead of offering us tap water though we asked for tap water. (It made it worse when the table beside ours got tap water just fine.) When I told him the situation, he seemed sour! Though I could easily give 5 stars for their food, their service varies and could be a letdown at times."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,27-Nov-15,"We're Americans living in Singapore. We decided to have our Thanksgiving dinner at Khansama Tandoori, because we are very thankful for Indian food and we have heard good things about this restaurant. When we first arrived, our server seemed a little unfriendly, but he warmed up to us. I could not remember what palak paneer was called, but he knew as soon as I described it and added it to our order. We also tried the butter chicken, the assorted tandori and the butter and cheese naan breads. Everything was delicious and the atmosphere was comfortable, clean and very nicely decorated. There is also a fairly well stocked bar as well as a descent house white wine. I would happily recommend this restaurant, and only suggest that you prepare to leave very full."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,5-Oct-18,"Easy to find and well worth the trip to Little India. Food is delicious. I had butter chicken, which was yummy and had the right amount of spice. Should've skipped the rice. The naan is fabulous!"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,2-Aug-18,"A fantastic restaurant with wonderful spicy food. The service is fast, efficient and spot on. You will not regret taking the time to try this place out."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,25-Feb-15,"The food is good especially the kebabs, however a special mention has to be the chicken roll they are authentic and remind me of the rolls found in New Delhi .... A must have here"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,21-Jan-18,Eaten here on two separate trips both time the food was very good and nice staff. Sitting on the street Sunday afternoon watching the people. Very relaxing
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,1,1-Jul-18,The worst delivery service ever possible. In addition the attitude of the staff is worst I have come across. They promise to deliver within 90 mins and it doesn't even arrive in 2 hours. They have the audacity to say - please cancel the order. No concerns for the customer whatsoe
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,1,20-Apr-18,The worst delivery service ever possible. In addition the attitude of the staff is worst I have come across. They promise to deliver within 90 mins and it doesn't even arrive in 2 hours. They have the audacity to say - please cancel the order. No concerns for the customer whatsoever.
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,3,5-Jul-17,"Nothing great just average food. Service was very good. AC is not effective unless you are sitting right next to it. They have a desert cooler in the same hall, not sure how AC is suppose to work with water cooler in the same room( one is a humidifier and other dehumidifier:-)) Saw good reviews so decided to try but was a bit disappointed"
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,22-Jul-16,Awesome food. Tandoori perfect amount of spice. Curry excellent and service was great!! From USA so owner was extremely helpful with what to order.
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,5,6-Oct-15,"To notch north Indian cuisine! Had the tandoori chicken, pakoras, mushroom mataar and a tomato based shrimp dish (forgot the name, sorry). All was superb. WARNING though, I ordered this sour and salty herbal drink out of curiosity. It was described as a digestive drink. It is a VERY acquired taste, aka it tastes awful. Be warned."
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,2,7-Nov-15,The food is great but it's pricey and the waiting times ruin the fun. Be prepared to wait 20/30 mins for food to be served. Even an extra bread could be an extra 10 mins.
Khansama Tandoori,4.2,70,Indian,4,3-Sep-13,"Food was very good. The chicken masala was overdominated by Green Peppers which neither of us enjoyed. The butter chicken, rice and Naan were excellent"
Il Fiore,4,2,Italian,4,3-May-14,"This is really more of a 3.5 star place, but it has some positives going for it so I'll give it a 4.  It can be a bit hard to find if you're not familiar with the Raffles Place area. If you're coming from the MRT, I would take Exit A/B, go past Chevron House (but away from One Raffles Place) and when you see the CIMB branch, find the staircase, go down, and it will be there.  When my husband told me to meet him and a few of his colleagues here for drinks on a Friday night, I scoffed because I thought, ""I've never heard of this place, it's in the basement level, and it's probably lame."" However, it surprised me. The wine, though nothing special, was reasonably priced per glass (around $13-15) and my linguine alla carbonara was quite delicious. Despite it being pretty busy, it didn't take too long for my food to come out.  In addition to Italian food, they also serve some Chinese dishes. I know it sounds a bit strange, but apparently the locals say it's pretty solid. According to one of Miguel's colleagues, he tried their foie gras fried rice and loved it, but it might've been a seasonal dish as it wasn't on the menu and our server didn't seem to know what it was. Miguel did try the pork belly fried rice and thought it was top notch.  Maybe lunch is a different story, but for dinner, the restaurant seems to exude this sleaziness that I can't explain. Perhaps it's because we're in the basement and there's no windows? Or maybe it's the clientele (mostly businessmen) added in with the mostly female staff (but in their defense, they don't dress like sluts.) Then there's the decor- yes, Botticelli's ""Birth of Venus"" is a tasteful nude... but when an almost-nude photo of the owner is included in the mix*, well... what are we supposed to think?  Despite all of that, I did enjoy the food and I appreciated the relaxed atmosphere at the start of the weekend. To be honest, I wouldn't mind coming back so I could sample that pork belly fried rice!  --  *To her credit, she did look good in that photo and she still looks good now. Apparently, if you ask her, she is willing to pose next to you if you want to take a picture with it."
Il Fiore,4,2,Italian,4,29-Apr-15,"A true local joint in the middle of Raffles Place. It's the only place I know in the heart of the business district where you can get great local food past 9pm. The Salted Fish fried rice is amazing. Honestly, any of the fried rice dishes are a good bet. The Bee Hoon and the Char Kway Teow are decent, especially late at night when you are trying to find something to hold you over after a night of drinking.  Located at the basement of the Singapore Land Tower (or next door at the very least), this is a no frills drinking establishment. You come here for two main purposes: (i) too drink amongst friends and (ii) to try out the surprisingly good Asian cuisine -- yes, I know the place is Italian, but the Asian / SG food is soo much better!  P.S there is a sexy painting of the owner (scantily clad) hanging right next to the bar. It's a pretty cute touch, if you ask me. :D"
Jai's Thai-Vientiane Cuisine,5,1,Thai,5,28-Jul-15,"Absolutely the best Thai food in the neighborhood coffee shops! The prices are reasonable and the portions are huge! More for big diet people. My first time ordering their Basil Chicken rice and I couldn't finish it! The queue is always long during meal times. What I like is that we can call in advance to order the food! Very friendly service.  They have a wide range of menu ranging from salads, soups, main course to desserts! They operate till 8.30pm on weekdays.  Absolutely a must return for us!"
Sidewalk Food Place,4,1,Food Court,4,12-Nov-18,"For those hunting the laksa at Funan Digital Life Mall, I think this place is the replacement! Food centre next door at Peninsula has limited options but is functional for the quick bite - a chicken rice, noodle/rice, soup/noodle, and drinks place (beer, sodas, some fruits, soy milk, limited selection)!"
The Garden @ Sentosa,5,2,Modern European,5,26-Dec-19,"Not sure if this is the standard format, but on the night we were there, they had a buffet for everything except the main (which had a steak, chicken, or seafood option). I had a fillet and a creamy cabbage soup. A lot of fancy restaurants use a lot of butter to prepare soups and steaks, but there was barely a hint of it in either dish. In addition to the excellent soup (which my wife and I both went for seconds), the buffet had a great amuse-bouche, a Thai pasta dish, and several salads; and for dessert, they had three cute holiday themed cakes. Overall, the food, service, and ambiance were all five star, and in my opinion, The Garden was the best from our Singapore vacation, beating out a Michelin restaurant from the night before."
The Garden @ Sentosa,5,2,Modern European,5,15-May-17,"Singapore is a tough place to find organic food. Luckily i found this gem in Sentosa. It's next to the spa in Sofitel. The Gardens have an awesome ambiance (pool with waterfalls), their food is mostly organic and some are gluten-free. Definitely coming back here everyday for the rest of my trip."
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,5,3-Sep-23,"Was looking forward to this day at Waku Ghin - 2 Michelin Star establishment. From the moment you walk in to the very end, it was amazing except for the check...Lol. The guest services was excellent and exceptional! One of my guest phone battery was about to go kaput, they provided a charger to for him...Wow! The staff was very knowledgeable on the dishes and history behind it. We ere seated at Chef private table.  All the dishes was amazing and very rich....lots of caviar and truffles. This is not your traditional omakase, pricing for this seating was S$700++ per person (US$600). Total 12 dishes and 3 desserts. We had a bottle of clear unfiltered sake specially made for Chef Wakuda. After dinner, we moved into a more private room to finish up on dessert. Overall it was a wonderful experience!"
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,1,31-Jan-23,"For this US $1000 meal, we provide two reviews both concluding that this meal was awful. Dimitri's: Absolutely NOT recommended. Very uncomfortable seating. Very cold room even after we complained and they offered a shawl. Ingredients came from far away and therefore must be expensive. Only 10 people for a single seating per evening with 2 chefs and much staff - adding to the expense. As soon as you sat down, they tried to upgrade you from the S$ 550 that you reserved to a premium ingredient menu at S$ 750. Very off-putting. The food was nice but with no WOW factor. Too many ingredients in a single dish: uni is great by itself, why do you need Oscietra caviar with it, and also some shrimp? By the way, the uni is not fresh - it is flown frozen from Hokkaido and then defrosted in Singapore. Why do we have to move to a different room for the dessert? That room was also very cold although we had been told it would be warmer there. Definitely not worth the price!  Audre: we had been looking forward to sampling Tetsuya's food since we missed his restaurant in Sydney in 2005. So, about 20 years later we decided to spring for the US$1000 meal and experience what people were raving about. This was not a meal by a great chef. This was a meal in which the price charged was being justified by adding fancy ingredients on top of fancy ingredients. No dish exalted the ingredients. Whatever happened to creating dishes to permit the flavors of the main ingredient to shine? Whatever happened to providing comfort for the guests: even little Audre had her knees up against the back of the counter (in order to be close enough to the counter to eat). Even Audre was freezing in the room. The chef on our side of the counter, Che Meing, was catty and fun but he had only been working 10 years. Maybe Chef Tetsuya is no longer cooking, but we would have been more impressed with a veteran chef. Instead of listing all of the dishes, this will highlight a few: the Avruga Flan was a take on chawan mushi. It was an okay substitute but we asked ourselves: ""why substitute--just make a sublime chawan mushi?"" The dish described as ""pur¨¦e of potato with soft poached egg, winter black truffle and Oscietra caviar"" was ludicrous. Why have truffle and caviar? Oh, because the black truffle was tasteless! The pan-seared Korean Abalone, from Jeju no less, was tender and good but was too huge a piece for that stage of the menu. The dishes that followed were Canadian lobster and Japanese Wagyu beef. The dishes for dessert were not outstanding. We know how expensive Japanese strawberries are but the ones served were not tasty and were not red all the way through. The menu called for a ""Paris Brest"" as one of the desserts. We had to ask because we couldn't find it on our dessert plate. It was smaller than a thimble and was nothing special. The Shencha tea was tasteless. Oh man; we were so disappointed and we spent S$1306.80/US $997.56. We think that the entire concept of the restaurant needs to be re-thought. If the only way to keep the chefs from melting is to have the guests freeze, then this arrangement of having the chefs cooking behind the counter where the guests eat must be changed. The sourcing of the ingredients should also undergo assessment. And the mounding of expensive ingredients on top of expensive ingredients should be eliminated. In addition, the reservation process was excruciatingly painful and annoying."
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,5,30-Mar-19,"I was able to fortuitously find a seat in this temple of Japanese inspired cuisine in Singapore, but you should book weeks in advance if you want a seat. They only serve 20 customers at a time, in small 6 people dining rooms in front of a grill and your own chef.  Dinner is omakase only with a price tag of 400SGD plus tax, and of course you may wish to pair it with wines (a wine pairing where every dish comes with a recommended wine or sake costs additional 250SGD).  Service is elegant but also extremely personal. Since I was dining alone, my server made a point to strike conversation a couple of times, gently and always respectfully. I really appreciated the tone and the courtesy of all the servers.  The dinner starts with impressive raw seafood dishes, among which I certainly was amazed by their signature dish, a composition of sea urchin (uni), shrimp and caviar. One of the most delicious dishes I ever had, and I traveled extensively in Japan tasting some of the best kaiseki ryori in the country. Other gems followed: tagliolini with caviar and freshly grated truffle. Abalone gently grilled and then smoked in front of us with cherry blossoms (!). A bouillabaisse of lobster. Delight after delight, concluded by a delicious and delicate ochazuke.  Each dish was expertly described, along with suggestions to enjoy its flavor at the best.  After dinner, each party is moved to their own table, together with people from the other rooms, in another common dining space overlooking the marina and the famous Singapore skyline, not to mention the light and fountain show. Here delicious desserts are served (pre dessert, main and petit four, in a very customary sequence).  In summary, this was a masterpiece dining experience, flawless from start to finish in all its most minute details. The price tag is serious, but I am not regretting a single dollar at the end of this sumptuous dinner."
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,5,12-Dec-18,"TLDR: bar service was great.  This review is for the bar service and not the 10 course meal. My wife and I came in the evening on a weekday and were promptly greeted and seated. Our server was knowledgeable about all the dishes and amply explained things. I ended up getting their pear fruit cocktail and a melon cocktail (underneath their Japanese fruit cocktail section) which were both delectable. We split the lobster spaghetti, Wagyu chim over rice and the fried chicken. The Wagyu was so wonderfully fatty you could feel you're gallbladder contract after eating it.  I was only here on vacation but next time I might plan ahead for the 10 course meal which looks incredible. Per my server it's usually a one or two weeks advance reservation but call in case there's openings the night of."
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,5,23-Dec-18,"Omg one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. First to start... just walking into this place feels VIP... and the cocktails are phenomenal.  The muscat cocktail was my favorite to start with, and the Japanese peach.  We were seated in the bar area first and when our private room was ready, we went in. It's pretty amazing that everyone gets a chefs table seat and you get to watch majority of the food prepared in front of you.  It's an omakase that consists of fresh seafood and some meat. Dietary requests can be accommodated as well. But I myself don't have any so I just go with whatever the suggest.  Chef Tetsuya is mega famous and he is literally the god father of soooooo many world renowned talented chefs. I honestly don't even know if he knows how many of his offspring are very successful chefs with multiple restaurants under their belts in highly populated cities. I've been to many Tetsuya offspring restaurants, so although it was my first time eating at his restaurant and even though it was prepared by one of his chefs and not him, the dishes were embraced by my palette.  I left this restaurant soooo happy. Even though we came to celebrate my hubby's bday... I felt like it was mine. Every dish was beyond amazing.  I am a big fan of the abalone, the prawn and the Wagyu cooked to perfection as well as their signature dish... the sea urchin, baby Shrimp & Caviar. Just stunning. The seafood bouboulaise with bread was also excellent. I hope to come back sometime in this lifetime!"
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,5,29-May-19,"Waku Ghin is a phenomenal meal.  The Uni is obviously the stand out dish, but on reflection, every course is exquisite in its own fashion. The seared Amadai had a smokey crispness, the Wagyu was divine and deserts superb.  It ended up $600pp (incl 2 glasses of wine each.) This is a crazy expensive meal - and there are more affordable tasting menus elsewhere. However, if you love seafood, you can't miss this meal."
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,3,30-Dec-14,"Never thought I would say this, but I found a downside to spontaneity. And that is: can't get reservations anywhere!  So I figured I'll just eat at the bar. It's a la carte at the bar. There's both counter and tables at the bar. Ordered the steak. It was okay. The sauce was too sweet, which really did not help bring out the flavor of the steak. Normally I love sweet sauce on anything, so I don't know what they did wrong with this sauce. Just didn't go.  Perhaps, the food is better not at the bar, but after this steak, I'm not dying to come back."
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,5,13-Feb-16,There is a reason why this place is ranked as one of the Top 50 restaurants in the world. A culinary experience not to be missed!
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,3,28-Sep-14,"I guess our expectations were different and we didn't have the required refined tastes to enjoy the meal.  We were a party of 6, had the omakase ofc, some v expensive sake, and 6xS$20 of still water?!?  Overall i was dissapointed. Maybe I did not enjoy the subtleness of the 10 well-presented courses enough but honestly I was expecting to be wowed but in the end I came away with 3000 reasons why I could have eaten elsewhere for 5* food but much much better value.  The uni was decent and the a5 wagyu was ok but everything else was sub-par and honestly not worth the $400++ £¨don't forget gst + service) we paid per person. However our chef from Japan was a highlight in an otherwise mediocreally-supposed ta be-haute-gastronomic experience.  Like the new hublot ferrari engine watch. Or not.  O well. At least they had phone charger for my poor Android phone..  *also was expecting like otoro or some other sashimi :(( but o well i guess u can't choose in omakase."
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,4,9-Oct-12,"Waku Ghin. Constantly one of frontrunners for 'Best Restaurant in Singapore', a meal there will set you back a cool $400++ per head, not counting water or wine. Even then, I'm going to say it's worth going at least once.  Each course is a myriad of flavours and textures, all meant to bring out the natural flavours of the ingredients in as dazzling a way as possible. The signature dish of marinated botan ebi, sea urchin, and oscietra caviar, is salty yet sweet, clean tasting yet rich. And amazingly, it wasn't even my favourite dish. Personally I felt that it was just a little too ostentatious, a little too opulent.  The charcoal grilled beef served with mustard was real delight, the beef was full-flavoured and the smoky flavour of the grill lingered in the most teasing of ways. Every time a dish came in a broth, we ended up drinking from the bowl, because apparently spoons weren't always part of the dining experience... but the amount of time and quality of ingredients that went into each of those nourishing liquids must have been significant, because they were all packed with flavour.  Dessert... was a little lacklustre. After the brilliance of the courses before it, the simple coconut mousse with mango was almost insipid by comparison, and a rather disappointing portion size at that.  One thing I must highlight however, is that the service really impressed. It wasn't as subtle or unobtrusive as I've experienced at other top-class restaurants, but they did manage one thing that sets them apart from any other dining experience I've had in Singapore. They noticed I was left-handed, and proceeded to place all the cutlery as a left-hander would use it (opposite of the normal place settings). I've never had that ever happen in Singapore (overseas yes), and that alone redeemed the seamless but average service we received for the rest of the evening."
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,5,15-Apr-15,"My life is complete...  I ate off of the bar menu at Waku Ghin because the actual meal was definitely out of my price range. Even though the bill still came out to about $300 USD for 2 people, this is likely one of the best food-related choices I have ever made in my life. From the drinks to the food, everything was top-notch. Just as I thought I had reached ecstasy, the next bite always proved me wrong.  We ordered 3 dishes: Lobster open face sandwich, sea urchin set on vinegared rice with caviar, Spaghettini with Alaskan King Crab & Tomato. I've sat around for 30 minutes thinking about how to describe these dishes, but I simply can't find the words to justify how good they were. The Spaghettini is the most ordinary and replicable dish here. The Lobster sandwich and uni/caviar were out of this world, and completely indescribable.  We also had 2-3 drinks each. I ordered various sake cocktails, all of which required an amazing level of creativity to create. I have never seen or had sake cocktails in America, so this was refreshing and intriguing for me. My girlfriend ordered 3 fresh fruit cocktails. Each of them were blended into a smoothie, but were also unique in its own way. The passion fruit cocktail was blended with real passion fruit so the freshness of the fruit and the seed were all infused into the drink. The grapefruit cocktail had separate and distinct pulps that exploded in your mouth as you drink and popped them. The bartenders here really outdid themselves.  I apologize for my inability to do justice in describing the food. However, I can confidently say that this was the best meal I have ever had - - which is incredible because the food was ordered off of its bar menu."
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,5,24-Apr-15,"KenScale: 9.5/10  The best meal I had during my stay in Singapore also happened to be the most expensive one. I wouldn't say that a more expensive meal would necessarily be the best, but the one I had at Waku Ghin was just absolutely fantastic. I would definitely say it's one of my all-time best Japanese meals of my lifetime. Located inside the famed Marina Bay Sands hotel (where I stayed just so I could check out the fabulous infinity pool) and helmed by internationally acclaimed chef Tetsuya Wakuda, Waku Ghin has long been one of the pillars of the great gastronomic scene.  At Waku Ghin, you will get seated at a counter where a chef comes out to serve 10-course degustation menu, priced at whopping S$400 per person (thank god the dollar to Singapore dollar exchange rate during my visit was as favorable as it could get!). The chef will bring a gigantic plate of all the raw seafood that will be a part of your meal. With that price tag, each dish really had to be worth every penny, which is a nearly impossible feat, yet Waku Ghin pulled this out beautifully. There were some really taste bites of seafood, from Japanese sawara (mackerel) that worked beautifully with eggplant and seaweed vinaigrette to slow-cooked New Zealand John Dory with grilled eggplant to roasted New Zealand scampi. One of the signature dishes at the restaurant, the marinated shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served inside the sea urchin shell was pure nirvana, and I could seriously eat this dish any given day. The best dish in my mind, however, was the impeccable Tasmanian abalone that came with fregola pasta and tomato. It showed that the restaurant could also draw a page from Western influence, and I still can't forget the beautifully cooked abalone that worked wonders with the pasta. I was also deeply impressed with the braised Canadian lobster that came with aromatic tarragon jus. Lobster was as perfectly cooked as it ever gets, and the tarragon jus worked its magic to further add another dimension to the dish. An assortment of fabulous seafood was followed by some meat dishes. Deboned spatchcock (chicken) was well-cooked and worked harmoniously with black truffle. My only compliant with wagyu roll was that there was too little of it, but otherwise the meat's texture was absolutely juicy and tender. Following a serving of soothing somen and gyokuro (green tea), I was led to the main dining area where desserts started coming in. Tasmanian leatherwood honey ice cream with granite of lemon and gin jelly, a light and refreshing dish, was followed by Ghin cheesecake (""Ghin"" stands for silver in Japanese), another winning dessert that I wished I could have more of.  The restaurant has a classy and formal vibe but I still saw families with casual apparel enjoying their casual time together. The services of the professionally dressed staffs were attentive, and you can complement your meal with a variety of drinks from wine to sake to cocktails. Waku Ghin will blow your mind if you're looking for a serious Japanese fare with Western touches. I've always been impressed with the craftsmanship, dedication and discipline that Japanese chefs display, and while the glitzy atmosphere of Marina Bay Sands may make you think the meal at Waku Ghin is overpriced and overrated, it is anything but. Okay, maybe the price may force you to eat cheap food for the next month or so, but if you're looking for a once-in-a-lifetime meal, Waku Ghin is pretty damn close!"
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,4,22-Aug-14,"dear wakuda san,  i hope this letter finds you well.  my father won big by taking germany to win the world cup and so was able to dine in your restaurant last night. coincidentally, it was his birthday but alas he dined WITHOUT ME, as he said you were too expensive for kids to tag along:(  the first thing he said, when i saw him this morning was,""son, you need to study really hard and make sure that you can speak clearly and communicate properly!"" i was perplexed. but apparently, the uncles and aunties who served him last night weren't able to do so without him constantly having to ask them to repeat what they said, again and again. despite that, service was still good but communications was a big F. i guess your exquisite culinary creations have to speak for themselves?!  the awkward teppanyaki counter setup further detracted from the dining experience as it proved more of an obstacle to service rather than a chance to showcase your gourmet menu. frankly speaking, there were no knives flying nor fancy schmancy cooking skills that warrants the teppanyaki counter's existence. anything he had, from the teppan, could easily have been cooked in the kitchen. the only good thing about it was he got to snap more shots for posting on Yelp! he also mentioned another uncle customer commented on how you no longer cook your abalone dish at the counter anymore. so it's just the canadian lobster, tasmanian cape grim beef and japanese ohmi wagyu beef that benefited from the under utilized, obtrusive teppan. you are probably better off without it!  BUT obviously, he LOVED your food! 5 stars for that alone! he flew to sydney just to dine at your flagship restaurant and has been ever so effusive about your delicate cooking that incorporates the best produce and is always full of flavours! just check out his gazillion photos(when he gets round to uploading them all) and you can't help but click on 'LIKE'! he said that it looks as good as it tastes or is it the other way around?!  anyway, just when he thought dinner was over, you moved him into a much cosier environment for his just desserts! the pre-dessert kyoho grapes and granita was simple but amazing, so sweet yet with a tinge of sour and the icy granita kept those seedless halves just firm enough before melting away in your mouth! the dessert proper was a mango passion fruit cremet d'anjou, not properly explained and he had to refer to the menu they printed out for him, it was quality but nothing mind blowing. then he was surprised with what looks like your signature chocolate cake with perfectly scribbled chocolate birthday wishes! thank you for saving me the trouble of having to buy him a birthday cake! i mean the cake i buy, can never come close to the velvety finish that he mentioned in passing. finally, your petit cinq completed a lovely evening of gastronomy. even though he was so full, he still popped every single one into his mouth instead of bringing some home for me!:(  uncle, you kept him away for a good 3 hours but that was a good thing as it allowed the bottle of tsuki no katsura iwaimai, nigori, junmai daiginjo to vanish and for him to depart on a sake high.  thank you for making it an overall memorable evening for him.  yours sincerely, nik junior  p.s. hopefully, he does not have to wait till the next world cup to be back again!;)"
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,4,14-Sep-15,"Waku Ghin is a great restaurant with a plethora of flavors to keep your taste buds busy. It will also make you feel as inflated as a blimp afterwards since it's just so much food. Also, be sure to set aside 3.5 to 4 hours to dine here, it's long. Took off a star because I was only wow'd by one of the courses and drinks are below mediocre. Most of the dishes are good, but not memorable.  I've been here on two separate occasions. Once I came alone after a friend was stuck at work and the second time with my girlfriend on one of our first dates. You walk into the casino area of MBS and are pleasantly welcomed by the staff as they open the doors for you and and seat you to your room where you will sit alongside 2-3 other couples (was a bit awkward when I came solo).  Your chef comes into the room and introduces himself along with what he calls the ""menu"", or simply a showcase of the fish that will be prepared for the meal. You say OK and move on with your culinary journey.  Both of my experiences, I had essentially the same dishes (I believe it was the same season in two different years since the menu changes by season). I had the following (out of order unfortunately)  1) Shrimp with sea urchin and caviar served in a sea urchin shell (their signature dish) - Excellent as one would expect 2) Ocean trout with witlof and yuzu - Ok 3) Beef with arugula - Simple but meat was cooked nicely 4) Lobster in a garlic type sauce - This was very nicely done 5) King crab leg cooked and covered over a bed of salt and bamboo leaf - This is the one dish that stood out for me. Easily my favorite and one I could rave about. 6) Live steamed abalone served with fregola - Pretty much your typical abalone dish but with a slight twist. 7) Japanese Waygu beef slice with garlic chips and fresh wasabi - Nice 8) Consomme with rice and snapper - Good 9) Somen with myoga and junsai - Nice refreshing dish 10) Honey ice cream with gin and lemon jelly - Sweet yet easy to eat 11) Cheesecake - Unfortunately was just a cheesecake.  My girlfriend and I both had cocktails which to me were both pretty bad. We even went to the bar after and had drinks there and they were mediocre at best. For a bar that advertises itself throughout the hotel, they really aren't that good. Wish we stuck with sake.  After these experiences, I really wasn't that wow'd. Most of the flavors are those you can find if you have any of these fish at other restaurants, except the king crab leg which blew my mind. The setting and setup are all very cool but I definitely left hoping for much more that I didn't get and I can only imagine that these guys will get better. Most of the dishes again are good but not great and memorable.  If Michelin came to Singapore, these guys would for sure be in the mix for a potential 3 stars since they fit the criteria but they need to build more dishes with truly unique and memorable flavors. Otherwise, I think it's worth a shot to try it out for the experience."
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,5,11-Feb-17,"Amazing food, great service and superb wine pairing. My favorite was the cold noodle at the end of the meal. It was surprising refreshing."
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,5,8-Jan-13,"In the world of celebrity chefs, Tetsuya Wakuda is up there with the best in the world. Many of us have had the privilege of dining at his Sydney restaurant, Tetsuya's, but how many of us have had the opportunity to dine at his Singapore restaurant, Waku Ghin? Well, now, I can add myself to those lucky people.  Waku Ghin, translates to 'arise silver' and pays homage to Tetsuya's routes, offering a 10 course Japanese inspired degustation menu. The restaurant is located in the iconic Marina Bay Sands complex, and offers a unique dining experience. In fact, Waku Ghin was just voted in the 2012 S. Pellegrino Top 50 restaurants of the world. Now, that's an achievement!  The experience of Waku Ghin starts the moment you walk through the doors and are greeted by the attentive staff. To the left is an impressive sake bar and caviar lounge, perfect for pre-dinner drinks.  Continue through the restaurant, and you are greeted by a curved timber walled hallway, with private Teppanyaki rooms situated off to each side. Understated elegance is the theme and though it is impressive to say the least, there is nothing ostentatious about the space. Warm timber compliments features of slick silver, with ornate vases and ornaments cleverly lit to create the perfect ambiance , alongside glimpses of the Singapore skyline.  The restaurant seats only 25 people at a time, offering 2 sittings each evening. Guests are seated in private Teppanyaki rooms. This evening, Mr J and I have our own personal Teppanyaki chef, dedicated to creating our 10 course degustation menu. We share our Teppanyaki room with another couple, who also have their own personal chef.  The 10 course degustation menu is tailored to your individual taste on the evening, and our chef takes the time to discuss our menu with us. I should also note, you will not be disappointed with the extensive wine list. If you can't find something to tickle your fancy, then you're not looking hard enough. With our wine and food sorted, we proceed to sit back, relax and soak up the amazing experience of dining at Waku Ghin.  Our menu: * 'Like Oyster' - Scallop with Daikon and Oyster Leaf * Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar * Grilled Tailfish with Japanese Matsutake * Pan-Seared Foie Gras with Kyoho * Australian Abalone with Fregola and Tomato * Braised Canadian Lobster with Tarragon * Charcoal Grilled Australian Lamb with Couscous * Japanese Ohmi Wagyu Roll from Shiga Prefecture with Wasabi and Citrus Soy * Scampi Pasta * Gyokuro  Our dining experience commences with our chef showing us the seafood we are about to eat. I can't help but notice the poor little lobsters are still alive! At least we know it's fresh!  Our chef then proceeds to expertly prepare for us each dish, one at a time, carefully explaining the dish as he goes along. I love the personal interaction with the chef, and revel in the opportunity to watch the expert preparation up close and personal.  Each dish is perfectly presented and looks as much a piece of art, as a plate of food. Each mouthful is accompanied by the raising of my eyebrows and an animated 'wow' coming out of my mouth! Time and time again, every one of those 10 courses achieves the same reaction.  Once our degustation is complete, we are escorted to a separate room to retire for our dessert. The room offers spectacular views of the Singapore skyline.  Our dessert menu: * Cold Soup of Dates with Tonka Bean Ice Cream and Orange * Pistachio Ice Cream with Raspberry and Chantilly * Coffee or Tea and Petit Fours  The desserts do not disappoint and cap off a perfectly enchanting evening. We are each presented with a personal menu, dated and detailing our food and wine choices for the evening. A lovely touch and memento.  Though pricey, dining at Waku Ghin is an amazing experience. From the food, to the decor, to the service. This is seamless top class dining. This is an experience I am going to remember for a long time to come."
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,4,9-Sep-12,"A place for high-rollers  At $400 per head before taxes, Waku Ghin is a big commitment even before you start your dinner. (And yes, they take your credit card upon reservation - if you don't show up, they deduct the price anyway).  The set-up of the 25-seater restaurant is sparse and muted. The main element is silver (ghin), which apparently is chef's favourite. Diners perch on uncomfortable bar stools for most of the 2-hour+ /10-course meal before moving to the lounge to be served a sliver of dessert. Service is not up to par as expected - having told the receptionist that I was dining there on occasion of my birthday, we were greeted with complete indifference, not even an acknowledgement of the big day. No matter. The non-existent service throughout the meal at least meant we weren't bothered by inept staff.  The food is top notch, comprising ingredients that are at the very top of their category and treated minimally at the teppan counter. The private chef - one to every 2 diners - does a show and tell for his dishes before preparing it, whether searing a piece of wagyu or cooking the abalone to the perfect texture. Some dishes are prepared in the kitchen, such as the signature of botan shrimp and creamy Hokkaido sea urchin. The customised teppan plate is truly the star - having your food cooked before your eyes does much to whet the appetite.  For normal folks, Waku Ghin is a one-time splurge, but high rollers apparently dine there weekly - so I guess the standard of the food will always be high. Just know what to expect (it's not haute gastronomy the likes of Restaurant Andre or Jaan) and you'll probably enjoy your $400 worth of prime ingredients, done well."
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,5,22-Jan-13,"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Singapore. the ambiance and the food, defines what good dining experience should be. It is expensive and reservations are hard to come by, but its worth it."
Waku Ghin,4.4,21,Asian Fusion,5,20-Jul-16,"Located in the glitzy expanse of Marina Bay Sands, Waku Ghin definitely offers culinary decadence. The experience is without a doubt very expensive but the 10 course degustation meal was hands down among my favorite of all time.  I am certain that I can't describe the plates any better than the previous reviews have. However, I can confidently say that the food tastes as good as the descriptions and pictures project.  What stood out to me most though was the precision and attentiveness of the service. If you want to be left alone to eat a meal in the corner, this is not your place. The staff here are incredibly well trained and go impressively above and beyond to be accommodating to their guests."

Redpan,4,4,Singaporean,4,4-Apr-16,"Recently the Grub which is located in Bishan Park, has opened a new outlet in Marina Square. The restaurant is located in the new wing, just above Emporium Shokuhin and behind from the main shopping stretch. Please take note of its operating hours as its kitchen is not in operation during the late afternoon till 5.30pm. During this period, only drinks and cakes are available. If you plan to dine in here during the peak dining period, please make reservation before coming. Although only 3 -4 tables were occupied when the restaurant opened for the dinner service, the staff could not accept any more walk in customers as most tables were under reservations. Such a pity which I felt.  From the booklet of menu, the prices of the dishes seem reasonable priced. However as the menu was undergoing a change, the heavy main courses from the grill were unavailable, as well as, selected items such as Seafood Chowder and Coconut Panna Cotta.  The restaurant was not big in space. It was tastefully decorated in shades of grey and red. As most tables were under reservations, we were showed to a table by the entrance, which was a bit annoying as most people who walked past inclined to take a peek at what we were eating. Since most of the tables occupied were by the entrance, it was easy to get the attention of staffs. Although iced water was served, it was not refilled, even when it was empty.  Chicken Cheese Arabiki Sausages ($8) Smoky chicken cheese arabiki sausages with sambal mayo Beware of the hot burst of cheese when you bite. The sambal mayonnaise was very good which we wiped it clean.  'Lup Cheong' Macaroni & Cheese ($12) Chinese sausage, curry leaves and cheesy bechamel tossed with macaroni This was best share with friends, because it tasted quite jelat after a few mouthfuls. It was quite oily at the bottom.  Prawn & 'Hae Bi Hiam' Pasta ($15) Tagliatelle tossed with Housemade spicy shrimp paste, Sakura ebi and saut¨¦ed prawns The flavour was great, slightly spicy and tangy with hint of seafood taste but a bit too dry.  Overall the food was not bad. The staffs seem pretty unexperienced in the way of serving and clearing the dishes."
Redpan,4,4,Singaporean,4,6-Mar-20,"Bright and lively atmosphere - not surprising since the restaurant is part of famous DP Architects group. The fusion food is innovative and good - local dishes (eg. Hainanese chicken rice, bak chor mee) served with a twist."
Redpan,4,4,Singaporean,5,5-Apr-16,"Booked via Chope, which was quite instant via the app.  Had two mains: chicken chop and duck breast. Both tasted very well but considering the price (26 and 12) and portion (meat only vs with fries and vegetables) I'd vote for the chicken.  Homemade fruit teas are nice!  although they look busy, service is still great. Well, they don't have a very large place after all but the noise is at an acceptable level."

The restaurant itself shares and indoor space with other restaurants similar to the hawkers you find all over Singapore. Our server was very friendly and helpful with our selection. He had some good recommendations.  To start, we had a crunchy shrimp salad that was incredibly flavorful and refreshing on a hot day. Next I ordered the curry crab and was a bit concerned it would be too spicy but overall it was very tasty. For someone who does not always eat spicy food it was tolerable and yet still delicious. We also had the black squid ink dish which was a very unique and delicious flavor. It had a slight lime tartness to it that was refreshing and very memorable.  Last but not least, I had the chendol dessert. It had all the components of a traditional chendol but yet also a modern twist with sago and other delicious goodies. The experience was absolutely amazing. There's also an option for prefix menu, however we just weren't up for that much food. Maybe next time I'll come prepared with a larger appetite. Overall, we loved our meal and it made our trip very special. I wouldn't expect anything less from a Michelin star restaurant in Singapore."

Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,18-Apr-24,"We decided to have some fancy meals as well during our stay in Singapore! Candlenut is the first Michelin star Peranakan restaurant in the world and we were excited to give them a try. We made a reservation for dinner and were promptly seated upon arrival. The restaurant is located far from downtown, but getting to the area was easy thanks to the great bus system.  The staff were all friendly and courteous. Our server was knowledgeable about items on the menu and made sure we were enjoying our dining experience. The ambience was very fancy and classy.  We decided to get the tasting menu, ""ah-ma-kase"", which was 13 tapas sized dishes priced at $138 SGD. This includes appetizers, main courses, and desserts. The dishes were all delicious and I had a great time sampling everything. My favorites would be the Roti Jala with Beef Kapitan Curry, Udang Nanas and Yeye's Curry with Crab.  Overall, Candlenut was a fantastic visit and we enjoyed their tasting menu of Peranakan cuisine. I definitely recommend them if you're able to splurge a little more during your visit to Singapore."

Candlenut is a Michelin 1 star Peranaken cuisine located on Dempey Rd with a bus stop right in front of the community.  Parking is plentiful and there are numerous exotic European vehicles in the parking lot.

Once inside, the restaurant appears to be connected to the other restaurants next to it with no physical barriers besides random furnishings.  A significant portion of the clientele appeared to be foreigners. Service throughout the evening was top notch with the waiter taking care to explain each and every dish. There were also very minute service details that I was surprised that the service staff were able to catch on to, including addressing me by name.  Opted for the tasting menu and it was a huge feast. The appetizers were perfect small bites although I found it odd that some of the pieces were merely lukewarm...  The soup course was tasty, although having a big bowl of hot soup in humid Singapore was a touch difficult.  For the main courses, there were ~5 entrees where the flavors were vibrant and bold. Quality of ingredients were top tier including crab, fish, and pork jowl. Portions were gigantic and I was merely able to finish less than half!  The desserts were generous as there were 3! Definitely different than typical desserts. I love that they weren't too sweet!  $172 after GST & 10% service for dinner."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,7-Jan-24,"Dined a la carte at Candlenut, the first Michelin starred Peranakan restaurant. Experience was pretty good - the ambient lighting from the straw lanterns was a nice touch. Seating was in a shared space with other restaurants - the plus side was it felt really open and inviting. Menu was definitely flavor rich - the highlights were the crab omelette and the crab curry. The omelette was fluffy and light but retained the delicate crab flavoring and the curry was loaded with fragrant spices.  Recommend you to make a reservation if dining on weekends but there were plenty of seating so walk-ins may not be an issue."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,16-Nov-23,"Oh my goodness.  Once I saw Candlenut's set menu while planning my trip, I knew I had to try it and it absolutely did not disappoint! I'm a little surprised to see how low the reviews are on Yelp but I personally thought it was worth every dollar of the ahmakase experience.  Pretty much every dish was delicious in my opinion, I only had critique for two - the salad needed more acid and the braised beef dish was a little tough. I also loved being introduced to Peranakan cuisine and Chef Malcolm certainly got his point across. Some dishes felt quite familiar actually because of the Chinese influence like the Pig Maw Soup which was milky and creamy from the pork bone broth and the Gula Melaka Fudge which reminded me of one of my favorite Chinese New Year dishes because of the heavy use of palm sugar which has a delightful caramel flavor with some vanilla undertones.  A couple dishes really stood out to me -  1. Kueh Pie Tee: a traditional Peranakan dish which featured a delicate pastry cup filled with sweet lobster amongst other fillings. It was a one biter that was a very exiting start to the journey  2. Ketam Sayur Masak Lemak: a curry filled with hunks of the SWEETEST blue swimmer crab meat! It. Was. Heavenly! It also featured their housemade sambal which really elevated the dish!  3. Cincalok Pork: the pork jowl meat is already a delicious cut that is naturally crisp, but to have it marinated in Candlenut's homemade fermented shrimp paste? WOW. Admittedly, you have to like the funkiness of shrimp paste but the end result was buttery and the pork was just so so good.  4. Pengat Pisang: the dessert was sweet yet refreshing! I also liked all the textural play in this dish. The bananas, coconut, and palm sugar all played up the tropical touch too and was perfect for Singapore.  At no point during my meal did I feel rushed even as a solo diner. Each dish was described impeccably and the staff always waited to ensure that I was ready for the next step. Even though they tell you the menu is just small dishes, after 13 of them, I certainly felt more than satisfied!  SGD $175 for the set menu, a drink, and the service charge. Candlenut is the only Michelin starred Peranakan restaurant so it was truly a unique experience!"
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,23-Dec-23,"Such a lovely experience for elevated Peranakan at Candlenut! We booked dinner here and ordered the ahmakase which is a set course menu served family style. The food here is feels homey and modern at the same time with unique touches on traditional dishes.  Some standouts included the lobster kueh pie which was an explosion of flavor, the wagyu satay beef and the crab curry. Everything was delicious and perfectly cooked and. I'd definitely recommend Candlenut to anyone visiting Singapore wanting to get a taste of Peranakan cuisine in an upscale setting. Everything from the ambiance to food to service was exceptional!"
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",4,6-Sep-23,"Superb service and a nice way to try Peranakan food. This was my first time trying cuisine so I will say I don't have too much to compare to.  I tried the ah-ma-kase, and it was a great way to sample many different things. While the waitress assured me it was not a lot of food, it was, in fact, a lot of food. Not a bad thing by any means (A great deal financially!), but I ended up taking home the desserts that wouldn't melt.  The two things I really liked here were the Beef Kapitan Curry and the Bubur Ketan Hitam (a mochi sorbet sort of dessert), but others were less memorable.  At the end of the day, I think Peranakan food is a very specific type of food that did not necessarily suit my taste buds. However, so many of my friends and coworkers rave about Candlenut and I do believe the food is great and Peranakan cuisine is both delicious and beautiful.  The waitress was super attentive, and when she noticed that I wasn't eating my food often offered to remake it with substitutes. They also offered to call me a taxi since i wasn't too sure how to get around on my first night in Singapore.  Candlenut is very accommodating and the ambiance is great (very good date vibes). Highly recommend!"
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,24-Sep-23,"A very unique and flavourful meal. First, the cuisine is based on a Singapore fusion culture and the only Michelin starred restaurant serving that food. The restaurant is located in a small development along with many other very interesting looking restaurants. We ate outside and it was quite pleasant, although warm out it was comfortable. Unlike some place where you are forgotten when dining outside, the service here was incredibly attentive and professional.  We ordered the tasting menu, which was about 15 small plates. Rather than coming one at a time, you would be served all the starters, then all the mains and finally all the desserts. Each plate was quite manageable, some were just a bite, but overall it was a lot of food, nobody would love hungry.  Most important, though, were all the interesting and unique flavours. All of the dishes were quite complex and none were disappointing. I particularly liked the seafood dishes, a white curry with crab was the most memorable. Also a nice wine list, I particularly enjoyed the Lebanese red. Definitely a great experience."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,29-Jul-23,"If I could give Candlenut 10 stars, I would! Two words come to mind for me: Heritage and Innovation. Candlenut is a place that both honors the heritage, respects the ingredients, while continuing to innovate.  On my recent June/July trip to Southeast Asia, I had the pleasure of dining with Candlenut at the beginning of the trip on my own for lunch, and returning the night before we left with a party of 9 for dinner in one of their private rooms.  | Space & Area | The space is beautiful and delightful! With a high ceiling, tall windows, and glass doors, when I dined in for lunch, the space was flooded with comfortable natural lighting. In the evening, the space turns into an elegant dining hall with beautiful ambient lighting overhead.  Neighboring Candlenut is another bar/lounge, all in the same contiguous open space, and it works. Dempsey Hill, the area where Candlenut is situated, was originally the site of a nutmeg plantation that later became Tanglin Barracks for British troops. because of its historical value, certain modifications are not allowed to preserve the building. Pretty neat stuff!  | Food | I love Peranankan cuisine and Candlenut delivered above and beyond. I was so glad to dine here on my first day arriving into Singapore. The traditional dishes are made with a modern twist. Everything was delicious!  Standouts for me included the lobster kueh pie tee (it's possible I like lobster everything! ), waygu beef satay, chicken curry, crab curry (no shells!!), cendol, and durian coconut crepe roll. The butterfly pea tea was very memorable, and so comforting also after all the food.  I also appreciated both being able to dine there solo, still able to experience many dishes via their ah-ma-kase set menu (available for both lunch and dinner, a bountiful meal!), as well as being able to order ala carte for my 2nd meal in the private room. I appreciated this flexibility and some of the dishes on the ah-ma-kase were available for order for the group as well. Loved it!  | Service | The service from the staff here was outstanding!  At ~36k ft above ground on my flight from US to Singapore, I got multiple phone calls from a Singapore phone #. Who was calling me? I'm so used to arriving the next day when traveling from the US to Asia that I made my solo reservation for while I was in the air; I forgot that I flew out in the late evening! Thankfully, the folks at Candlenut were kind enough to let me apply the no-show penalty to my lunch the next day, on the actual day I arrived. I was very glad they were able to accommodate me for the reservation.  While there for my first meal, dining solo, I had the fortune to meet Felix, who took care of me throughout the meal. He was friendly, kind, and so knowledgeable; I especially appreciated his passion for the food here, and how kind he was to me. It was an unforgettable experience!  I was very glad Candlenut was able to squeeze us in for our last dinner before returning to the US. Another gentleman had taken care of us and his guidance on what to order was spot on.  Overall, service was friendly, attentive but not overwhelming. Part of Candlenut's success is surely attributed to this outstanding staff. I might even go as far to say that this is the best service I've received anywhere, even when compared to the many three Michelin star restaurants we've dined at. I'm a little in love with Candlenut."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",4,29-Jun-23,"We came here for a friend's dinner - a note that big group sizes are often required to a minimum spend. In our case, this was $150 per person... we spent exactly that with food and wine included!  Candlenut has been on my list for a while, for one-star Michelin peranakan food. It was good and the Dempsey vibe is chill, but overall I personally found the dishes quite salty.  We ordered a ton of dishes to share, and the waiters were friendly and attentive through the full meal. One friend who's been here did the ordering - and she didn't disappoint!  To start off, we got the pork satay (didn't particularly stand out imo), a wing bean salad (decently flavoured but super small portion), and a sausage-like pork in crispy bean curd skin.  For mains, we shared a ton of food. Standouts for me were the blue swimmer crab curry (legit had CHUNKS of crab in the creamy coconut curry), the wagyu beef rib rendang (so fatty, the meat literally melted in my mouth), buah keluak fried rice with crispy fried egg (tasted almost Thai-inspired to me, with some nice nuttiness from the grains), and wok fried tiger prawns (so juicy and plump! lots of bite). There was also one wok fried vegetable (the sambal four heavenly kings) that I liked; it had quite a kick to it! Given the inordinate amount of curry and sauces, we definitely had ample rice to sop it all up.  The middle tier dishes, for me, were the chicken curry (good but nothing special), the snapper fillet (was such a mild tasting protein that it was frankly overshadowed by the others), and an eggplant & lady finger / okra curry (nothing special).  In terms of dishes I was not impressed by, that would have to be the squid. I found the squid a bit limp and lacking in flavour...  We shared two bottles of white across the table (I had only a few sips) and then also cut open two cakes we brought from outside (cake cutting fee is $20 per cake).  Overall, I found Candlenut quite good for peranakan food - ambience was decent and nothing too fancy, a good mix of laid back and dress-up (can swing either way). Given the price point - and that I'm a broke student - I'm unlikely to come by again in the next little while, but a good item to have on your list!"
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,11-Apr-24,"Stunning, excellent, scrumptious. Food was excellent. Service was good as well. Interior decorations were cute. Amazingly priced for the quality."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",4,12-May-23,"Came on the recommendation from a local friend to enjoy a tasting menu of local cuisine. The setting is a bit unique as it's in a strip of restaurants, some of which appear connected. The decor is relaxed southeast Asian with simple tables and chairs comfortably distanced from each other. Service was fantastic with the detailed description of dishes and pacing of the meal.  The food itself was good, with a strong start that petered out as we progressed through. The starters were all tasty bites of different flavors allowing you to have a nice mix in one bite. While it's a tasting menu, it is served in phases with multiple at the same time. There were 3-4 starters presented for the table as easy finger food. The next course - the mains - were also shared family style simultaneously for the table. The mains were all good, but lacked any true standouts which which would have us wanting more. Dessert didn't really tickle our fancy, but looked unique with its blue pea flower coloring.  We found the drinks menu underwhelming - a few gin and tonic options for cocktails but otherwise none. Wine list was decent.  Would potentially go back and try dishes ordered individually."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,26-Feb-23,"Great service. Staff was very accommodating. Our meal was as follows: Appetizers Ngoh Hiang - Minced free range pork, prawns, shiitake mushroom, water chestnut wrapped in beancurd skin  Snake River Farm Kurobuta Pork Neck Satay - Glazed with kicap manis, grilled and smoked over charcoal  Mains Udang Sambal Petai Wok tossed Ang Kar prawns with ikan bilis sambal, petai beans and chillis  Westholme Wagyu Beef Rib Rendang Dry caramelised coconut curry with spices and turmeric leaf garnished with serunding  Blue Swimmer Crab Curry A Candlenut signature, turmeric, galangal, coconut milk, kaffir lime leaf  Desserts  Candlenut's Chendol young coconut shaved ice, homemade pandan jelly, sago pearl, silky coconut custard and gula melaka  Kueh Salat a perfectly smooth custard made with naturally extracted pandan and coconut milk steamed with fragrant glutinous rice cake coloured with fresh blue pea flower, served with young coconut sorbet  Everything was great. Only thing I would do differently next time is to get the Chef's Mum's Chicken Curry ( description- My mum's signature, a must have at every family special occasion, To The San Chicken cooked with potato, kaffir lime leaf) rather than the Wagyu beef rib rendang. I am a big fan of Wagyu and it is served better very plain or with only a little bit of seasoning. Should have known better. The preparation was good, just not my preference.  They gave us a parting gift of short bread cookies topped with floral merengue and almond cookies which went great with the Candlenut's Bespoke Blue Pea Flower Tea.  My family and I had a wonderful dining experience."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",3,27-Sep-23,"Had very high hope given the Michelin star and so many recommended on social media. Started off strong - our server was very welcoming and knowledgeable of the cuisine/history of the restaurant. We had a big lunch around 2:30pm so we weren't very hungry for dinner and decided to go with a la carte vs omakase. Ordered the fried bean curd roll appetizer, fried rice, curry crab and Sambal vegetables. Overall a bit too sweet for my liking but appreciated the unique character of the dishes. However the service went downhill from here. My water glass wasn't filled for 10+ minutes until I flagged someone down. Then we waited around for another 10+ mins for our table to be cleaned and served dessert menu. Our server never stopped by once since our dishes arrived, no check-ins, no refills until the very end, she came by with the check and asked us if we wanted to join the membership... obviously no lol. Mind you this is on a Wednesday night so the place was about only half full. Would recommend you try somewhere else if wanting a better service and dining experience."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,25-Feb-23,"100% recommend this restaurant. Totally worth the 1 start Michelin. We tried the tasting menu for February and everything is tasty and mastered. And they are super complimentary with my food allergies. For ke, my favorite is Kay Bacok (marinated chicken in coconut milk) and sambal telor (egg & squid in cuttlefish sambal). Also loveee the dessert. Before visiting Singapore, I had no clue as to who Peranakans are. But Candlenut helps me get to know them through their food. I would recommend anyone who wants to know about Peranakans to come here after the Peranakan Museum!"
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,9-May-23,My husband had been raving about Candlenut since his last trip to Singapore (prior to Covid) so my expectations were high. Candlenut did not disappoint. Our waiter Felix expertly guided us through this gastronomic wonderland. We ordered the tasting menu which the chef gladly catered to my dietary limitations (I'm pescatarian) while allowing my husband to go full carnivore. Each dish was perfectly balanced with intricate flavors that I could never hope to replicate at home. Each dish was unique and as exceptional as the last. We could not have been happier.
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",4,1-Jul-23,One Michelin star Peranakan food. Everything was quite tasty and prices were reasonable for a Michelin star restaurant. Definitely worth trying.
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,23-May-23,"Before coming to Singapore, I had written to the restaurant to ask if it would be possible to do a pescatarian tasting menu. The way that was done was so generous and welcoming. I didn't feel like I was ""missing"" anything, and in fact got one dish that wasn't even really on the menu, prepared so I could have all of the tasting courses. The food was INCREDIBLE - so flavorful and interesting. I learned about this restaurant on the show ""Somebody Feed Phil"" and was fascinated by the idea of highly crafted, fine dining Peranakan cuisine. I am so grateful I was able to experience this cuisine and culture in such a beautiful environment. I will never come to Singapore without making reservations here, and will tell anyone I know that they have to come!"
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,13-Mar-24,"Everything about Candlenut was outstanding. 5 stars isn't enough. The entire staff was exceptional. My sister and I had the extraordinary Felix take care of us, who went above and beyond his service of us! Hats off to Chef -- amazing food! Our experience at Candlenut was phenomenal. Thank you!"
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,23-Feb-23,"Had an incredible time here. Rose bottle of the month was the best sparkling rose I've ever had. Did the tasting menu. Was incredible. We thought about a two michellin place but I was so happy coming here instead because you can tell the food has love and comfort mind and tastes behind it, with an elevated style. Definitely my favorite restaurant in Singapore that I tried. Can't wait to come back."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,7-Oct-23,"The food is an excellent intepretation of Singapore fusion. Quality ingredients and an exciting and innovative experience. The waiting staff were excellent, explaining each dish with enthusiasm and great understanding. The venue is delightful and a great wine list. Very enjoyable evening."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,31-Jul-23,"We had a great experience with Candlenut starting at the booking. The restaurant was very quick and helpful communicating with us regarding 1 of us being vegetarian. We went as part of our honeymoon and the food and service were excellent. We loved our waiter too, wish we had his name!"
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",3,16-Jul-23,This place was expensive. Presentation was good. Portions were small. Taste of dishes were not that distinctive. Service was good. Ambiance was so so.
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,11-Apr-22,Wow!! Michelin 1 star?? Should be at least 2!!! We have been to many so call Baba eatery none interpreted the essence of Nonya cooking with a modern twist as much as here. Top with with an unpretentious service to me this what a Michelin worthy restaurant should be. Definitely will be back with a bigger bunch!!!
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,4-Aug-23,"Candlenut is absolutely extraordinary. It was a very unique place. The food was phenomenal. Each dish was expertly prepared, appealingly presented and simply delicious. The atmosphere was delightful and the staff was pleasant and courteous. Exceptional meal and impeccable service - definitely a must return."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,3-May-19,"After visiting the Peranakan Museum in Singapore, my friend and I decided to give this place a try as our *fancier* michelin-starred meal of the trip. (Of course, it's so easy to find $2 michelin starred meals in Singapore.)  First off, this place was beautiful. It was located in a complex of a few restaurants and bars in a very nice area. The servers were super attentive and helpful in recommendations.  We ended up ordering a few dishes. If I remember correctly:  ~Candlenut Buah Keluak Fried Rice- actually super spicy (for me lol) but was one of my favorite side dishes. ~Wok fried Tiger Prawns- Prawns were made well and in a tasty curry sauce ~Wagyu Beef Rendang- also one of my favorites of the night.. such tender beef!! ~Satay- covered in a sweet savory sauce, also recommended!  Also if you want an drink that makes you feel like a total child: Milo dinosaur. It's like an advanced version of chocolate milk drink with grass jelly... only for the adventurous."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",3,13-Feb-19,"Candlenut is in a beautiful location in Como Dempsey. I'd heard many things about the restaurant and was curious to try it myself. My table ordered the ah-ma-kase which is a super cute local take on the tasting menus of fancy restaurants. Out came a flurry of dishes, all tiny and exquisite.  When it comes to Peranakan food, I'm used to sizable portions and strong flavors. Here it's a little more refined and didn't give me that satisfaction of endless amounts of food despite being satisfying overall. Shoutouts to the fish cracker starter that was airy and crunchy and delicious, the lamb satay which was mind blowingly tender and flavorful, the wing bean salad that was refreshing and crunchy, and the blue swimmer crab curry which was lemak and really good. I also liked my durian dessert though I guess if you have good durian you don't need to mess with it too much.  For the price I paid, I wanted more food. It was all nice but I'm a stickler for tradition and would probably go back to my old haunts for some good old Peranakan eats. This is somewhere I'd bring guests or have a fancy meal!"
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,1-Dec-22,"Had heard rave reviews about this Michelin rated restaurant and was eager to check it out. Everything we ordered was well seasoned ( not overly salty) with well balanced flavors, well presented and tasty. My guests especially enjoyed the durian dessert and wanted to find out the supplier of the MSW durian! However, our server informed us that the chef in charge of desserts was not there yesterday. I would appreciate it if the restaurant is able to share their supplier's info, but if not, I understand. One guest enjoyed the ASSAM SOTONG & BK RICE the most, the other guest liked the ASSAM SOTONG & SAMBAL FOUR HEAVENLY KINGS the most and both of them agreed that they were impressed with the CHAP CHYE flavors, too. They also highly recommended the durian dessert. My favorites were the NGOH HIANG, WING BEAN SALAD & FOUR HK. I did also enjoy the BK fried rice which had a rich full flavor (I thought it better than Indo Cafe's!). Sadly to me, the BK ice cream, sounded better than it tasted ( too sweet for my taste- from the caramel), and the KUEH PIE TEE was disappointing as the flavors were more western, nothing to sing about- a definite miss- perhaps reconsider an Asian flavor instead as it did not even spark any PERANAKAN flavor or influence. Outstanding service from all staff- attentive, courteous, engaging, informative, happy to assist us & answer any questions- we felt well taken care of. We definitely appreciated our server's complimentary Bespoke Candlenut tea to enjoy with our desserts. Lovely ambience with the decor, assorted tables and spacing; though the air-conditioning did not seem powerful enough for the high ceiling space. The air seemed to reached the overhead lampshades ( causing them to swirl) thus blocking the airflow to diners. All in all a wonderful dining experience that will bring us back again ( and recommend this restaurant to others.) Kudos to Chef ML & his whole team!"
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",3,24-Feb-19,"This place specializes in Peranakan food (a blend of Chinese and Malay), and this was my first Peranakan experience.  We ordered the tasting menu and you can see a lot of effort is put in the presentation and I enjoyed the food. Maybe it's something I have to get used to, but what this was IMO was very traditional dishes that you usually think of as homey and comfortable, and they just swapped the ingredients to premium quality. There's just some mental block of homey comfort food should be cheap, simple, and delicious and in this case the comfort food was expensive, simple, and delicious. Sure it tasted better, but I'm not sure if it was worth the extra price tag. If price is no concern, this is a very enjoyable place. If it is, I'm not sold that it's entirely worth it.  Some of my favorite items from the tasting menu were the lamb neck satay, deep fried octopus, blue swimmer crab curry (their speciality), baby squid in tamarind sauce.  The lamb was really soft and felt fatty, but I don't think it was. The deep fried octopus had a bunch of seasoning with it and was just a really unique dish. The crab curry was kind of exactly how you would imagine it. Curry and crab (the crab was of such high quality though and it really stood out). The baby squid was masked with this really interesting sauce. It was spicy, very acidic, and sweet.  All in all, it ended up being S$210"
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",3,26-Jul-18,"Came here to try Michelin Star fine dining restaurant. It was featured in the AAA magazine. They are known to use local ingredients featuring Peranakan cuisine. Service is relatively attentive. There was a minor incident that annoyed me. We ordered the prix fix and an a la carte dish, the waiter decided to not put down my request believing we may not finish the food. (I think it is is lame excuse that he forgot) The tasting menu is as follows Starts off with shrimp chips with spicy dipping sauce. Kieu pee tee with Bermuda tartare- great beginning love the crispy shell and the tangy filling  Maori lamb skewer- well marinated lamb that cuts the game and gain the flavor  Dumpling seafood bisque-full bodied seafood soup ( not really a bisque) with dumpling ( not very good dumpling the skin tasted doughy)  The next course is family style of various dishes with white rice: Star fruit salad- refreshing palate cleanser between eating the heavy sides with there were more! Squid curry An xin chicken Cod fish tau cheo * Beef randan * Sambal telur And braised pork  The stated dishes were my favorite they paired well with the Starfruit salad. Very developed flavors of umami and spices  The desserts was my favorites Coconut shaved ice was a real cleanser from the heavy sauces dishes. It really calmed you after a storm  The nyonya Kueh selections were a delight paired with blue sweet pea blossom tea.  I gave it 3.5 stars because of not getting the a la carte dish when it was our conscious decision. And not all the sauces dishes were to our palate. Kinda on the heavy flavor side. I hade to get two bowls of rice to eat the sauces dishes.  The ambience is clean and comfortable. Very fusion tropical. I do recommend this place for a date if you are in Singapore"
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,3-Oct-18,"This is the first time that I have had Perankan food and I really enjoyed my meal at Candlenut. The food is really delicious and the flavors were complex and unique. I enjoyed all the dishes that I ordered. My rating is based on the following:  Food: 5 stars Environment: 4 stars Service: 4.5 stars Recommendations: Wagyu beef rendang  The portion size is on the small side. I knew this before hand after reading some of the reviews and ordered two mains. I came in hungry and easily finished a bowl of rice, the king tiger prawns, the beef rendang, and the buah keluak ice cream.  1 The wagyu beef rendang - This is the best beef rendang I have ever had. The meat was cut with a fork tender and was bursting with flavor. I highly recommend.  2King tiger prawns - The coconut sauce the prawns were served with was delicious. The prawns were cooked nicely and the shell was partially removed making it easy to eat. This dish only comes with two prawns though and feels more like a small plate than a main.  3 Buah keluak ice cream - The dish looks simple in appearance but there is a lot going in here. You have a mix of temperatures (warm chocolate vs ice cream), textures (cake crumbs vs ice cream and melted chocolate) , and tastes (sweet and spice).  I would like to come back again and try the tasting menu. I didn't get to try any of small plates, soups or roasted dishes. You should definitely check this place out. It's not cheap but it's worth it."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,16-Jan-23,"We started with the Ngor hiong... crispy pieces of pork rolls fried to perfection, and the wing bean salad was delectably fresh tasting, then the crab curry which had a rich but not overpowering curry taste and the grilled fish, which was covered with tasty sambal, very rich dishes that go perfectly with white rice! Ended with the musang king durian crepe roll, fresh durian taste... perfectly sweet for a durian lover... highly recommend this restaurant for anyone passing through Singapore! Tasty and wonderful representation of local staples!"
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",2,3-Dec-19,"I was quite excited about trying this place during my visit to Singapore, but it fell flat for me.  I opted for the tasting menu, and some of the dishes were very good. I particularly enjoyed the appetizers and the wing bean salad, as well as the kueh salat. However, I was disappointed with all other main course dishes. The tiger prawns, which I had looked forward to, were depressingly overcooked. I know that shrimp can be challenging not to overcook, but I expect a Michelin star restaurant to have this technique down.  I shared with two members of the waitstaff about the overcooked shrimp and nothing was done to make up for this basic technique messup. Nothing was sent from the kitchen and nothing was removed from the bill. I didn't want to make a scene so I just paid (and left a 16% tip on top of the 10% service fee thinking I wasn't being generous only to find out that I probably should not have left any additional tip), but I am still somewhat in awe that a restaurant of such high recognition failed to do some of the most basic service industry things. Maybe I am spoiled from my previous Michelin experiences, but it just simply did not measure up to other 1 star places I've dined at.  One thing I do recommend is the tea that I ordered that was called the Candlenut on the menu. I kind of wish I had asked if I could purchase this tea to bring back with me.  Overall disappointing, because I really want to see more Asian chefs receive recognition for providing great dining experiences around the world, but Candlenut does not receive a recommendation from me."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,24-Mar-17,"""Something taste like lemon Dawn"" I whisper.  ""Right?"" Whispers my dining companion through giggles.  And that began what unbeknownst to me would be one of the best meals in Singapore.  It just goes to show that you should not start off exploring a country's food with the most difficult to understand, and highly refined.  Candlenut is a Michelin one star Peranaken restaurant in the heart of Dempsey. The food is uniquely Singaporean, the joining of Chinese and Malay food using the local ingredients.  The dining space, part of a large warehouse, does not at all resemble a Michelin restaurant however, the food speaks for itself.  Begin with a number of small plates. All dishes are meant to be shared. The kueh pie tee crispy shell stuffed with crab meat, seasoned with curry, and a bit of pickled shallots, almost taste of laksa. The wing bean salad with baby radish, lemongrass, cashews in a calimansi lime dressing, the definition of texture. Extremely refreshing. Finally the crispy pork belly with pickled greens, outstanding. Think of the best Filipino lechon topped with crisp pickled veg, it's tight sour grip finishing with a gentle fermented seafood flavor. Excellent complexity.  Mains crisscross the country. An excellent wagyu beef rendang, tender and extremely flavorful wrapped in a slury of cumin, turmeric, turmeric leaves, and other spices, wallops the pallet. The spice mix penetrates the meat all the way to its deep core. Not to be out done, a dish called ""Mum's Curry"" is equally deeply flavored. Tender, juicy chunks of chicken and potatoes and a deep rich curry mixture. Fresh peppers brighten the dish. Both are perfect spooned over some rice.  The dish of the evening, red lion snapper simply cooked in a fresh chili sambal with charred garlic chives; incredible. The sweet flavor of the fish is accented beautifully by the fiery sambal. A squeeze of calamansi brightens the flavor.  Desserts, are also outstanding. It is hard to fault the Kueh salat with bangkit crumble and young coconut sorbet. Hawaii yeeps, think of the best custard mochi you've ever had, add a light, refreshing, coconut supercharged sorbet and you have this dish.  Service is informal and very friendly. As with most South East Asian countries, you must flag the server if you want something.  Nice selection of wine however there is no better match to the food than beer considering the spice levels.  Reservations required.  Impressive to say the least. Save this for your final meal in the country and it will all make sense.  Thank you Singapore."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",3,12-Jan-20,"This is more of a 3.5!  I came here with the boy towards the end of our time in Singapore. We had been in Southeast Asia for the past 2 weeks of our 7 week trip, specifically in Indonesia. One of my friends highly recommended it so I made reservations a month beforehand.  Don't get me wrong, the place is nice. I didn't realize it would share a space with another restaurant (like there isn't a separating wall). But as I said earlier, we had spent the past couple of weeks in Asia (and this wasn't our first time in Singapore) so we were a little disappointed just because it didn't taste ""new"" to us. We had been to other places that had better rendang or curry. If we had come here at the beginning of our trip, we probably would have been impressed.  We liked the start of the meal with the soup and appetizers but the family style mains were a meh. I wish we had more time to explore the area and nearby restaurants since it seemed to be a pretty classy place."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,20-Jan-20,"Candlenut is about 15 minutes by taxi coming from the Bay area. I wanted to try this place as I never had Peranakan cuisine before and this place had good reviews and a micheline star.  We went for the tasting menu aka. ahmakase menu (Candlenut's version of omakase). The restaurant is not located in a mall which is good as it offers something different then the mall based scenery of Orchard Street. Though it is in a restaurant complex with a few other restaurants around, that does not affect the overall experience. I had read some comments about the seating being too stuffy but that was not my experience.  The food was very good. I do not remember all the names of the foods we've tried but none of them disappointed. With each meal our hostess explained what we were eating. The desserts were amazing, service was great and all in all this was a really good dining experience. The service time is 2 hours but we went there at the last service so that wasn't an issue for us. I would recommend trying!"
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,29-Oct-18,"I've tried True Blue and Blue Ginger - and Candlenut stands above both (in quality and cost!)  The starters - Pork Neck Satay and DIY Kueh Pie Tee shells were succulent and delicious. The Beef Rendang was incredibly flavoursome. The Buah Keluak chicken came apart tenderly. The Buah Keluak fried rice was also incredible.  For deserts, the Buah Keluak ice cream was also really unique delicious. The other deserts were so-so. This was a fantastic meal, and the best Peranakan food I've had yet in Singapore."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,14-Jan-18,"A chance encounter with the documentary ""Food Heros"" featuring Peranakan chef Malcolm Lee got me interested in his restaurant, Candlenut in Singapore. Here I was, a week later... and what a culinary adventure!  This is not your traditional Peranakan restaurant. Candlenut features many familiar ingredients that the Straits Chinese use, but it has creatively tweaked some recipes and on occasion created something new, the Buah Keluak ice cream for one. Having a non-discriminatory palate (and an open mind) is really the best way to make the most of your experience here.  We went for the cheekily named 'ah-ma-kase' set menu which came with three appetisers, soup, salad and a selection of main courses.  For appetisers, we had the Smoked Octopus Acar (spicy pickle), Kurobuta Pork Satay (tender, perfectly grilled, hints of paprika, accompanied by a sweet sauce), and the exceptionally delectable Kueh Pie Tee (wafer thin crispy shells filled with tasty crabmeat, subtle hints of lemongrass).  Appetisers were quickly followed by Itek Tim, a savoury-sourish duck soup. Candlenut offered an interesting twist, adding spongelike taro stem to the soup and having the duck meat served as a meatball with minced mushrooms and pickled mustard cabbage.  The main courses which came in generous portions, were served communal style. Mom's Curry Prawns was my favorite - giant prawns were first lightly grilled then cooked in a delicious lemongrass candlenut curry gravy. Grilled Red Snapper (drizzled with lime juice, lemongrass-onion-chilli sauce) was another outstanding dish. Duck Curry, aromatic from various ground spices, was cooked in a rendang style with the coconut curry thick and creamy. Wok-fried Pork Slices was another winner. Saut¨¦ed with prawn chilli sambal and shredded kaffir lime leaves, it delivered a remarkably fiery punch, punctuated by the distinctive citrusy notes of the lime leaves. Prawn Wing Bean Salad offered a refreshing light contrast to the other main dishes but as this was nearly the only greens in the set, I would have loved for it to come in a bigger serving.  After a complimentary palate cleanser - lemongrass granita, we moved on to desserts. The Mao Shan Wang Durian Ice Cream was every bit as mouthwatering as its pedigree would have you anticipate. It was also a pretty scoop adorned with flowers and a rose cookie. Steamed Banana Cake was light and fluffy, pairing beautifully with the accompanying Gula Melaka ice cream. However the star in this section belonged to the Buah Keluak Ice Cream. Savoury bits of the distinctive earthly nut were mixed into the ice cream and there was also the delightful crunch of salted caramel. What a brilliant combination of flavours and textures.  Traditional Peranakan cuisine will always be a part of Singapore's food culture. Notwithstanding, I applaud Candlenut's creative flair, and courage in pushing boundaries, and for its ambition to elevate Peranakan cuisine to levels of fine dining. Afterall didn't Peranakan cuisine evolve from an innovative fusion of cooking techniques and ingredients of 2 or more distinct cultures, necessitated in part by a need to adapt? Kudos, Chef Lee and his team."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",4,9-Feb-20,"I was interested in trying a more locally focused tasting menu, so we came to Candlenut for their ""ah-ma-kase."" I booked it online about 1 month out when reservations opened, but it wasn't as full as I expected on a Saturday night.  It's located on a hill in the Como Dempsey restaurant complex - pretty much only accessible by car (we used Grab). The complex itself is very pretty, and the restaurant shares its space with another one for their places.  The atmosphere is fairly casual - no real dress code.  Complimentary: - Fish crackers and sweet soy sauce  To start: - Kueh pie tee shell, Boston lobster, yeye curry, roasted candlenut: crisp thin pastry shell with lobster and galangal - Deep fried Fremantle octopus, pineapple and cucumber achar, roasted peanuts: the relish on top was nice - Bergedil, sambal ikan bilis: deep fried potato hash with anchovy sambal - Charcoal grilled snake river farm kurobota pork satay, kicap manis glaze: good sweet pork satay  Soup: - Hee peow soup, fa gao, eel fish maw, chicken stuffed tofu puff, fried shallot, minced crab, fish broth - the broth was rich. I'm not a huge fan of fish maw, but it was an interesting soup  Mains: a lot of small dishes served family style (slightly reminiscent of an Indonesian rice table).. - Westholme wagyu beef rib rendang, serunding, turmeric leaf: tons for flavor, great with rice. Even better with some kaffir lime - Babi buah keluak soft bone pork with black nut gravy: because of the cut of pork, some parts were quite fatty, some parts were more cartilage, but overall, flavor was good - Blue swimmer crab curry, turmeric, galangal, kaffir lime leaf: this was the star - tons of lump crab meat in a coconut curry, even better with a squeeze of lime - Crispy turmeric Tiger beer battered soft shell prawn: never had soft shell prawn before. It was quite big, served head on; eat while hot - Ikan chuan chuan, kuhlbarra ocean barramundi filet, fermented soybean, ginger sauce, fried ginger - Tauhu goreng, sayur manis and young jackfruit, peanut sauce, ginger flower: like tofu with peanut sauce (reminded me of Thai food)  Additional dipping sauces: - Red chili sambal with crispy chicken skin: good with the beef and the curry - Tempeh, sambal hijau: good with rice  Pre dessert: - Sweet mandarin orange tangerine shaved ice with red dragon fruit granita and mint - very refreshing.  Dessert: - Buah keluak ice cream with valrhona chocolate, salted caramel, chili, warm milk chocolate sauce. The dessert had pop rocks in it. Flavor was good - interesting time read about the dying art of cultivating the buah keluak. - Nyonya kueh: traditional square of a small rice cake - Bunga telang tea: good with the rice cake  I was stuffed - it was a good amount of food but the best way to try everything. Based off our favorites from the tasting, from the a la carte menu, I would say get the crab curry, beef rendang, and the pork satay.  The tasting was 128 SGD per person plus tax/service fee. Overall, it was definitely a more unique dining experience than your usual European tasting menu, which I really appreciate. I think it's worth checking out for a good tasting of Perenakan cuisine."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",3,22-Apr-18,"Dining here was not the experience that I expected. The only good thing was the service which was impeccable, but one cannot eat the service. It can only go thus far. The ambiance was disappointing and the decor was dated. The food was doubly disappointing as well. The blue crab dish was good but other elements left a lot to desire. The dessert was the worst. It reminded me of a mixture of frozen artificial fruit juice, jello, ice chips and fake honey. Ambiance: 5/10 Noise level: 6/10, 1 being the noisiest. Flavor: 6/10 Taste: 5/10 Return factor: 1/10 Recommend: 4/10."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",3,19-Aug-17,"When I heard we were going to Candlenut for lunch, I was excited since I'm a fan of peranakan food and I've heard good stuff about it too. Ambience is nice... the place is done up really nicely decor-wise and it felt quite sophisticated yet traditional.  There were 6 of us so we ordered a good variety of dishes to share. My favorite dish was the charcoal grilled whole squid with fresh yellow tumeric sambal - really tender and fragrant, and was complemented well with the sambal, which was very flavorful. I'd also recommend the babi pongteh (braised duroc pork cheek pongteh) which was super tender. The ayam buah keluak was tasty too though I wish they left the whole nut inside for the experience...  The one thing I wished though was if the server had asked us if we wanted to have a portion of the homemade sambal belachan to try - $2 per sharing portion. I mean... yes it's on the menu, and I don't agree with having to pay for it, but the point is that they didn't even ask... and I found the food not spicy enough.. it's a peranakan restaurant after all right?  Dessert was expensive and absolutely nothing to shout about. I'd give it a miss if I find myself back there.  Overall, not too bad ""refined"" peranakan food but I think you can find better elsewhere for cheaper and with more character."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",4,1-Apr-17,"Candlenut @ Dempsey  Gone upmarket  Ambience much nicer than before.  In premises shared with a Japanese restaurant, a mini Market, a bar in the centre of the premises and at the other end a French restaurant.  The waitresses are no longer in kebayas. Why? Because it doesn't fit the new image.  Saw the Chef walking around in a suit!  Satay didn't have much of a satay sauce. It was just grilled meat. This was much better previously. They shouldn't have changed it!  Crispy bean curd skin ngor hiang (minced pork, prawns & water chestnut) - not fragrant. The one at Singapura Seafood Restaurant is better.  Wild caught baby squid, sambal belachan cherry tomatoes & red onions texture of squid was tender, sauce was good, cherry tomatoes good too. Overall it is tasty but a tad saltish.  Tiger prawns, petai beans, tamarind & shallots - prawns don't quite look the size of tiger prawns.   Candlenut's classic chendol cream, Pandan jelly & Gula Melaka - Super sweet.  Food was very good before. Tonight it was only average.  I would say it's okay tonight but unfortunately not worthy of its Michelin Star."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",2,16-Jun-17,"It was my first trip to Singapore, and I was beyond excited to visit the haven of street food and Michelin Stars. I was glad to have found just one Michelin restaurant with Singaporean roots.  I honestly must say, I was disappointed. Singaporean food, boasting strong flavors and rich spices, was not accurately reflected in the meal I had.  The jackfruit curry was mild in flavor, without the strong spice flavors.  The sambal was very tender, but the meat was quite shredded and the flavor, again, not as strong as the rich street foods we had tried.  Singaporean food all should have strong enough flavors that require it to be paired with rice, but my rice bowl was still near full.   Some advice for visitors: although Singapore may have the most number of Michelin Starred restaurants, if you want a local Singaporean experience, stick with the food markets and the local restaurants to truly get the Singaporean eating experience."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",1,25-Feb-20,"The waitress set down a beautiful platter of appetizer bites, one of which sported a piece of gold leaf on top. What sophistication! My date and I were in awe and couldn't wait to dig in.  And then we tasted the food.  Candlenut is without a doubt the most disappointing restaurant we've ever eaten at.  It's bland. Not ""refined"" -- just bland. The batter was undersalted. The soup had no body. The curries had no bite. This isn't Peranakan food, and calling it ""ahma's"" cooking is an insult to the legions of nonya grandmothers who put together better meals every night.  Candlenut couldn't even nail the basics. The fried tofu was not crispy. The soft shelled shrimp was undersalted and tasted like fishy water when you bit into it. And somehow, nearly everything that should have been served hot hit our table at an unappetizing room temperature. We couldn't stomach most of the food.  If I hadn't eaten at other restaurants that _were_ deserving of their Michelin stars, I'd never set foot in a guide-recommended establishment again. Not only is Candlenut a poor example of Peranakan food, it's not a well executed meal, period.  I paid full price for this awful meal ($350 sgd). If you work hard for your money and like good food, heed the many warnings on Yelp, and spend it elsewhere."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",4,8-Dec-17,"As long as you don't come here with really high expectations it was a good meal. The place was empty on a weds night and started filling up after 8. Keep in mind they don't seem to have a bar and serve mostly wines and beers.  We got the omakase, the most memorable dish was the beef rendang. I'd come here for a chill dinner if your willing to pay for it."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,3-Jun-19,"Whenever I am brought down by the stresses of life, Candlenut is one of a few places that can definitely bring me up. The homey ambiance, mind-blowing food and friendly staff are Candlenut's trifecta to my tummy - and my heart.  The Blue Swimmer Crab Curry, Beef Rendang, and Kurobuta Pork Neck Satay are definite staples. Apart from those, Chef Malcolm keeps things interesting with the restaurant's constantly changing menu. This makes Candlenut worth a lifetime of visits.  This place is mindblowingly good. I give it - twelve spoons out of ten."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",4,13-Oct-18,"4.5 stars. 1 Michelin star Modern Peranakan cuisine. I like the food here - although not all dishes are to my personal liking - everything was delicate, sophisticated and memorable. The portions here are quite small so would recommend ordering 3-5 dishes for 2 people. Details of what we ordered below: - Kueh Pie Tee Shell - a classic traditional Singaporean appetizer. Executed well - Crab Curry - tastes like Thai food to me but nonetheless a terrific dish - very flavorful - the citrus taste is quite strong, which helps balance out the rich which can be quite rich - Buah Keluak fried rice - a bit bitter though I guess that's how it's supposed to be. Good dish though - Braised Chicken with Peranakan Black Nut Sambal - stewed chicken in black curry - very unique flavors - chicken is tender and the curry has a character - A bit expensive - but well worth it.  Good service as expected from a restaurant in this price range."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",2,24-Jan-17,"With expectations set high on the worlds first Michelin starred Paranakan cuisine restaurant, I must admit that I was quite unfortunately, disappointed. From the inattentive waiters and waitresses to the seeming slight imbalance in flavours (with perhaps an overly abundant overload on the quite heavily salted buah keluak) and lack of the expected extra ""finer details"" characteristic of highly praised restaurants in similar food eschelons, the experience was quite disappointing all around.  I will say, however, that granted, the flavours, portions, and service could be improved the dishes are quite photogenic."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,20-Dec-18,"Celebrated a special occasion here while in Singapore on a short 2 day visit. The head chef himself came out and discussed in detail when each course was served. Wine selection although limited was very well paired with the food. Tasted quite unique and delicious! Portions were a tad small, maybe I'm being unfair saying this comparing it with US portion sizes. The thing that stood out most was service, and people around us seemed to be enjoying themselves too"
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",4,25-Nov-18,"Celebrated a friend's birthday here . We ordered the Beef Rendang , chicken curry and Chap Chye . The Beef Rendang was outstanding . Full of flavor, wonderful kaffir lime fragrance, super tender Wagyu, deep , rich gravy. This dish was the best for me . And not forgetting desserts. Both the Sago Gula Melaka and Buah Keluak Ice cream were to die for ."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",1,25-Nov-16,"Can't be worse for customer service.  Refused to let in customers who came 3min after 230pm as the ""kitchen had closed"".  If you can have an incremental revenue, and there isn't significant incremental cost to opening the kitchen, it just boils down to inflexibility and a distinct lack of customer service and empathy. We had to make significant sacrifices to our schedule and beat the crazy Singapore traffic to just get here and then get turned away. There have been many other restaurants that have been many times more accommodating.  Well, it is the first time I am here and it will probably be the last time that I am. Even though I never ever got a chance to taste the food, it has left me a strong and nasty taste."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,4-Sep-17,"Great food and excellent service.  The best thing we tried was the Wagyu Beef Rendang, but we also enjoyed the charcoal grilled chicken satay, water spinach and Kueh Pie Tee. All were tasty.  The fish chips they bring to start are also delicious."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",3,6-Dec-16,"The decor was rustic with straw lamp shades. Fast service. We had starters with satay, stewed vegetables that you scooped into fried pastry cups and prawn crackers. Then mains with steaming hot rice, beef rendang coconut strength, vegetables in mild spicy sauce and coconut water from the shell. Good service with older waiting staff. KK had the chendol or green jelly with coconut. The flavors smacked of Singapore in the 21st century. The charm of old Melaka in the food was cloaked by the modern Sporean fog."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",4,21-Aug-17,"Candlenut serves modern/fusion Peranakan food, and in our opinion, quite well. They moved from Chinatown to COMO at Dempsey. While the dining area is a little haphazard, there is a weird charm to it. We ate here before and after the star, and tried both omakase menu and ala carte items. The dishes are always on point. Waitstaff and cheerful and pleasant. Needless to say, we will be back."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",4,25-Jan-17,"I actually think this is a great restaurant. All the items we ordered were excellent. Not only they were very tasty, they were also very unusual. The fried rice were black due to the spices but were incredibly tasty. Price was expensive but it is worth for special occasion."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",1,5-Mar-17,"Bad attitude Reservation Lady. Zero service.  Our first time to this place. Walking into Candlenut, the place has a great ambience which makes you feel like you will be having a good night and great food. Was looking forward to it. The problem is the ATTITUDE of the Reservation Lady. We booked a week before and she said couldn't find our name. Arrogance And Pompous ATTITUDE not to mention slowness and lack of response No APOLOGY And ARGUMENTATIVE. And all these was played out in front of the kids. It was so embarrassing. With the hype on this place, being a one Michelin , we had our expectations heighten too but it is intolerable not to have someone who understands customer relationship management. This was supposed to be a special night out but she messed it up."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",5,15-Oct-18,"I cannot recommend this restaurant enough, the food is utterly delicious, beautifully presented and the service, ambience and d¨¦cor of the restaurant itself is faultless. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed the tasting menu here when we were recently on holiday in Singapore and would urge anyone visiting this restaurant to choose the tasting menu option and it will give you an opportunity to try the wide array of flavours and to really enjoy the talents of the chef - particularly the dessert options! We were really impressed with the attention to detail - from the flowers on the table, the crockery and glasses, to the restrooms, there seemed to be no aspect of the entire experience which had been overlooked. A very cool place with sophisticated and delicious dishes."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",4,3-Mar-17,"overall tasty fusion modern peranakan (Chinese Malay) with good service in a nice open lively setup in Dempsey. not sure why the other reviews are harsh. the portions are quite small but allows for sampling. ""ahma kase"" menu available but tried a la carte: Homemade Kueh Pie Tee Shell Hamachi Tartare, Pickled Shallot, Laksa Leaf Pesto, unique Wing Bean Salad, Baby Radish, Lemongrass, Cashew Nuts, Prawns, Calamansi Lime Dressing, great texture and refreshing flavor Buah Keluak of Braised Local Chicken with Peranakan Signature Black Nut Sambal, unique flavor, slightly dry but like a oaxacan mole Grilled Spice-marinated Blackmore Wagyu Beef Satay, yummy Blue Swimmer Crab Curry Turmeric, Galangal, Kaffir Lime Leaf, bold flavor and tasty Baby Sweet Potato Leaves Spicy Dried Shrimp Sambal Westholme Wagyu Beef Brisket Rending Serunding, Turmeric Leaf, soft and flavorful dessert with the buah keluak and chocolate also worked very well."
Candlenut,4.1,61,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean, Chinese",3,3-Dec-16,"This restaurant should more accurately be described as a peranakan fusion restaurant. I am a peranakan and frankly have not sampled an authentic peranakan restaurant in Singapore. Since this is a fusion restaurant, I did not have high hopes, in spite of them having won a Michelin star. The restaurant decor is sparse but pleasant. Service was very attentive and really friendly. 5 stars. They had a regular menu you would expect from this type of restaurant, but with twists to the traditional recipes. For example, the ayam buah keluak had decent flavor but the emphasis was the chicken, whereas traditional food is the opposite. Likewise the prawn petai, flavors were there, but the emphasis was the fresh prawns, not the petai. All in all the food was decent, but not spectacular. If you are expecting authentic peranakan, you will be disappointed. However they were true to their advertisement, fusion peranakan. A downside was the pricing, quite expensive, about $70 per person."
The Reading Room,4,6,"Bars, Cafes",5,25-Nov-13,"We were on our way to another cafe but spotted The Reading Room enroute. The charming facade looks cozy and enticed us to make a quick stop to view the place.  We ended up staying for an hour and a half!  Very cozy atmosphere with unique, vintage-like decoration. The coffee was average in quality but the atmosphere was the pull factor for us to return the next time.  Book lovers will rejoice as the place is a good, quiet hide-out from the busy world to have a cuppa and to have a good reading session. For those who want a place to chill out with friends and catch-up, there's a bigger seating area at the back for big groups. Board games and card games are also available and placed discreetly on the bookshelves - the trick is to be the first to find them!  Will definitely recommend this place to friends."
The Reading Room,4,6,"Bars, Cafes",3,3-Aug-16,"We visited this place because we read about their Truffles promotion. The decor certainly is very impressive with books neatly arranged from wall to wall and old phones decorated at various locations. The ambience is great for catch up with friends over a drink.  We've ordered our main courses all from the promo menu and truffle Parmesan fries. It took close to 20 mins before the fries arrived followed by pasta and burger. The Pork neck grill took another 10 mins to be delivered. Sadly, the burger and the Pork neck was more salty than needed while the pasta is blend. We are more sad that with all the truffle shavings on the pasta and pork neck, we can't smell the truffles. Which is very unusual as this is not the first time we've had truffle dishes.  Even with the promotion, each dish is about $28. And for that price, I don't see the value when I have the 3 small pieces of pork neck done like schnitzels, topped with creamy sauce and potato chips that occupied half of the plate. We couldn't finish our food because I get tired chewing the pork neck and the pasta was too blend to warrant anymore consumption. The saving grace is the burger because it's not too big and, the parmesan fries has a very nice truffle mayo dip.  I really want this place to work out better for customers because they are in a very nice location and the decor is great!  I re"
The Reading Room,4,6,"Bars, Cafes",5,14-Nov-16,"You can really feel a connection with the staff here, you enter a cosy and warm cafe that serves excellent food and drinks. Pros: Books, pool table, cigars and great whisky. Cons: Not closer to my home"
The Reading Room,4,6,"Bars, Cafes",4,22-Apr-18,"The Reading Room is really an interesting quirky cafe for some good drinks & reading time. We visited this cafe for a Sunday brunch after making a reservation, although the reservation was not a necessity! The moment you step inside the cafe, all the books arranged give you a very good vibe & make you feel you are in a library. They have lot of books of varied interests. We saw some of them even working on laptops or reading books for hours. The staff is really very friendly. One cannot visit this place with less time as it's a laid back cafe vibe with slow service. We ordered Eggs Benedict with portobello & Parmesan crisps and Smashed Avocado with Smoked salmon with Matcha latte & orange juice. While Matcha & juice was tasty & fresh, the food was bland. The food was very mediocre, no taste but it was fresh. This restaurant can be a gem only with better food service, hence did not deserve the 5 star. Overall it's an amazing place to read some books over coffee/tea with no time constraint!"

The Reading Room,4,6,"Bars, Cafes",4,1-Jun-15,"This is by far one of the most interesting places I've seen in Singapore... Set up to look like a library, The Reading Room has a varied selection of books to read (and to purchase) while being a full functioning caf¨¦. I only went for afternoon drinks and was delightfully surprised by very nice happy hour offerings, on glasses of red and white wine as well as on beers, and other drinks. It did look like it had a nice brunch menu, and their burger offerings for dinner looked quite nice. At around 6:30 PM however, they shut off most of the lights, which I think was a real mood killer. No need to have lighting resembling that of a sketchy club, when you are in a nice caf¨¦ where people want to go to talk each other, and in fact, see each other too."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",5,22-Mar-24,"Michelin Bib Gourmand Singapore Style Ramen for $10.80. A bit on the pricey side for local Singaporeans, but comes with a beautiful presentation and contrasting textures that blend effortlessly.  I came specifically to Amoy Street Food to try their ramen and was a bit sad they weren't open on a Sunday at 8 AM like Google Maps suggested.  We decided to try another stall Hong Kee Beef Noodle (#01-42), which was also on our list. Luckily, we ate until 10 AM and saw the owner of A Noodle Story open his stall. Good things happen to those that wait, amirite?  I'm not exactly sure his hours since he works his own schedule. On Sunday morning (3/17/2024), there weren't many stalls open around 9 AM. The owner of A Noodle Story said he's only working a half-day starting at 10 AM. We were his first customers.  His Singapore ramen uses wonton noodles with a side of wonton soup. The wontons were packed with fresh shrimp and spices. The soup was light and aromatic. The ebi fry was crispy and the pork belly was soft and tender. All of the textures paired nicely together. The only thing that didn't wow me was probably the egg. It lacked a little flavor considering it was a soy-flavored egg.  It was also refreshing and sweet to see the owner supporting another stall, the same noodle place we ate at before this one - Hong Kee Beef Noodle (#01-42)."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",5,24-Nov-22,"After doing some research, I wanted to try this place as it's the first Singaporean ramen shop. They are on their way for Michelin status here. The bowl of ramen comes with a perfectly cook egg, a fry ebi, pork wrap, 4 huge pieces of smooth tender char SIU and other toppings. It's serve dry style with the soup on the side.  They only make 100 bowls each day so definitely come early to give it a try.  The ramen noodle isn't your typical ramen noodle, it's more of the chow mei thin noodle type and the soup is clear chicken broth, not the creamy hearty type you get at Japanese shop. It was really good.  I'm not sure I would differentiate this from any of the noodle soup I eat vs ramen but it still pretty good"
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",5,27-Dec-18,"A Noodle Story might be my favorite stall in Singapore.  I heard the wait can be long but I got there at 1:30pm and waited about 20 mins to order and 10 mins for the food. The noodles, egg, wonton, crispy prawn, meat and presentation was prefect. You can get it small or large but when I got there, they were sold out of the large. It was so good that I wish I have ordered two smalls. The bf said this should been a Michelin Star stall.  FYI, they were sold out before closing time. Can't wait to come back to Singapore and eat this."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",4,22-Dec-19,"Singaporean Ramen may not be for me, but the dishes served up at A Noodle Story were so fantastically unique that it's worth your time.  Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  I'd heard horror stories about the lines at A Noodle Story, so my friends and I arrived a full half hour or so before they opened on a rainy Monday early evening. To our surprise, the place was empty, and A Noodle Story went ahead and opened early I think because they felt bad for us. From there everything was peachy and our three dishes came out quickly. Star.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  $12.00 for any Hawker dish is boku expensive, but given the size and complexity of this dish it wasn't in my mind unreasonable. Star.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  So, I really really love the concept of ramen style noodle dishes with little to no broth, and that's more or less exactly what this was with some great peripherals like shrimp wrapped in pan fried noodles and shrimp wontons. Having said that, the entire dish, especially the noodles, were very fishy, which for me is a pretty quick turn off. Even so good stuff and a dream for people who have different taste preferences from my own. Single Star.  Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?  If I could taper off the fishiness this would be a dream dish, so I'd be excited to go back and see if I could get that option. Star."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",4,7-Feb-20,"This place is known for Singaporean ramen - very different from Japanese stuff but with some similar elements like the soft cooked egg, tempura shrimp, charshu. It comes with a bit of their own sauce and broth on the side. Ask for it spicy to get some chili sauce on the side. The noodle was egg based, thin, had a good bite to it, and you can see an old man making the noodles right in front.  It's definitely one of the more expensive stalls. A small is 9 dollars (12 for medium, 16 for large), but they do add special attention to detail. For example, they use the tweezers from fancy restaurants to place the scallions in your bowl and wipe the bowl's edge before serving (I had read the owner trained with chef Andre before).  It's definitely unique and worth checking out."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",4,2-Dec-19,"So here's the thing, I love all the toppings. From the wontons, to the egg, to the crispy prawn, and the ever soft tender char sui. The prawn was my husband's favorite. Think tempura shrimp but next level. The outer crunchy is spiraled and adds this insane texture. The noddles themselves were just okay, but I think it's just because I prefer super soft ramen. But man best toppings ever on a ramen and the presentation is stunning! A work of art."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",3,29-Jul-19,I was really excited to try this but I think this may have been ranked the lowest out of all the hawker dishes I've tried on my trip. It was 8 sgd (pricey) and it was alright.  I'm pretty sure I asked for no chili but got chili anyway in my noodles so I ended up not being able to finish it. At least the pork belly was nice and tender.
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",5,3-Jun-16,"I will never look at ramen the same again...  Singaporean style ramen, is how they describe this spot. It's located on the bottom floor of the Amoy hawker stand. I came right when they opened, because I knew there'd be a long line. Around lunch time, this place is packed with business people on their lunch break.  They have three sizes and I went with the medium. Get the chili!! Once you get your bowl, mix it all up! Their cha-su is probably the best I've ever had!! Their HK style wontons were beyond amazing! Their crispy wrapped prawn was nice and crunchy! And their egg cooked to perfection! I've never anything so good and it's a must stop if you're in Singapore!!"
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",5,2-Jan-20,"If you are a ramen fan, and would like to try an alternative version, one that has a local twist then you will like this place.  The dish is a blend of Singapore wanton noodle and Japanese ramen. It comes with slices of Japanese style char siew, onsen egg, and a fried shrimp wrapped in potato. While the price tag of S$9 appear to be high for a food center stall, the quality is very good.  You can also opt to upgrade to the special with a whole egg, additional shrimp, and a bowl of mushroom with fish maw for S$16. That's what I did and I enjoyed it thoroughly!"
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",5,9-Oct-18,"Aww yeah!!! I was full already, but that didn't stop me from stuffing myself with noodles from this place. We went here early because we knew there will be a line up. But I made a rookie mistake of having juice from a nearby stand (after only finishing breakfast about half an hour before... Late breakfast... :-p ).  But geeze was it worthed going there and feeling like I could explode from eating too much this morning. We only realized that the noodles has prawns in it when I started to order, and then we found out the broth is seafood based as well. Luckily, can they were nice enough to whip up a simple broth for me. Even though I'm sure it's not as good as the normal broth, it was still awesome. And the char siu...it melts in the mouth. Every mouth full was loaded with flavor. Definitely worth the visit."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",4,5-May-19,"Michelin Bib Gourmand noodle stall in Amoy Street Food Center.  Nicknamed Singapore's ramen, the noodle dish is a fun bowl of slightly springy noodle (super good texture) and rich soup (on the side). Other accompaniments: shrimp wonton, egg, pork slices, fried shrimp ball are all tastey though not mindblowing  Waited an hour for this - was it worth it? I guess so I could try it out but wouldn't line up again"
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",5,5-Sep-15,"Singaporean-style ramen? Yes, please! Came to the Amoy Street Food Centre with a mission to eat at Noodle Story. It's on the first floor and has a really nice sign and exterior. And a long line of people waiting for food, which is a good sign. I waited like 20-25 minutes to order. There's just one thing, the noodles, but you can get small, medium, or large. And you can add on extra sides (like an extra egg or more HK style wontons). The lady behind me said that the larger sizes just come with more noodles. After I placed my order for a small bowl, the light for the sign went out. The lady behind me said that that meant they ran out of stuff! I had such good timing!  The noodles were SO delicious! No broth. Noodles were amazing. The hard-boiled egg was cooked perfectly. The potato wrapped shrimp was super tasty. And the wontons and chashu pork were yummy! A perfect 10. My noodles also came with a soup. Totally worth the wait!!!"
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",5,23-Aug-19,"They call this a ""Singaporean Ramen"". I don't think that's an actual thing, but the ramen is fairly unique and not like a traditional ramen at all.  The main different is the toppings. The soup has wontons in it that are super delicious. However, the highlight is the single fried potato dumpling. Holy crap that dumpling is delicious. It was so delicious, like a super crunch, deep-fried, curly fry."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",4,1-Feb-18,"This Singaporean take on ramen is special. Each ingredient - the egg, beef, wonton, etc - is delicately and carefully prepared, and assembled into one delicious bowl.  Queue nowhere near as bad as people here have suggested (30~ minutes at 1220 on a Thursday) for a (by hawker standards pricey) $9 bowl of ramen."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",5,11-Mar-19,"Termed the ""Singapore ramen"", this take on our traditional wanton noodles is a winner in every aspect.  High quality ingredients prepared well, yet at a relatively much lower price point (starts from $8) when compared to similarly quality ""ramens"". Where else can you find such a rare gem? It's no wonder the lines are out the door every single day.  Al dente noodles, melt-in-your-mouth pork, perfectly marinated ramen-style eggs (hard whites, runny yolks), crispy wantons, full-flavoured umami-packed soup (only available if you dine at the hawker). Just take my $$$$.  Yes, you can definitely find ordinary wanton noodles at more than half that price, but you get what you pay for. Some people complain about the lines and the high price for a ""hawker"" dish, but if you really consider the premium ingredients and time/effort taken to prepare every bowl, is $8 really too much? (The same argument goes for most other hawker dishes, actually. Why are people willing to pay more for ""cafe"" food, which often takes way less effort to prepare, at perhaps 3x the price with minimal complaints?)  Be prepared to wait at least 30 mins during lunch time. Thinking of going later to avoid the queue? You may be disappointed, sometimes they close early as they run out of ingredients, learnt that the hard way :( So go early when they open (before lunch, or before dinner) to avoid disappointment.  They have an express queue which comes at a premium of $2 per bowl. Well worth it if you're crunched for time but absolutely must try this.  Pro-tip: if you're in the CBD area, Noodle Story is sometimes delivered on GrabFood under their ""Hawker"" initiative."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",5,1-Feb-19,"Despite this hawker stall is a bit out of the way and not as popular, A Noodle Story is definitely worth a visit! I came in the early dining hours and there was already a line up. And I unfortunately had to wait behind a person that ordered 10 noodles to go! Nevertheless, the noodle here was nothing like I've had before. There are so much ingredients in one order and everything tastes amazing."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",5,28-Dec-18,"This was delicious! I got a small and it was a perfect amount for one. The distinct textures between the dumplings, soft boiled eggs, noodles, and fried prawns were so playful and tasty. Absolutely recommend!"
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",5,3-Aug-17,"50 minute wait. We got into the line at 12:22 and got our food at 10 minutes past one. If you have that kind of time this place worth the visit.  We got two small bowls of Singaporean style ramen and we both enjoyed it a lot!  The noodles, the broth, all the dressings were phenomenal. The slow cooked egg was silky and creamy. Chirashi pork was delish!  My boyfriend wants to come back here again after the rush hour, as you can see the line getting significantly shorter after 1:30pm. And they are open till 7:30  Also since it was hard for me to find the food center I bookmarked Gayatri Restaurant, the place right outside of it, so it's easy to find it next time. The hawker center is two stories, and the Noodles are in the ground level.  $7 SGD per small bowl of ramen. I think it's worth it."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",4,16-Jul-18,"The noodles definitely achieve the shop's goal of serving ""gourmet noodles at hawker prices."" The flavors in the dish are extremely fresh and the broth is very well-seasoned. 4 stars just because the service - while trying to operate most efficiently in a small space - can be a bit awkward, as you're prompted to state your order while still halfway down the line, at a point when you can't actually read the menu, so it's tough to decide any additions / modifications you may want to make to the order other than the size of the portion. Although the wait is not nearly as bad as other reviews make it out to be - once I had located the stall, I maybe waited 20 mins in total between joining the line and receiving my food at 12:30pm, peak lunch hour."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",4,9-Jun-14,"My bowl of noodles was meticulously prepared, reminiscent of the care that goes into a bowl of Japanese ramen.  It was certainly a step up in ingredient quality from the usual hawker fare.  I do however agree with other reviewers that the dumplings and chashu lack an umami punch. My guess is that they don't use MSG, but unlike Japanese ramen shops, don't have enough ingredients that contribute their own umami.  Of course, these are small grouses given the very reasonable price of $5.5-$7.5. It's certainly worth a try if you're near Amoy."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",4,29-Aug-17,"I was intrigued when I heard that there's a Singapore-style Ramen. My friend, who lives there brought me here when I visited last July. For me, this Ramen tasted like your typical wonton noodles with a lot of add-ons. Aside from wontons, they added a runny egg, potato crisp covered prawn and char siu. I like how they thought about making this bowl of noodles in a typical hawker set-up. Overall, I would say it's worth a try!"
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",3,28-Oct-16,"Visited this shop approximately a month ago. Came with a high expectation amid the fanfare generated by the Michelin announcement, and the plethora of cool pictures on Instagram.  Ordered the jumbo plate and it was.... okay. Many people loved its concept of a Singapore-style ramen, but it was fusion-confusion for me. Personally, I found it pretty weird to be eating a wanton (Chinese dish) immediately after a cha-shu (Japanese dish), In entirety, the taste profiles of the ingredients just did not blend elegantly enough. In addition, I found the noodles too cluttered in a lump, making it tough to eat. Finally, the chilli looked cool, but tasted pretty dry.  Nonetheless, I was deeply impressed by the quality of the ingredients, and that the owners decided not to cut corners despite the price point and hawker-food positioning. The potato wrapped prawn was also pretty incredible - crunchy and tasty. And yes, the bowl of noodle was full of cool ingredients that would make it very much Instagram-worthy.  Does it deserve a Bib Gourmand? Probably not for me, although the owners are still pretty young and will only go up from there. I applaud their audacity to sort of reinvent the wheel, and I look forward to trying their dish again in a year."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",4,3-Mar-14,"I think that it may be wrong to come to this stall with the intention of tasting typical wanton mee. The stall owner describes this as a Singaporean style ramen. An apt description.  Everything here is done as per ramen standards. The soup, the pork belly( imported from Spain and cooked sous vide for 36 hours) to the potato wrapped prawns and HK style wanton. Careful attention and detailed work. The result? A damn good bowl of wan ton mee. Don't expect the fiery chilli like eng's or the one at da Jie. But come here if you want a take on wanton mee by a new generation of chefs."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",5,27-Sep-19,"The queue was long, the price was high (for a hawker vendor), but the food LIVED UP TO EXPECTATION. This is not a ""ramen"" shop by any Japanese means--for ramen, broth is half the meal, here, it's a dry bowl filled with pan-fried yumminess. Be sure to add this place to your Singapore experience."
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",5,27-Mar-19,It is worth the wait. Waits in hawker centers are common for good food. Most of them seem to be worth it. This one is definitely worth it. Get there before it becomes a bigger thing. Singapore style ramen has been created and this is it. In my top 5 ramens of all time. Best of luck to A Noodle Story. Actually they really don't need it. They are already there.
A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",3,16-Apr-13,"It was pretty good but not amazing, somehow. Perhaps I was just missing the typical random stalks of veg that come with normal wanton mee.. Also I prefer normal char siew to the cha shu that they provided here (think layers of fat + meat, I really do not like fat in my meat).  Anyway, $5 noodle bowl does come with a fair bit of stuff - yummy potato strip-wrapped prawn (deep fried and certainly crisp! nice texture); 3 slices cha shu; 3 pcs wonton (v bouncy w prawn inside); fried shallots; some seasoning or other which adds some sweetness to the sauce. Pretty gd sambal too! Mee is the wonton mee texture, probably my favourite type of noodles :)  It does take a while to get your food though.. Oh, it also comes with a bowl of soup."

A Noodle Story,4.4,30,"Food Stands, Ramen, Singaporean",4,7-Oct-17,Our last day in town and we got there around 2pm and they were sold out as we were in line. The young owner explained that they ran out of a few toppings. We said we didn't care and we would be happy if he can give us what he has left. The noodle was fine but the chef owner was so kind that the experience was a good one. We took pictures with the chef and got our noodle story as the last customer that day.

It felt a little too dry for me (personally prefer it with slightly more fat) and it wasnt that easy to bite it off the bone.  The interesting thing about the soup is, though it's actually pretty good, it does taste slightly different upon each refill. Sometimes it's more peppery and flavourful, sometimes it tastes almost like hot water.  It's generally not a very crowded restaurant but people do consistently stream in for their meal. Not a bak kut teh that's top of my list but it's good enough to just get the tummy filled for the night."

Not that its bad, but conveniently located near Zouk, Ya Hua is the ideal place to sober up after a night of partying. The clear pepper broth is both refreshing and flavourful and combined with the succulent and tender prime ribs, makes it a meal fit for a king. As I'm not a fan of innards, I can only base on what my friends who consume it tell me, and that it's the best they've had. You don't have to be a fan of the peppery type of bak kut teh to enjoy this delicious bowl of soup. That's how good it is."

Nanyang Old Taste,5,1,Singaporean,5,23-Aug-18,"What gets better than great coffee? Great coffee with awesome atmosphere.  The traditional interior design at Nanyang Old Taste is esquisite! The whole place is like a museum, a time way to the past where things way, with corners displaying old coffee making tools and furniture.  This is what I love about Singapore, she's a modern metropolitan city but you can easily find a corner where history, culture and tradition is not lost but retained and appreciated. Sipping a cup of coffee at @nanyangoldcoffee is precious! In particular, I love the old school phone where you have to turn the dial and the coffee filter which is aka a stocking.  More importantly, the coffee is rich and intense, pulled from a height to give it bubbles and texture. Absolute perfection!"
Jumbo,4.3,13,"Seafood, Singaporean",4,27-Nov-23,"We had: - vegetable beancurd with crab meat - beef fillet with black pepper sauce - mocha pork ribs - recommend! - kang kong stir fried with sambal - Chinese chives - super recommend! - award-winning chili crab (mud crab) - supreme seafood fried rice - fried noodles Hong Kong style - mango sago pomelo x2  We really liked that we could choose to get small, medium or large portions of the items so we got the small portions for all and the four of us got to taste more dishes and finished everything too. The Chinese chives was my personal favorite, it was soooo good. The chili crab was delicious too, although it was a bit too spicy and sweet for our liking. I honestly was a bit disappointed given how famous Singapore and Jumbo is for it. The mocha spare ribs and fried noodles Hong Kong style were both delicious. There isn't really anything we wouldn't have gotten, the only thing that was just okay is beef fillet with black pepper sauce.  Service was very good, and the vibes were good too. Very clean and fancy (although you don't have to dress fancy thankfully)."
Jumbo,4.3,13,"Seafood, Singaporean",4,18-Jan-24,"This Jumbo location has a different meaning for reservation. We had one for 8pm but still had to wait another 45 minutes because the table wasn't ready (!?). Anyway, the food is decent albeit pricey (kinda understandable given the location). The interior is interesting as you are seated right besides the neon lights and scrolling banner for ION Orchard. So might not be ideal for people who are sensitive to strobe lighting."
Jumbo,4.3,13,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,15-Feb-24,No need to day too much The best of Chinese type sea food All good Never and none bad chicks
Jumbo,4.3,13,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,11-Nov-22,"Deliciousness perfected!  I've been to Jumbo twice and loved it everytime. They now sell their famous cereal prawns, chili's crab and peppered crab sauces for you to make at home!  My favorite dishes my latest visit was the cereal prawns which is made with Chinese oatmeal on crispy prawns (small order for two people is enough) and the Chinese spinach braised with conpoy & century egg is wow. I didn't expect much from it but the spinach and eggs went so well together. The sauce is ace! Must order these two. Chili crab isn't spicy and half a crab was more than enough for two people, and the Alaska King crab was 50% so we opted into it since it's the meater of the three crab options. Our bill still came out to be around $335 USD OR $468 SGD for 6 dishes (we finished it all!) - pricier end for this meal, but worth the experience. The Luo Han Guo drink as a fave mine as it was refreshing and healthy with the meal. They have gloves and wet wipes for those that need it.  Pro tip: make rsvp to avoid waiting in line."
Jumbo,4.3,13,"Seafood, Singaporean",3,14-Nov-22,"My husband and I unfortunately had a very unlucky experience at Jumbo. We had a reservation at 11:30am on a Monday and ordered within 10 minutes. We ordered a monkfruit juice, bbq pork buns, glutinous rice in clay pot, and chilli alaskan crab. The bbq pork buns came out within 5 minutes but everything else took over 30 minutes, including our water that the server accidentally forgot about. Our service button was also broken so it took forever to hail down any server even with our hand raised. After our server finally came, we discovered that our chilli crab order was given to the wrong table so the already super busy kitchen had to make another one for us (it took about an hour to finally receive it). We spoke to the manager and he offered us a free dessert to compensate the wait - we asked for our bbq pork buns and monkfruit juice to be compensated instead and he agreed (he also gave us the free mango dessert anyway which we appreciated).  The food itself tasted pretty good but I do agree with other reviewers that it's overpriced, especially the crab. The bbq pork buns were tasty but also the smallest I've ever seen (hand in photo for a size comparison lol)."
Jumbo,4.3,13,"Seafood, Singaporean",2,27-Nov-23,Very expensive chain in Singapore Pepper crab was about $250 and not easy to eat or worth the effort. Friend threw up afterward at the hotel.
Jumbo,4.3,13,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,15-Dec-21,"The tasting menus here are the way to go here to try a bit of everything. There are 3 tiers you can choose from with varying dishes and of course prices. We decided on B and were not disappointed. There was never too long of a wait between dishes and everything was nicely presented. Of course, the chili crab is the main attraction. You're provided with a bib and some gloves but be prepared to get messy. The gloves are actually more of a pain to use when trying to de-shell, you're better off using your hands! But all the work that goes into it is worth it in the end. What deliciousness! Also found the cheese baked king prawn and beancurd with fresh mushroom to be fantastic as well. Can't go wrong!"
Jumbo,4.3,13,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,29-Nov-19,"Chili crab - great tangy spicy sauce, first time, mud crab meat sturdy and meaty compared to Dungeness in San Francisco. Enjoyed a lot.  Mirugai sashimi - perfect  Good set menus for 2-12 people, good combos.  Upscale super fast accurate friendly service upstairs in a mall of crazy rich Asian stores like frank mueller and Harry Winston.  Everything was delicious and well priced."
Jumbo,4.3,13,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,2-Jun-22,"This location is inside Ion Orchard Mall, 4th floor. As a tourist it was easy to get to via the metro. I highly recommend ordering the chili crab and or black pepper crab with fried mantou to soak up the sauce. Pro tip: Save your receipt if it's over $50 as you can redeem it for one free drink and access to the 56th floor Ion Sky. Sip your free cocktail while enjoying the city skyline."
Jumbo,4.3,13,"Seafood, Singaporean",4,23-May-19,"Absolutely delicious spicy chili crab. The reason why I didn't give them 5 stars was due to not having the Alaskan crab. They have a good size selection of wines but very limited for wine by the glass.  For appetizer the Jumbo chili crab bun is very delicious, in fact everything here is delicious."
Jumbo,4.3,13,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,2-Oct-19,"We came at 1:57 pm and we were sat right away. They do close at 3:00 pm so they were trying to get our order ready ASAP. That was nice, we were hungry! We were lucky enough to get 50% off Alaskan crab and we had it done it two ways: with pepper and with chilli (tradicional Singapore style). I'd like to thank the waiter that took our order cause we didn't know how spicy the chilli sauce was going to be and he was gracious enough to bring me a little sample of it. And we loved it! We also had noodles with seafood and sodas. The crab took a little while to cook (as expected) we actually saw our 2.2 Kg crab before was cooked (sorry!). They do bring you water for your finger tips, wipes, and a few pair of gloves all together with the seafood scissors and tools to make sure you get the last piece out of your crab! It's not cheap but the price it's fair for the flavor, service and quality you get. I recommend!"
Jumbo,4.3,13,"Seafood, Singaporean",4,29-Sep-19,This place is the Singapore signiture restaurant. They are famous with their Singapore Chilli Crab. It is a National dish. The taste is awasome and must try.  Prepare to get messy eating with your finger. Super Yummyyyyyyyy.
PS Cafe,4.3,7,Pizza,3,11-Apr-24,"We had a gathering there. The place is conveniently located and has good ambience. Food was alright. The portions were very generous. We ordered the BBQ ribs, Thai prawns and Basil Chicken with rice, Chicken Rossa Penne and the Barramundi. Service could be much better. There were not enough cuttlery for 5 of us, not enough napkins and we had to look for service staff to order drinks and to ask them to clear the table."
PS Cafe,4.3,7,Pizza,4,31-Mar-19,"Delish breakfast in a lovely view with the skyline of Singapore lagoon. I had the mushroom souffle which was good. The PS brunch stack (pork sausage patty, potato hash, fried egg) was absolutely yummy. Eggs Ben great too. #maneklady #manekeats"
PS Cafe,4.3,7,Pizza,3,18-Mar-18,"Came here for brunch on a Sunday. The hostess was very friendly, welcoming and quick to help us. The restaurant is well laid out and decorated and has a great view. The server was nice and helpful as well. We ordered food and were quickly served and taken care of. The food was just ok though for the price level and the biggest reason I couldn't rank it higher. The menu was a good mix of healthy combinations but the flavors where just off.  Bottom line..come here for the ambience and service. The place is great to come dressed in business casual or fashionable attire.  Pros Friendly staff Nice decor Nice location Good layout  Cons Hard to find the main entrance Food flavorings were off and not worth the price range"
PS Cafe,4.3,7,Pizza,5,30-Aug-19,"Great staff. Great view. Good food quality too (the good cuts of meats, not the leftovers you get in the hawker locations.) great desserts! A bit pricy but for the area it's normal."

Blue Lotus Chinese Eating House,4.3,6,Chinese,5,31-Dec-17,Great food. Great service. The lamb is superb. The rice bowl is excellent. Emerald is a wonderful hostess and kept our table covered with splendid service.
Blue Lotus Chinese Eating House,4.3,6,Chinese,4,23-Feb-18,"Kids: we liked the shrimp fried rice, chicken thighs and bok choy. Also the lime soda.  Adults: we came here during Chinese New Year and it was a packed house. Come early or make a reservation if you want a seat on the patio under the colorful lanterns with a marina view. The pomelo chilli crab is their house specialty and worth trying. It's a commitment though! Definitely enough to feed 4 people. We also liked the saut¨¦ed prawns. Oddly, they only had Chinese and Japanese beers, no Tiger."
Blue Lotus Chinese Eating House,4.3,6,Chinese,4,25-Nov-16,One of the options in a row of restaurants facing the water and yachts. The staff were very cheerful and courteous. The big colorful lanterns created a nice ambience. We ordered fried salmon skin with salted egg which was really crispy and addictive. The braised mee pok with XO sauce and jumbo prawns was nicely done but my friend found the prawn head bitter. The spinach with two different kinds of eggs was well-cooked. Prices are reasonable for the quality and serving size is generous. Certainly worth checking out!
Blue Lotus Chinese Eating House,4.3,6,Chinese,4,21-Sep-13,"Singapore's most (debatably) desirable dish comes to Singapore's most ""desirable"" address, at indigestible prices. 3 words: Chili Pomelo Crab. Order it.  This is the only Chinese restaurant at the atas (read: posh) Quayside Isle row of restaurants in Sentosa Cove. After passing an entire row of the same old yawn-inducing ""Mediterranean"", Italian, and American-themed offerings, the brightly coloured lanterns of Blue Lotus Eating House first caught my eye, then the interesting menu items.  There is only one dish you should order here, and that is the Signature Chili Pomelo Crab. A twist on the much-loved local dish, the gravy has a certain zing to it (I tasted lemongrass and tamarind) and enhanced with the refreshing citrus flesh of the pomelo scattered on top. It came with 6 small fried buns. They use huge sri-lankan crabs (scylla serrata), and the crab weighed in at around 1.6kg. At $7.80/100g, the price was not easy on the pocket. (*You* do the math)  Other interesting dishes are the Szechuan style ""fish and chips"", an appetiser of battered and deep fried fish skin and small fish, and the wagyu beef & foie gras fried rice. The rice had that wonderful ""wok hei"" aroma with deep fried rice puffs mixed in. However the wagyu beef and foie gras bits were lost in the mixture and their flavour could barely be tasted. What a waste of high end ingredients. The wok fried mussels were also forgettable. The mussels were fresh, but the spicy black bean sauce was meh.  The other minor thing was the use of these fancy decorative dishware. Definitely decorative-only and impractical. Some of them were kidney shaped and really reminded me of those surgical dishes I see at the dentist or hospital. They barely held any sauce and soon overflowed with crab shells.  Sitting facing the yachts moored outside with the mostly foreign customers milling about inside, I almost felt like I wasn't in Singapore anymore... then I took Sentosa Bus No. 3 out..."

Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,20-Jan-24,"What: bak chor mee (assorted pork noodle)  90+ years old. Michelin one star (2023 Guide).  Bak Chor Mee. Springy egg noodles, braised lean pork, flash boiled ground pork, braised pork liver, smooth spongy seasoned pork meat ball, crispy pork cracklins and dried flounder all tossed in a flavorful sauce of spicy sambal, dark sweet soy, fish sauce, and black vinegar. Mix it all up and enjoy the umami explosion.  Be sure to chase mouthfuls of the noodles with the accompanying pork and seaweed soup made from the braising liquid.  Tip: Arrive before opening (09:30), grab a number and queue else expect to wait.  Two sizes, medium and large. Paying more equals more toppings.  A truly multi dimensional bowl. Outstanding."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,25-Apr-24,"For bak chor mee they're friggin' delicious. Splurge for the large as it's only SGD 2 more.  However, the wait ranges from annoying (20 minutes) to downright painful, and the hawker stall complex they're in has juuuuust enough seating. Why they're so slow sometimes seems like a bit of a mystery. Try to get under a fan so you don't sweat to death.  Almost 5* but man, the wait is killer."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,30-Jun-24,"Taking 1* off because the wait was 2 hour long on Saturday night and they close the line at 7pm (official closing hour is 8:30pm) so make sure to come early. The kitchen definitely takes their own sweet time preparing just 1 bowl at time. You can actually pre-order via WhatsApp +65 9272 3920 but has to be able to transfer payment to UEN 53444392C. For tourists, this might be doable via wise.com but I didn't try since I thought their wait shouldn't be too bad. By the time we got to order at 8:20pm, the kwetiau soup has sold out so we only got their OG dry noodle (love the perfectly crispy salted dish, wish there's more) & meatball soup (you also get some of the meatball in the dry noodle but it is so good that you probably want some extras). The meatball has juhi (dried cuttlefish) inside which makes it extra special P.S. You will get free soup on the side for dry noodle if you dine-in, but not for takeout"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,30-Nov-23,"This is the original Tai Hwa Hill Street Pork Noodles @ 466 Crawford Lane which has One Michelin Star.  Today this stall was manned by the man without specs (see photo from years ago). Didn't see the guy with specs who's the boss.  They now have a takeaway stall to the extreme left of the coffee shop manned by someone else.  I happened to be nearby around 4.20 p.m. today.  The guy said they'd start in 20 mins so I took a queue number 6.  After 20 mins, he was yelling for us to queue up. Then he called out the numbers and we just stood there for awhile. Then he called out the numbers again one by one and took our orders. Then we lined up to collect our food.  This place usually has a queue for an hour if not more during lunch time.  They open until 8 p.m. but I'm not sure if the dinner queue is as crazy.  I have not eaten this for like 3 decades.  I felt that the pork balls were not as springy as before and were now more tender and very much smaller which affects the mouthfeel if you know what I mean.  The sauce is still very good. I would always order Mee Pok (flat yellow noodle) dry. Their liver is good & they added the ""teek poh"" (deep fried flat fish) which you hardly find at hawker stalls nowadays.  They won't give soup (with seaweed & the hard to find preserved vegetable) for takeaway orders.  They don't charge extra for takeaway box.  Would I queue an hour for this? Probably not but I could still eat it again before 5 p.m.!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,22-Dec-23,"1 star Michelin hawker stand - delicious food and worth it (even with confusing order process + gruff service).  We got the soup noodle and dry noodle (medium size). Soup noodle had really great mix of meats, wonton, meat balls, and liver. Noodle melts in your mouth. I actually preferred the dry noodle, which had a lot of the same stuff but a very nice al dente noodle and a light sour vinegar flavor.  Order process - wait in pickup line until someone calls you to the order line, leave your place in line to order, then go back to your place in line and pay the person who gives your food.  For drinks, got the 3 type coffee tea combo and iced lemon tea, both tasty!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,22-Dec-22,"BEFORE YOU READ: **CASH ONLY**  If you're looking for one of the cheapest Michelin meals in the world ($6!), you've come to the right place. Just don't have high expectations.  Reading reviews and seeing YouTube vlogs about this spot beforehand, we were expecting an hour wait. We came here on a Sunday afternoon and to our surprise, there was hardly a line. We waited about 15 minutes before ordering and another 5 minutes to get our food. There are two lines to order food, both with the same menu. If you have a large party, have someone in your party take all the orders and the rest of you sit down as seating is limited.  The noodles are cooked to order, are chewy, dense, and the broth was spicy. However, given that this holds a 1 Michelin star rating, we were expecting to be blown away."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,24-Nov-22,"We came here because it was one of the affordable 1 Michelin star restaurant :) We got there right when it open and there was already a line. The line does move but not as quickly as one would like. We were probably the 4th in line and it still took close to 20 minutes to get our food.  We tried the dry noodle and it came with various protein such as liver, wontons, pork, meatballs, etc. The noodles are bouncy and chewy and everything was good. The broth on the side was also really good. Given that this is a 1 Michelin star place, I had a higher expectations but I thought it was the same quality as a lot of the noodle places i have tried at hawker centers.  It's still pretty good though, just nothing extraordinary"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,19-Feb-23,"I was excited to try this place, known worldwide as the cheapest Michelin star meal, and one of the most talked-about food stops among the famous Hawker stall. I got there about 20 minutes after opening and noticed that tons of people were in the right lined but nobody was in the left line. I got in the left line and had my food ready within a few minutes.  Once I sat down with my order of dry noodles that came with a bowl of soup, I dug in. I'll start with the good: the sauce is fantastic, the rich, sour, salty, tangy, spicy chili goodness is delicious, and luckily it coats everything in the dry noodles. I would love to bring a bottle of this stuff home. The pork slices and minced pork were nice and tender & did a good job of soaking up the flavorful sauce. The soup was good as well, it was a miso-y concoction with seaweed, onions, green onions, and some bamboo shoot-y tough vegetable. Despite it being incredibly hot out, it was still refreshing even if it didn't stop me from sweating!  The not so good for me personally, was largely a texture issue. The noodles had this odd paper-y chew through the middle that I found a bit unpleasant. Not the end of the world, but unfortunately that was the best texture in the bowl behind the pork slices for me. The little meatballs were a bit rubbery but had a nice distinct salty, pork-y flavor to them. The stuff I presume to be pork liver was pretty gross to me, it had crumbly texture to it that coated your entire mouth with a bitter flavor while you chewed through a papery middle. I tried to keep eating it, but it was actually making me feel ill, so I gave up. I won't hold the fried pork fat against them since that's something that I just don't like period, so I think that's a me problem, but either way I didn't like it texture or flavor wise. The wonton wasn't anything special & was a bit sad & floppy, didn't add much to the dish in my opinion.  Overall it was an interesting food experience, with high highs & low lows. I would recommend it for the novelty & the sauce alone, but probably won't be the highlight of my trip."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,2-Jan-24,Best pork noodle I had in the past 10years!! Waited for 30mins reasonable for a good meal :)
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,16-Apr-23,The Best Pork noodle in Singapore But queue was amazing at least one hour standing to get your best pork noodle also meat ball you must try
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,11-Oct-21,"The wait can be long (over an hour) so bring something to read. You're going to want to order back chor mee. There are 3 sizes to choose from $6, $8 or $10. Just get the $10. It definitely has unique flavors and you tweak it as you go along with the condiment, but overall hearty and filling. The soup is a great palette cleanser to offset the spice. Where else are you going to find Michelin Star-calibre food for $10? Must experience!  Check out https://youtu.be/TU7GRlUOnK0"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,7-Dec-19,"Simple, delicious, made with heart.  Have you ever eaten at a Michelin-starred spot for $6? Not only is Singapore a dope vacation destination, but it has cheap, delicious food.  I do not read Chinese and didn't quite know if the menu was going to have any English so I chose what I wanted ahead of time. Bak chor mee with dry noodles. OMG this noodle dish is gooooood. Must be the black vinegar that makes it . There are so many different flavors that go into this one dish. It manages to incorporate all of the five basic tastes as well as other textures.  Downside: 1. Long queue to order. 2. Im told the price went up with popularity.  Upside: 1. Deliciousness. 2. Only takes only a few minutes to prepare.  Is it worth it? I think so. Recommend double the noodles and add the soup."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,20-Jul-19,"We showed up on a Monday and saw literally no one in line, cause they were closed. So we tried again the next day right at 9am, before our flight out at noon, thinking that we had plenty of time in between. Man, we were wrong.  First off, we didn't know that we should have got there even earlier to claim one of the 25 tokens that will keep your first 25 spots before the line even started to form. So although there were only about 8 people in front of us when we got in line, it took them 1.5 hour total to go through those 25 tokens and the people in front of the line AND AT LEAST 10 OTHER to-go orders (which, I think, should have been taken care of ONLY AFTER those people who are actually waiting in person).  Food: we ordered 2 Bak Chor Mee and they were tasty. It's a shame that we had to inhale our food right away to leave for the airport; and not so much enjoying it after the long wait. Overall, I think I can go somewhere else for similar noodles without the wait and cheaper price tag (not that $8 was expensive but Singapore just offers so many options for cheap eat).  The verdict: I'm glad that I tried their noodles and it was honestly really good. I can see why they got the Michelin Star. However, I would only go back if the wait is a lot shorter and definitely not before catching a flight in less than 3 hours."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,27-Dec-20,"We arrived 30 minutes before opening to avoid long lines. When you arrive that early, you receive a number and are able to get a drink while waiting at a table... much more relaxing than standing in line. The soup was DELICIOUS! It had the perfect blend of salt, fat, acid, and heat."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,30-Jan-18,"Since this was listed on the Michellin Guide, I have to give it a try. I planned an early dinner visit to avoid the long queues that people reported. Arrived at 5pm and there was a queue but tolerable. Waited 30 minutes for my food. A good estimate of wait time is count the number of people in front of you. Multiply by 2 as each is likely ordering for 2 people. Then multiply by 2 again as it takes 2 mins to prepare a bowl of noodles. So # of people in front of you * 4 = average wait time.  Is it worth waiting more than 30 mins? I don't think so.  The bak chor mee (minced pork Noodles) is ok. Nothing to scream about. I had the $8 dry version with mee pok (flat yellow egg noodles). Good presentation with a big bowl and generous with the meat (sliced pork, minced pork, sliced liver, gyoza and deep fried fish (ti po)). A dash of lettuce and no braised mushrooms. The black vinegar used for the sauce is flavorful which makes bak chor mee good.  There is a ji chai soup for $6 which in my mind is way over priced. Dried seaweed is put into the broth used for the soup version of bak chor mee. Can skip without missing anything.  A good dry version of bak chor mee needs to have mushroom sauce and nice vinegar. This place missed out on the mushroom.  Presentation wise, tai Hwa has it better than others. The over sized bowl makes the noodles very appealing to the eye. Remember it still has a lot of carbs.  My suggestion is to go at off peak times, order the $6 dry or soup version and if wait is longer than 30 mins, come back another time."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,2-Oct-19,It's a great spot in singapore but i feel like it's jumped the shark a bit. You'll find the long lines but not of locals but of tourists. I've had better Pork noodles in singapore at a cheaper price and shorter wait. Yes the noodles stand out but i feel like the soup and ingredients were standard. The fish cracklins were great though. Crunchy and flavorful. It's a try if in the area but i wouldn't go out of ones way to get a bowl.
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,4-Mar-17,"One of the two hawker food stalls awarded a Michelin star! The line can be long, and it does take a while to get your food. But just know that it's because it's a popular spot. Also, they make the noodles one bowl at a time.  Two noodles options: with soup or dry. Both noodles have a mix of pork meat and organs and wontons. We got one of each, and I would say the dry one, bak chor mee, is the more flavorful one. A mix of chili, soy sauce, vinegar on the bottom; freshly cooked noodles on top; then the meats and wontons.  Four sizes available. $5, $6 (regular), $8, $10."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,2-Feb-23,We been eating here many years maintaining standards only getting more expensive!!!! A great place for Breakfast/Brunch/Lunch!!!!!
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,19-Apr-17,The queue was pretty short when I dropped by. It was just a 15 minutes wait. Maybe because the regulars knew that the staffs were going for 15-minutes lunch break soon at 2.30pm. I was lucky to be the second last order to be made before the break. Orders that cannot be completed by 2.30pm would be given a queue number.  The serving looked a tab small for S$10 and served with a bowl of seaweed soup. I was not full after finishing it and seem to be lacking of the wow factor. The sauce was a tab bland although not too vinegary. Like that the pig's liver was cooked just right - tender. There's lots of pieces of crispy flat fish in it.
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,12-Feb-17,"Now that it has received a Michelin star, there are more tourists joining the queue for some bak chor mee.  We went at 5pm on a Friday and it still took about 45 minutes to wait in line for the food. There were about 14 people ahead of me. But we saw there were only 2 people in line at 6pm. Hard to find the sweet spot on when the wait will be shortest.  The queue system is neater now. Halfway through the wait (maybe 5-6 people ahead of you), you will be asked to place your order on the right side and then go back to your queue spot to wait.  The noodle tasted better when eaten at the coffee shop. I ordered the $6 bowl as recommended by other yelpers and it definitely had more ingredients than what I previously remembered. I would have skipped the meatball soup if I knew there were more 2 meatballs in the $6 portion. I ended up with too many meatballs as the soup came with 15 meatballs for $6. It was soft but a bit on the salty side.  I still gave it a 3 stars because of the queue system. Not everyone can stand for that long. I rather you order it and then get a number or buzzer and wait."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,28-Jun-13,"I waited for about 40 minutes in a queue of maybe 10-12 persons before me at 11+am. I seriously do not think a bowl of noodles is worth this long a wait.  The noodle was good and flavorful (lots of vinegar), with nicely cooked meat (not too tough). The dumpling was a bit too big and chewy. The thing I liked most was the fried sole fish (ti poh) which gave a bit of ommph to the noodle.  But to wait for 40 minutes or more? I don't think so. The most I will queue for this will be 20 minutes. For a stall with 4 people working in the kitchen and another taking the order (4-5 people before your turn), the turnover is too slow. And we are not talking about every customer ordering 5-10 bowls of noodles."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,18-Nov-18,"Long lines for this place! I was here mid day and there was still a steady lineup of 10 people or so people. I ordered the bak chor mee after about 30 minutes standing in line. They make 1 bowl at a time and some guy ordered 10!  The noodles are tossed in a vinegar, chilli oil and soy sauce mix which is then topped with what tasted like pork liver, minced pork, a couple of wontons, a couple of meatballs and some additional meat slices. There was also a dehydrated/fried fish slice on top.  They tasted very different from noodles I've had in the past but definitely enjoyed it. Take some additional chilis to add to your bowl!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,24-Sep-19,"They have a few outlets and we went to the one in Upper Cross Street (inside Hong Lim Food Center).  This is a well known establishment whereby the founders started the first stall in 1939. Their pork dumplings are simply delicious and my family always makes it a point to order an extra bowl to share, on top of our S$5 bowl of minced pork noodle.  We have tried many stalls of such noodles and I dare say that Tai Hwa rates as one of the best. In fact, the original stall in Hill Street made it into the Michelin 2019 guide for Singapore."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,14-Dec-19,"Hawker center food is on everyone's list when they go to Singapore, and we started our experience at Tai Hwa for lunch. After waiting in the queue for almost an hour, getting berated by the other stall owners for taking over what used to be a local establishment, and feeling rather mediocre on the food from Tai Hwa, I'm not sure this is worth going out of your way for. Do I think it's a great value for the price paid? Yes absolutely. Would I go out of my way to come here? Probably not. Singapore has many fantastic places that allow you to stretch your dollars as far as you can...but unless you're nearby to Tai Hwa, I'd opt for another place."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,17-Apr-18,"This place gets 4 stars for the 2 hour wait... It just might not be worth it. I know I wouldn't line up again. The only incredible part of this is how slow the line moves. The food is pretty good, and would be on my 5 star list (also has a michelin star) if there wasn't a line. The liver is extremely well done, and tender. The noodles are pretty good, but does this make it significantly better than other bak chor mee places? Nah. It's the best you'll get but not worth the wait if you can go elsewhere. I'd try it once, if there's almost no line, and that's it. People line up before they open so maybe consider getting there very early?"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,29-Jul-18,"Noodle in general is good. Abit salty for me, but still ok lar... however, queues up for 1.5+ for a bowl of pork noodle, maybe not as worth though. U decide..."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,24-Aug-15,"First saw pics of the noodles from Tai Hwa on Instagram and knew this would be one of my first stops during our Singapore trip. After reading a few reviews, I knew to avoid this place during peak times so we ended up coming for a late lunch on a Monday. For some reason the taxi driver dropped us off at the wrong location (not far but ended up walking a few blocks). I was glad to have google maps open so that we could find this place.  We arrived to find a short line and waited about 5 mins before placing our order. For those that don't speak Mandarin, I'm not sure how successful you'll be ordering food here as the guy who took our order did not speak Cantonese and spoke very very little English. It took a total of 15 minutes before we sat down to eat. I ended up with a $5 bak chor mee bowl of noodles and it definitely lived up to the hype! I would definitely wait an hour for a bowl of their dry bak chor mee noodles in a heartbeat! A definite must try when coming to Singapore!!!!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,5-Jul-18,"Michelin 1-Star (2016) coffee shop stall with 1-2 hr long queue. Arrived 11.20am, with over 1 hr wait in line, in hot humidity. Each bowl is freshly individually prepared, average 2-5 min per customer depending on # bowls order at $6, $8, $10. Recommend $6 bowl, better value.  Tasty noodles in chili and vinegar sauce, with pork balls, mince pork, liver, wanton. Good noodles, but not worth 1 hr wait and price. Of Michelin cuisines tasted in France, Germany, Italy, USA, am not sure how this one-star was awarded. At best, only bib gourmand, in my view. Not worth long wait, come off peak hours if curious to try. Many other good bak chor noodles elsewhere with better queues and price."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,1-Jul-17,"One word. AMAZING.  We went on a Tuesday morning, thinking it wouldn't be packed. But when we got to the store at around 10:30, there was already roughly 20 people in line. After roughly 2 hours in the brutal heat and watching countless happy customers bypass us with their freshly cooked noodles, we finally got our orders in.  And let me say this. The wait was totally worth it.  The noodles were hand pulled, very flavourful after soaking up the vinegary soup base. There was a wide selection of minced pork, liver, sliced pork, wontons and crispy fish on the side of the bowl. Plus you could add freshly chopped chili peppers on top to enhance the flavours. The combination of all the toppings was like heaven in a bite. Crunchy, savoury, sour and spicy. Definitely cant go wrong with a meal this good, especially with the pricing being $8 for medium."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,17-Jun-18,Pretty solid place with some awesome flavours. I had the dry noodles and it was really awesome to get so many different pork meat varities in different forms. The sauce is a bit spicy and the soup delicious. Not something I would wait for but worth a one time visit.
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,28-Sep-17,"I got to Tai Hwa 30 minutes after opening and waited in line 1 hour 15 minutes. I appreciated that each batch of meat was cooked to order for just the right amount of time, ensuring tender pork and liver. The noodles were springy and the sauce punchy and well balanced. While I definitely enjoyed my noodles, it was not amongst my favorites in Singapore. If I lived in the neighborhood I would visit again. Otherwise I am sure places with equally delicious noodles and a shorter wait exist. Just have to be in the know I guess!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,15-Nov-16,"I'm not sure what the hype is, but it's basically a pork noodle bowl (Bak Chor Mee) with minced pork, sliced pork, liver, meatballs, wontons, and salted fish. It was pretty good tasting but I felt it had way too much going on in it. Maybe I prefer the simpler dishes I had grown accustomed to during my stay here, but I would say it's not worth going out of your way for. If you absolutely must go, it's probably best to go during the daytime here."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,14-Dec-19,"First off ordering was confusing. Once you get close to the front of the line, they call you to order your dishes on the right side of the stall. You got to pick your dish and what size you want. Now a SGD8 meal is regular size. After you order the dish, you get back in line! I went to the back! But the guy waved me over to get back in my original spot. This was confusing and new people like me will be like WTF. I might have done it wrong too.  The line wasn't too long when we arrived at 11am on a weekday. You get the benefit of the drink stall next door to order drinks. It is fun watching the chef create the dish at the front of the line.  I got the dry and soup noodles. As for the soup noodles, I did not get much flavor in the noodles. I was questioning what was the hype. But then after trying the broth, I knew that was the key. Very flavorful and very thoughtful how they created this dish. The dry noodle dish is good as well. It has strong vinegar taste to it. Also the soup provided is on the sour side. All very good.  I can see it getting hot eating here. You are eating hot food after all. Prepare yourself with fans, and cold drinks."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,25-Oct-16,"I think most Westerners need to be careful with this Michelin Star as it isn't for many taste palates. It is definitely worth a try but I spoke to many foreigners who didn't like the dish.  I arrived at 2:30 on a weekday and there was practically no line/queue. I ordered the $6 bowl and watched the magic happen with the food.  I agree, the noodles are extra springy with a beautiful texture. Otherwise, even for me, the liver was a bit strong for my taste. I still finished my portion fairly quickly and was still hungry so got myself another order. :)  If you can do so, come between the peak hours and just try it out!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,29-Aug-16,"1 hour wait for this one Michelin star bak chor mee noodles! Pretty good time if you ask me.  This was literally the best thing I ate in Singapore! We only came here by chance to try one of the michelin star hawker stalls, and this was most convenient to us. It was the first time I inhaled my food on this trip. I was only there for 4 days, and I've lived in Hong Kong for a while so the Chinese styled food did not wow me but this did! Now I didn't have much expectation for it since it didn't look that appealing but the taste was amazing!  The flat noodles we got had a chewy consistency, al dente, which is how I like mine. The sauce was what made it amazing! Now, I don't typically like my noodles in soup since it makes the noodles soft and soggy. This sauce was spectacular. It had a vinegary taste (which some people may not like), and perfectly salted. Not too strong either. The condiments on top were what differentiated this from just noodles. ...my mouth is watering as I am writing this. The generous slices of liver that melt in your mouth is how they got me. I've never had liver so perfectly cooked before, and I've never liked it due to its chewiness and grainy texture. But this was was just melt in your mouth liver, and it was so good!  Comes with a cup of liver/seaweed soup. It's so good! Reminds me of my momma's soup but taste so much better! I don't know if you can tell, but I love this place.  Everything was cooked so fast too! The line was definitely not appealing but it moves fast so I was quite happy. They were efficient with cooking, and they made everything right in front of you so it was impressive.  Need drinks too? You can go right next to it. Get some coffee or lemon honey. They make it right in front of you! The location may not be the most gorgeous but its the food that matters. Would defos come back if I were in Singapore again!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,2-Oct-16,"As I was on a Michelin food hunt that day, after eating the soy sauce chicken in Chinatown, I immediately headed over to this noodle place for lunch. Unlike the other stall, they don't really advertise their Michelin star and the only way you'll know about it is a small plaque at the very front of the line. I got there at lunch time and it was a little over an hour wait. Be warned that it can get quite hot and humid while waiting as there was only one fan aimed at the queue.  Whilst lining up, I noticed there were signs for a $5, $6, $10, and $12 noodle. Asking around, people said that they were simply denoting the size of noodles but after receiving my order, that's not quite the case. Ordering was a bit daunting but somehow I managed to communicate for a $5 dry, non-spicy Bak Chor Mee. Watching him prepare your bowl of noodle was quite confusing, he was dipping meats and noodles and sauces into different bowls before dumping them all into one. Then after handling the raw meats with his bare hands, he'll handle your cash payment...  When I got my order, I noticed my soup was lacking the seaweed that I had seen in the pictures and inquired why. They simply stated it was because I ordered the $5 version, the full version was at $6, so I found out the hard way the pricing didn't dictate size alone. The noodle came with some minced pork, some liver, a meatball, a wonton, and some crunchy meat that I couldn't identify. Texturally, the dish was very interesting, with bites alternating between crunchy and soft as you ate. In terms of the flavor profile, it really wasn't for me. The vinegar was simply too overpowering and I don't really get the hype with this dish. The side bowl of soup was also quite bland, nothing really special.  If you're a fan of sour and spicy, it might be worth it to give it a try despite the wait, but for people that have a penchant for more savory flavors, give this place a pass."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,5-Aug-16,"Mee Is Worthy  The results are in and all the culinary buzz in Singapore has been filled with nothing but the official Singapore Michelin Guide, about who's worthy and who's not.  I don't normally intentionally queue just to try out the latest recommendations but, since we were in leave on Thursday, a friend of ours had suggested heading over to eat the newly crowned, 1 michelin star Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles. She's been a regular customer there, years before all the hype started but has recently avoided it a bit due to the crazy crowds since the stalls inauguration.  While walking over, we were crossing our fingers as her friend who has ate there the day before, waited an hour during lunch and we were hoping that we would have better luck at 3.30 in the afternoon.  I love my minced pork noodles. The gf knows I have his obsession with it and she could see the excitement in me, knowing that I was not only finally going to satisfy my craving for minced pork noodles but was going to try what is apparently THE BEST minced pork noodles in Singapore now.  When we got there, there were about 12-15 people in the queue, but seeing how fast the owner was churning out each bowl, we decided to queue (Thank goodness).  The speed of his cooking is generally fast, with us only waiting for 30 mins, not too bad considering we had 12-15 people ahead of us with some ordering 2 to 3 bowls.  A first glance at the price kind of shocked me. $5, $6, $8 and $10? That had to be the most expensive Minced Pork Noodles I've come across but once we ordered, I could understand why. Unlike other minced pork noodles, Tai Hwa was very generous with their ingredients. A good serving on minced pork, lots of liver, sliced pork, crispy fried fish (Bian Yu), 2 meatballs and 2 large dumplings, it certainly was value for the $6 (which is their regular size).  While I went with the traditional Mee Pok (flat noodles) with Chilli, the gf, who doesn't take chilli went with the Mee Kia (thin noodles) with no chilli. First words of advice? Go with the chilli, or just a little bit of you're not a chilli eater. The key of any dry noodle dish, to me, is the sauce it comes with and while the non-chilli dish was still fairly tasty, the star of the dish had to be the chilli sauce used and the vinegar (there's no vinegar on the non-chilli versions although you may add it in yourself on the side).  Firstly? The sauce. It was full of flavour without being overly salty. It had a lot of depth and vinegar was not only fragrant but it added a lot of soul into the dish. I can't quite pin point exactly what made the vinegar so special, but it definitely wasn't any regular black vinegar that was used.  The Noodles The noodles itself was wonderfully cooked. Perfectly al dante, the noodles managed to soak up the delicious sauce yet remain springy and crisp.  The Ingredients While the meatballs were pretty standard, the rest of the items were immaculately cooked. The minced pork had a great fat to meat ratio, the dumplings were very tasty and the liver.... The liver was cooked perfectly. Lightly blanched, the liver was still soft and tender, retaining some pinkish-ness, a wonderful contrast to the normal hard, overcooked and powdery livers a lot of other places offer.  The Soup If you're not a fan of the dried versions, that the soup is worth having a try too! The soup is to die for. Even though it was just a little side bowl, the fact that it was chalky showed how much pork has been cooked in it and it tasted like it too. Definitely the best soup from a noodle shop I've had.  So the big question is...... Are they worthy of that Michelin star? Yes! I'm not shy to say this but this has certainly been THE best Mince Pork Noodle I've had and I'll be happy to queue again to have another round of it... As long as the queue isn't anything more that 30 mins."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,4-Sep-16,"dear sweet fanciful moses this was the best bowl of noodles I've ever had. I normally like the toppings better than noodles in noodle dishes because I'm not a huge carbs person, but I ate an entire large bowl of these. They are perfectly fresh al dente goodness with theeee best flavor to them. I also usually shy away from liver but this tasted.. less... livery? lol. Sorry for the lame description. Much foodie. The dried fish bits were my favorite! Sounds gross but yum I could've eaten a bag of those like chips on their own.  I got in line at 10:50 am on a Sunday and still waited 45 minutes in a line of mayyyybe 20 people. They really take their time and make each bowl perfectly. I would honestly queue up for that long again. It was completely worth it. I'm sure it's only going to get busier as they've been awarded a Michelin star so go early to avoid sweating your ass off in a line all day.  Go for the large $10 bowl. I don't have a huge appetite and I still finished the large bowl fine. If you're gonna queue for that long, go big or go home :)  Went great with a $1.50 iced lemon tea from the stall right next to it!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",2,9-Jan-17,"Lured by a shining Michelin star, we queued up behind 25 minutes of other patrons.  In short, this joint has a lot of hype, it admirably tries to fulfill that hype, but at the end of the day, it's a mom and pop spot serving authentic, cultural noodle dishes on a thin margin.  In long, flavors of their noodle dishes are indeed complex. But almost to a fault. The dry egg noodle dish is very sour with vinegar. The liver assaults your taste buds with iron and minerals. The dumplings are nearly all wrapping skin and what seafood is in them is all but lost.  The soupy rice noodle is a bit better, but the noodles lack al dente texture. The sliced pork is both tough and sans flavor. The ground pork is again tough and relatively bland. The fried fish chip is an interesting flare and provides a bit of seafood complexity to the dish, as does seaweed slivers.  Singapore is an immaculate city, but an interesting practice occurred at this joint: the noodle prep man filled noodles into each of our bowls...but then he stacked our two noodle dishes together such that the dirty side of one dish was on top of the noodles of our other dish. After the top dish touched the soiled countertop, it defied logic why he'd place the dish on top of the other bowl's noodles, but hey, what do I know.  In sum, certainly worth a try, but not all that glitters with Michelin stars is gold."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,17-Oct-17,"Whilst making my research on a trip to Singapore, this food stall caught my eye being rated 1 Star in Michelin Guide 2017 for Singapore, also being ranked No. 1 in the World Street Food Masters List 2017.  I went to the shop at around 10.30 a.m. on a Wednesday. The location isn't quite easy to find as it's kind of hidden at the ground floor eatery of an apartment. When I got there, the queue was about reaching the metal rollers of the shop. And it takes about 35-40 mins before it's my turn to place my order.  Having ordered the medium portion and collected the food, I am amazed by that presentation of food in a rather huge bowl. It's REALLY big!  Taste wise, it's rather obvious that Vinegar plays a big role in the sauce. The pork is cooked to perfection, tender and juicy! The soup/broth served together with seaweed has a strong taste too. It feels like it has been cooked for long hours. I have also ordered an extra bowl of meatballs which tastes really good too!  However so, it's rather regrettable where whilst the food being one so spectacular, it doesn't really stay in my taste buds. It just doesn't make me feel like ""I'll come back one day"".  Note: - Closed on 1st and 3rd Monday of the month. - Queue can get rather long. By the time I've finished my food, at about 11.30 a.m., it is safe to say that the queue has doubled, although it is a Wednesday morning. - Happy Chef Western Food serves pretty decent Chicken Chop too! Do give it a try!  Direction: Take the exit from Lavender Station (East West MRT Line), turn left and walk to the back of Immigration and Checkpoint Authority Building, cross the bridge into the residential areas (apartments) and look for Block 466.  Visited 11 Oct 2017. Food ordered: Pork Noodle (Medium portion, SGD 8.00), add-on Meatball soup (SGD 6.00) - Considering the portion, it feels like it's a little overpriced, but having awarded with a Michelin Star, worth it!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,21-Nov-16,"Woot! Michelin Star food for $6!  Here's a tip, if you go at 8am, you can get a number and have your spot saved in line. Then come back at 9:30 (when they open) and wait for your number to be called.  I had number 23 and my number wasn't called till almost 11. (the stand also primarily speak in Chinese ).  I got the Bak Chor Mee and the soup base is really the most awesome part of the dish. The dish is spicy/tangy so definitely more of an acquired taste for some people."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,10-Jun-19,One of the cheapest Michelin Star food you can get. The meat balls are super delicious! Some times you'll have to Q for an hour to order
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,25-Apr-18,You can write 10-15 Yelp reviews while on queue!  I personally didn't mind the wait and thoroughly enjoyed the noodles after ~1.5hr of waiting. Maybe I was just hungry? I wish I had ordered a larger bowl after waiting for that long.  I'm not sure if I'd be back but it's definitely a place to try out at least once because if its Michelin status.
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",2,9-Mar-18,"Overrated.  Is it significantly better than your average bak chor mee? Yes.  Is a tiny handful of noodles (in a deceptively large bowl) good enough to be worth $6 and 0.5-2 hours of your time? No.  Say an hour of your time is worth only $8. Would you pay $10-22 for this bowl of noodles (if it meant no queueing up)? If not, then what are you doing here?"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,26-Aug-16,"I am definitely a fan of the food, but not the line for it.  Unfortunately, it has gotten even more popular with the Michelin Star, hence it was one hour and forty minutes line up time for my friends.  Perhaps, they can open up a second store somewhere else as I seriously want to go back and have this soon!! X.X"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,30-Sep-16,"I'm of Chiu chow descent so trust me when I tell you I love love love bak chor mee. We came here right before it opened to get a number tag for the cue. We made it about 10 mins before they opened and got #9. The whole wait time was about 20-30 mins. Definitely get there before they open because the line goes out the door the moment the store actually is open for orders. Once the restaurant opens, they take the numbers first and then everyone else in the line.  It was our last meal in Singapore so we definitely went all out. Instead of one $10 bowl, we both got two $5 bowls which meant more food for the price! It's pricier than other hawker stands and other restaurants that serve it. You can taste the difference and it tastes good. I can see why they got a Michelin star. The bowls are small though.  The people there speak little English and mostly mandarin. Ordering was easy though because there aren't too many choices. The bak chor mee dry is definitely the way to go. It's vinegary but not overpowering and the noodles are a perfect texture. I hate soggy noodles so this was a big deal to me. There isn't a lot of meat but most dishes don't come with a lot of meat in south east Asia. We also got the meatball soup! Yummy!  I would definitely come back as long as I could avoid the lines. Definitely go a little earlier, even if it's like 2 minutes. The line gets long, fast!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,29-Mar-15,"singapore is never short of cheap and good food. but when it comes to having awesome nosh, singaporeans will need to scour every single nook and crany for the best. When you feel like chowing down on a good bowl of pork noodle (Bak Chor Mee as we would call it), please come here.  The queue during lunch might be a little daunting, so try to come down during off peak hours but even during off peak, one can expect to wait for about 15 to 20 minutes to see the front of the queue. So don't come famished but almost hungry. :)  Remember the soup nazi from Seinfeld? Well, we do have an experience with the whole ordering process. You will have to order in a particular sequence - price of the bowl you want, type of noodle, dry or soup and then all the misc special request (less spicy, more vinegar, no liver etc). If in a group, please remember to order per bowl. so don't go like ""2 bowls of $5 mee pok, no chill"" - you will be left #ignored.  When your bowl is presented to you, you will be glad you actually waited. the noodles are cooked perfectly with all the quality ingredients one will want in a bowl of bak chor mee. you have the minced pork, the liver slices, the singluar meatball, that lonely piece of vegetable mixed in a crazy sauce that one will relish till the very last drop. Mix them all up and slowly enjoy the goodness in every bite. The accompanying soup is also really flavourful and one can only wonder how their wonton soup will taste like! (till the next time I go back).  So to have some authentic pork noodle, come down here and get an awesome bowl or two! Please invite me along the next time anyone is going down and I will be glad to join you in enjoying an awesome bowl of bak chor mee!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,11-Aug-18,"Famous Michelin-star bak chor mee stall in SG. The noodle here is very flavorful - strong flavors across sweet/salty/sour/spicy which makes the bak chor mee standout. They also give you a lot of sides to accompany the noodle - sliced pork, minced pork, wonton, meatballs, liver, noodle crisps - everything taste excellent and a good balance to the noodle.  Portion is big which probably explains the above average price. Would go back again if in the area. However, while this is a very good bak chor mee, it's probably not good enough to warrant 1 hour+ wait during peak hours"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,10-Feb-18,"Well, it's good, but to come specially for this place - there are so many good eating places in Singapore- so again - I enjoyed my dish - but unless you really coming around 17:00 - when the q is quit short - I wouldn't bother"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,29-Dec-16,We had the Bak Chor Mee. Nice.
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,8-Jun-17,"My friends and I pretty much ordered their entire menu. The wet style noodles were simple, flavorful pork base broth look funn. This same soup was used in the seaweed soup and the meatball soup. The dry style noodles had some spicy, vinegar mixture with yellow flat noodles. The dry style mixture wasn't overpowering amd it was well controlled. Out of all the dishes my favorite was the meatballs, because the juice of the meat seemingly burst as you bite into it, the pork flavors fills your palates as it travels. The only thing is the line is terrible, I personally wouldn't stand in line again."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,8-Dec-17,"This changes your expectations of a Michelin star meal. Firstly you have to be ok waiting for 45 minutes in line. The noodles were good made of all different forms of pork but my favorites was still the basic meatballs. If you look at this as a bowl of noodles in isolation it was ok, what made it special was the effort the noodles seemed to take juxtaposed with the price."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,26-Mar-15,"Like others before me have said, if you can get past waiting in line for 30 mins on average (and upwards of 1hr during peak hours and days), then you're in for a real treat. I ordered the much talked about pork noodles with the broth on the side, and it was absolutely delicious. While I have had noodles of this style elsewhere, I have never tried it with the unique vinegar sauce mixture that the chef so craftily pours over the fresh noodles which are made on site.  All in all, this is a great example of a local gem!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,30-Aug-13,"I've not had vinegary mee pok before. There, I said it. What's with the judgey looks, people? Geez!  So I embarked upon a mee pok trail, and this was one of those die die must tries. We got there slightly before 11am, and a wild queue of 18-20 people greets us. Curses! Still, we duly wait, as dining companion really likes her mee pok. Fast forward about 40mins later, it's finally our turn and we both end up with mee kia as it turns out, while she likes mee pok, the mee pok noodles here are too doughy for her liking. And it's true, even the mee kia seems pudgier than those elsewhere, and these upsized strands have a less QQ bite than I'd prefer. Sad.  Vinegar hit is ok, neither too subtle nor overpowering. The chilli leans towards the mild side, and the ingredients are mostly meaty stuff- one wanton, one meat ball, some minced pork, pork slices and liver. A bit measly, really.  You know the episode where Karl Pilkington goes to China, and when he treks the wall and goes 'it's not a Great wall. It's an alright wall. It's the Alright Wall of China.'? Yup, for me, it's just an alright bowl of noodles. Plus the ridiculous wait.. I think not."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,26-Dec-17,"The Michelin Star wasn't awarded for the late afternoon one hour wait or shabby looking exterior. Endure the wait, though, and you'll get an incredible bowl of Pork noodles. I asked for $10, dry - and it was phenomenal. The noodles were perfectly cooked, supplemented by a refreshing soup. If you can endure the wait - bring water - you'll be rewarded."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,29-Nov-17,"Meh, I thought the noodle was very mediocre and missed any flavor. Not worth it for me."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,8-Aug-13,"According to Teochew Ah Pa, the price has gone up with inflation. Now the smallest bowl is $5 and we ordered 3 bowls of dry BCM, 2 Mee Kia and 1 Mee Pok. The queue is of course, very long as always.  Alas, the much-awaited BCM came up and yes, it was the same old taste that we've had previously. It does not hold back on vinegar and seasonings, and thus give a satisfying kick which lures you back for more.  No pork lard but crispy pieces of flatfish still works for us. My family love our BCM the spicy way but their plain version is equally competent. You can self service to more vinegar if you like.  That said, we noted a problem this time round. Too much sodium in the wanton dumplings and also noodles. I did not remember the food being so heavily seasoned the last time (or my memory must be failing......) But it could also be this distinctive taste or that keeps the business going so well after many years.  Indeed, we got thirsty hours after the meal. But well, once-in-a-blue-moon bowl of comforting and satisfying Bak Chor Mee won't hurt too much."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,29-May-17,"Review for Nov2016 - Queue is long (about 1hr) during the lunch hour, but would definitely come here. Came with a friend and had both variants of the noodles and it was definitely worth the wait and would come back again"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,20-Nov-13,"If you like waiting in line and paying a lot of money for hawker food, this is the place for you. If you don't like waiting in line and paying a lot of money for hawker food, this is still the place for you.  Whenever I'm away from Singapore, I have dreams about this bowl of goodness. Haters can nitpick all they want, but IMMA LET YOU FINISH, BUT THIS IS THE BEST BAK CHOR MEE OF ALL TIME."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,28-Aug-14,"Definitely one of the best Mee Pok I have tasted in Singapore. Nice chewy al dented style of egg noodles mixed in with pork lard, soy sauce and chilli. Definitely worth a bite if you have the time to stand in line for at least 30 minutes"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,6-Jan-14,"AMAZING. i was taken here not knowing what bak chor mee even was, nor what awaited me. my delicate californian constitution could not handle the heat and 1 hour 10 min wait in line to get my food, but damn, was all that worth it! (it helped that i waited in line with 2 lovely ladies). this bak chor mee was delicious. chilli, vinegar, and perfectly QQ noodles! didn't really care about the wonton, but the pork and liver were delicious (although i wish there were more). i can't really compare to other bak chor mee, since i'm a novice, but i know good food, and this was good food."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,12-Dec-15,"Favorite fan of Bak Chor Mee forever. Heard about this no. 1 BC mee and it's snaking queue. Hence tried it today. Ordered a $10 & $6, after queueing for 45mins. Extremely disappointed. Noodles is thick and not so springy. Ingredients are fresh. Base sauce is so so. Overall not really worth the price and time. Doubtful will come and queue again.  Advice to owner is that he should concentrate on cooking instead of also being the cashier. Hence undercooked noodles."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,1-Nov-17,Don't need much review. This place has enough five stars. The first Michelle star pork noodle in the world. So proud that our singapore hawker food made it to the Michelle star. Remains as my top choice if I have the time to queue!
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,9-Nov-18,"So. good. period. I've never had this type of pork noodles before and I'm glad I got to try it! We got there around 1245 on Saturday and there were about 30 people ahead of us. We ended up ordering 1.5 hours later. Everyone says to order bak chor mee but it doesn't say it anywhere on the menu. I'm assuming it is number 3 gan mian and they say ""mee pok"" id also the same thing. I ordered bak chor mee, regular size, dry, with chili. You can watch the crew make your food right in front of you like a fine oiled machine. I'll go home thinking about this bowl of noodles! The salty, sweet, sour flavors of the noodles are perfectly balanced. It comes with a small bowl of seaweed soup. Others ordered some kind of meatball soup to go with the noodles.  I don't think I would wait 1.5 hours again for this 1 michelin start rated food, but the next 20 times I go, I would plan to go when it's not as busy."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,8-Sep-12,"I am not a fan of Bak Chor Mee and I find the Bak Chor Mee here average. But people who love it are queuing an average of 20-30 minutes for the food. From own experience of queuing, I deduced that the wait is long and the queue is slow because the person preparing the the food seem slow..  Further observing the preparation prove I am right but that is because they treat their food seriously. Even though I am not their fan, I have friends around me who are and they make it a point to go all the way to Larvender MRT to have it.  Those who are interested can try for themselves and they are open most of the days from 9.30am to 9pm except 1st and 3rd Monday of each month."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,25-Aug-16,"Its a one michelin star place.. went there with high expectations. The line wasn't too bad as compared to the previous two famous carts I'd been to. I just didn't like the noodles, the texture and taste is something I just didn't enjoy. That being said, you should still give it a try, I'm pretty sure most people standing in line really enjoyed it."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",2,6-Jun-19,Line may seem long but only because the chef takes so long to make each bowl. I personally waited almost two hours and the dish wasn't exceptional or anything I hadn't tasted before. Many other better options nearby but significantly less wait!
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,14-Sep-12,"Nothing else is comparable to the noodles here. This is evidenced by the long lines every day, and I do mean every day! We were there at 10.30am on a wednesday and there is a line of 10 persons! Once we joined the line, 5 more were behind us immediately!  Tip: morning is cooked by the boss himself, lunch hour his ""sous-chef"", dinner another worker. I only go when it is either the boss himself or the sous-chef. It is all in the number of nano-seconds the noodle is cooked! Yes, technicalities of Asian hawker food!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,6-Dec-13,"Each time I think of Bak Chor Mee, I dutifully make my way down to this stall to get my fix.  Springy noodles cooked al dente style (chinese version) with lots of tasty tiiny meat chunks, meat balls, salted fish tossed in a delicious blend of vinegar, chilli, soya sauce and oil!  There's liver too but I always opt out of that.  Best ever - not two thumbs up but 10 fingers up!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,31-Mar-16,"As a tourist from the US who generally likes Asian noodle dishes I was intrigued by the favorable reviews of this eatery. And as it was with in walking distance from my hotel I decided to track down this establishment. What I found was a small hawker stall just off North Bridge road (about a 1/4 mile NE of Raffles) that, in the middle of the afternoon, had a queue. No other stall I passed along the way had anyone waiting that time of day. The queue was a very promising sign.  It was fortunate that I had written down ""bak chor mee"" (even though I had no idea what this means beyond being a noodle dish -- I was being adventuresome), because there is no menu anywhere and the brusque but hard working staff doesn't seem to understand much English. Upon my placing the order phonetically, the man asked ,me a question I didn't understand. I guessed that he wanted to know if I wanted chili sauce on my noodles. I nodded.  My bowl of noodles indeed came with the chili sauce and was garnished with several types of pork -- shredded, sliced, and some pieces of liver-- together with few other items I couldn't identify. I was extremely pleased with the noodles which were very tasty, although I might have backed off a little on the chili sauce as a personal preference ( just for reference: I like my salsas between mild and medium). A bowl of soup accompanied the noodles, a flavorful (seaweed?) both that had a little aftertaste of liver. Overall the very savory noodles made tracking down this little hawker stall well worthwhile."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,16-Aug-12,"This stall was previously located in Marina Sq Food Court and always has a long queue for the bak chor mee. Even foreigners that come here want to try the noodles before they return to their countries.  The special feature is the Chilli sauce and the flavourful soup! Their pig's liver is also done very nicely. Cooked for just the right amount of time, resulting is tender slices of liver heaven. I was sort of shocked when i saw that the whole bowl was filled with oil, but i was told that this is actually the yardstick for all Bak Chor Mees in Singapore. Anyway, i was not disappointed with the taste, not too salty and very flavourful with just a highlight of sourness coming from the vinegar.  I also liked the fried bits of lard and the liver bits, which wasn't too overpowering and given in the correct amount. The crispy fish was also a nice addition to the usual bak chor mee dish. A must try."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,28-Oct-16,"Queued for approximately an hour and a half a week after the Michelin announcement.  I came with a huge expectation and, to be perfectly honest, was left pretty disappointed by the dish. Although the noodle base was undoubtedly unique, I found the noodle and other ingredients very normal and forgettable. Then again, I do admit that I have never been a fan of Bak Chor Mee.  This stall (barely) deserves its one star due to its incredible noodle base; however, I will probably not come back anytime soon."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,27-Apr-18,China style noodles! Definitely order a large bowl. You have to wait a long time so might as well eat more. :)
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,24-Aug-16,"Undoubtably the best bak chor mee in Singapore, I was a regular customer since before it got its star, the noodles are cooked per bowl by the shi fu, the noodles are always cooked just right, not too hard, not too soft but the real key is the sauce/broth base which is tangy and just so good, many places in Singapore don't have a flavour nearly as strong and delicious as their base. Each bowl comes with a lovely soup with liver, pork and meatballs inside but I'd recommend ordering an extra bowl of meatballs in soup, you really won't regret it.  It's a shame the waiting time as grown even longer since it has won its (well-deserved) michelin star so I don't go as often but when I have the time, I'd gladly wait double the time for a bowl of these noodles."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,30-Mar-18,"So this place received a gazillion accolades Michelin star being one among them. Expect lineups at 4PM as well, you've 3 dishes to choose from, but overall didn't care too much for mine, just walked away from mine after eating 2/3rds of it. But at these provrsx(10$ and under) worth the try if line up isn't too long."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,28-Jan-17,"not quite sure that this hawker stand lived up to the 1-michelin star hype in my book...me and justin b. showed up on a tuesday afternoon around 2pm hoping to catch the in between lunch/dinner lull, but i guess everyone else had the same idea b/c the line was at least 30-40 people deep when we showed up. the line moves so slow and its kind of a bummer there's no limit to the amount of food that 1 person can order so you may see a single person ahead of you that buys like 6 bowls of food and with the hot/humid singapore weather and only a few fans in the area to cool you down...waiting in line is not a fun experience haha. the only redeeming thing is that there is a drink stand next door where you can get a cold soda to help cool down or order food from the other stalls to satisfy your hunger pains haha...  we ended up waiting 2 hours for our bowl of food :( upon first bite of the bak chor mee, i wasnt immediately wow-ed. the whole sweet/sour/tangy flavor combination isnt my favorite...but as i continued to eat, my bowl of noodles, pork, dumplings, and fish balls grew on me and i liked the flavors more and more with each bite. i think we ordered the $8 SGD bowl which is about $5ish USD and for that price point, its still a great deal and value. i had never had bak chor mee before this experience and i'm glad i got to experience this dish while in singapore...but i cannot justify this 2-hour wait."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,25-Feb-18,"Had a similar Pork noodle 20 years ago when I was in singapore and thought wanna try one this time during my formula one visit. Friend recommended to me this Michelin one star rated noodle shop. Expected to wait for an hour but guess what, we have waited for 2 full hours for this noodles! The noodle itself was very good but definitely I will never wait this long again for this!!!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,18-Oct-14,"When my wife asked me why I did not heed the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate recommendation to ""limit refined grains"", I answered, ""It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every bowl of bak chor mee that comes from the coffee shop on Crawford Lane.'""  I had to put it down in writing on Yelp before I could order my extra large bowl of bak chor mee."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,27-Oct-13,"The best minced pork noodle in Singapore. The noodle is cooked just al dente ..... most other hawkers in Singapore tend to over-cook their noodles but not this chap. The morsels of meat are also cooked just right, tender, juicy and succulent. This just shows to me that a lot of attention to detail has gone into cooking that bowl of noodle.  Expensive for a bowl of hawker noodle but well worth the price. The only pet peeve I have for this place is the long wait. Budget for at least an hour of queuing. Is it worth the wait ..... hmm, the jury is still out as I really dislike having to stand in line and wait for my food.  But, if you want to try the best ""bak chor mee"" in Singapore, this is the place!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",2,29-May-15,"A lot of newspapers, articles, etc about this place. One ridiculous article i found was posted right in front of the cashier, which says about two men fighting due to the queuing and police came to reconcile. waited for 20 mins, they normally had one lady take your order first and then the old man cooking. he used many bowls by putting some little meat, soup in every bowl and then dump to another place. he never ended up using that same bowl for serving. i really had no idea what he was doing.  all the meat like pork and pork liver were raw. he basically just put the soup in it so it cooked by itself.  the noodles are quite normal, the soup bowl on the side was very fatty and oily, the flavor is just vinegar plus spicy sauce. i don't see why it is so famous or special."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,25-May-19,Chef is like a mad scientist. Best noodle dish I've ever had and worth the 45 min wait. I want to go back to Singapore just to eat there.
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,9-Aug-13,"First things first, the queue is VERY LONG. And it's not those fast moving queue, so you do need quite a bit of patience if you want to get a taste of this bar chor mee!  My friend told me that the 'dry' one is what people think is the better one, so I tried it. But in my humble opinion, the soup one actually taste better overall.  Nothing very spectacular in my opinion, so I'm not very sure if I'll come back, especially with such a long queue............."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",2,26-Aug-12,"This is so underwhelming.  I can't believe I queued 40 minutes for this during lunch time! It was time to see what's the fuss about when I decided to join the snaking queue in this coffeeshop tucked away in a sleepy estate of Crawford Lane.  All I can say is I don't see what is so special about it. Add in the waiting time and I feel cheated. The noodles were quite stiff and starchy, and there was so much sole fish in it and too little minced pork.  I had a better time with the homemade iced lemon tea from the same coffeeshop - be sure to order that if you need to try the noodles!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,7-Sep-15,"Tiny hawker stand with only three items on their menu. Heard the line can get crazy. We went around 3 hoping no one would be there but still had to wait about 10-15 mins. Not bad. They have a dry noodle, a soup noodle and a beef ball soup. My husband got the dry noodle and I got the soup noodle. It is interesting how you pick a size by $ amount and not small medium or large. Every stands in line on the left where you pick up food and the guy will call you up to the right side to place your order. My husband loved his dry noodle. My soup noodle was just so so. Dry noodle definitely tasted a lot better. I would never wait an hour for the soup noodle."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,31-Jul-14,"Totally worth the wait and everytime I've been here, there will definitely be a wait.  The crispy fried flatfish is what makes all TW difference for this bcm.  Order a bowl of too soft but nonetheless tasty dumpling soup to round off your meal after all that waiting!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",2,20-Feb-17,"It must be a good day for me as I didn't have to Q for a long time. I think the noodle used to be better, now, it's simply too overrated. I have tasted better and hope Tai Hwa will return to the standard it used to have when it was at Hill Street."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,8-Jan-13,"Delicious minced meat noodles, but on the pricey side, starts from $5 to $10 a bowl. Not sure what lies in the $10 bowl but taste wise, it hits the BCM spot all the time. Long queues expected but moderately fast."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,4-Dec-12,"Delicious minced meat noodles, love e vinegar taste and the liver was cook very well. However for the long queue, might not have the patience to wait."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,4-Aug-12,"Not sure what else I can say other than that this is most definitely the best Bak Chor Mee in Singapore.  Once you can get past the queue in this little kopitiam, you'll finally find yourself holding onto a bowl of the most perfectly cooked noodles, doused in a casually good vinegar base. One of the best parts of this is how well cooked their minced and sliced pork is - soo tender and juicy considering how fine they are. The pork balls are also very tasty without having that artificial flavour to it, and to crown it off, they add some bits of crispy deep fried dried fish, which adds that bit of crunch and saltiness to the whole bowl. One wonders why this doesn't feature in more minced pork noodles sold everywhere because it makes such a good combination!  The soup on the side is so well brewed as well, you can actually taste the pork from which the flavour comes from. None of that artificial flavouring that we frown upon, I don't think!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",3,16-Oct-13,"I'd known before making my way down to Lavender that Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles was a popular bak chor mee stall, with some food bloggers going so far as to claim that it was the best bak chor mee stall in Singapore. I was all ready to give it the benefit of the doubt, seeing as how it was a family-run stall dating back to 1932. Despite the knowledge of all these facts its snaking queue on a Wednesday evening managed to surprise me anyway, and contributed to the already high expectations that I'd had of the noodles here.  Um sadly. Wasn't impressed.  I kind of get why Hill Street Tai Hwa Pork Noodles has its loyal following. The gravy here has a much higher ratio of vinegar than most bak chor mees do, which I suppose goes down well with those who like their noodles with an acidic kick. The fragrant and crisp pieces of ti por or fried solefish provided a nice crunch that provided a pleasant contrast with the springy mee kia (thin noodles), and the pork used here in all its forms - minced, sliced, livers and balls - is fresh, chewy and of good quality. Oh, the one thing that I liked about the bak chor mee here was the broth that came with it. I could literally see a meat cloud in it, which was a precursor to how intensely meaty and flavorful it tasted.  I'm going to go all out blasphemous and say that I don't get the hype about the bak chor mee here. At all. This was okay bak chor mee, yes - but to call it the best bak chor mee in Singapore when I can't even decide if I prefer it to the ones sold by the hawkers in my neighbourhood? Nahhh, I'll take convenience any day.  Just a note of caution if you're thinking of heading here for bak chor mee: They're supposed to close at 9 pm, but their actual closing time is when they run out of ingredients for the day, which, on the day I visited, was 7.30 pm."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,24-Jan-14,"A really unassuming establishment until you see how popular it is by the line that forms. Tai Hwa isn't a popular hawker center like Newton's or Maxwell's but it is really a gem!  When I first got my bowl, I was thinking ""this is it for $6?"" but it really is a small bowl of quality goodness. Every single item is thoughtfully crafted and placed as an integral part of a whole. Their preparation is arguably inefficient; however, you won't argue any longer once you eat it!  Always get the pork noodles, dry. It sits in a small pool of vinegar-based sauce and the noodles are FRESH. As in, they are handmade (at least that's what it seems) and cooked upon order. Topping the noodles are a mixture of minced pork, liver, dry fried fish, etc. You get a bowl of soup on the side as well.  I saw some other people with bigger portions so you can probably get there for extra $$ if you're feeling hungrier or want more goodness."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,4-Jun-15,"I have lived away for some 12 years and every time i come backto Singapore, which is about twice a year, i head straight here, the morning after my arrival, for my fav authentic hawker food. Each time, the noodles do not disappoint. The secret is in the mix: the sacue is sufficiently vinegary and sweet and sallty, the ingredients are fresh and of good quality, and the noodles are always cooked just right. What really seals the deal for me is the stock which is amazing, Over the years the prices have escalated so that my visit each time runs up a bill close to $50, for two persons eating there and a to go order for three at home. Notwithstanding the prohibitive cost I return. MY one complaint right now is that for to go orders, they do not offer you the soup sp you have to purchase a soup bowl to go!"
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,15-Oct-14,"The best minced pork noodle I have ever had. Other minced pork noodles no longer satisfy my cravings anymore since I have had this many years ago. Today, the noodles still taste as good as it was in the past. Love the fried flatfish and the wanton that comes with it."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,13-Jan-16,"Hands down the best Bak Chor Mee in Singapore. When it comes to flavor and freshness, Tai Hwa is hard to beat. Some people prefer their Bak Chor Mee to incorporate tomato based sauce, but my tastes are more aligned to the vinegar / chili heavy mix that Tai Hwa cooks up. The wontons, liver, meatballs and dried salted fish give the extra ""oomph"" that make the noodles truly a complete dish."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,24-Aug-14,"Fave bcm in town! but be prepared to queue for this, usually it will take me around 30-45 mins depending on the length of the queue and how many orders per person."
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,10-Mar-13,Hands down the best bak chor mee in Singapore! I love the vinegar with the chilli and so much porky goodness in the soup! Super long queue so make sure you bring some entertainment! Wait times can be up to one hour at peak times.
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",5,11-Apr-14,I accidentally found this place. I had a pork noodle. The portion of food is quite too big for a girl like me. The taste is unique and delicious. Love it!!
Tai Hwa Pork Noodle,4.1,96,"Chinese, Noodles",4,21-May-14,Be prepared to queue. It is worth it. Is there a better pork noodle out there? Nope there never will be
Food Republic,4,1,Food Court,4,27-May-16,"Very nicely decorated food court.  To even call this a food court is probably an understatement. This is nicer then a food court. The food is prepared in a nice ambiance, self served or collected with a beeper.  Food quality can be disputed depending whether if you are comparing with a normal food court or a food cafe/restaurant type. It probably stands in between for value and quality."
Lighthouse Bistro,5,1,Bistros,5,15-Dec-18,"Got recommendation from a friend to try this place out, and I'm just amazed with the quality of food in a cosy comfortable ambience, all of that at reasonable prices. The lobster noodle is incredibly tasty, featuring not only a juicy yummy piece of lobster but also blended perfectly with salmon roe topping. The seafood fried rice is very very fragrant and mixed with fresh pieces of squid, prawns and mussels. The prawn bisque is super yummy as thick prawnish broth topped up with a delicious piece of prawn cake. Last but certainly not least, dessert with the pisang island, banana blended with brownie pastry doused with chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream, which was a perfect conclusion to the meal. Such great quality food at affordable prices, 20+ on the average for a main course and 15% off if you are a ntuc union member!"
The Malayan Council,4.9,11,Cafes,5,15-Jun-24,"Wow their cakes are so delicious, some of the best I've tried in singapore, the cake is light and fluffy, the cream is not too airy, and not too dense and the flavor is true to its name for the two cakes we got.  Their drinks is so refreshing for a place like Singapore where it's just constantly hot the mint and fruit really makes a difference to one's mood when they've been beaten by the heat and humidity of Singapores climate.  The ambiance was very nice and clean inside, it looks like a cute place to eat even though we were mainly here for dessert.  The server here was super also very sweet and even gave us a small gift before leaving!  Food drink and service quality was all top notch 100% would come back If I ever come back to Singapore"
The Malayan Council,4.9,11,Cafes,5,15-Feb-24,"A true 5 star restaurant in the city of Singapore. The ambiance is fantastic, and the wait staff gave some of the best service I have had at any restaurant anywhere in a long time.  The servers were funny and interactive, brought cake out to our table (which was a pretty big group) and made sure we were well cared for.  The food was amazing as well everything everyone in our party ate was wonderful.  The cost is high, but given the service and quality of the food I would say it is worth it. Maybe not all the time but definitely on special occasions."
The Malayan Council,4.9,11,Cafes,5,16-Jun-24,"The food was so amazing. Staff were very friendly, attentive and helpful. The ambience was cozy and excellent. It was one of our best experience."
The Malayan Council,4.9,11,Cafes,5,10-Feb-22,Loved everything we had here. From appetizers to deserts. The portions are huge so it's good for share. Ordered 4 dishes for 5 and were stuffed. Amazing flavors for very different dishes. Loved it.
The Malayan Council,4.9,11,Cafes,5,25-Nov-17,"Started my meal with the Malayan Wings, a spicy (just right) starter. Six wings is a meal, so pace yourself. The wings were a juice delight. My main course was the Smoked Duck Chili Padi. Another spicy selection, done at a perfect level of hotness for me. The linguini was cooked to nice firmness and flavor. The Lychee Mint Cooler was a perfect beverage to go with this meal. The service was exceptional, friendly and smooth.  I finished a wonderful meal with an over the top delicious piece of Durian Pengat cake. Yes durian, if you are lucky enough to enjoy this fruit, you are in for a sweet treat. And if durian is not for you, not to worry, you find a flavor to you taste inthe amazing selection of cakes!  I highly recommended The Malayan Coumcil for at least one of you meals while in Singapore!"
The Malayan Council,4.9,11,Cafes,5,22-Jun-19,"This is my second visit here. The first time I went, I was just blown away by the durian pengat cake. So soft and light, smothered with the best durian filling with just the right amount of sweetness. Had to take my sister here when she visited Singapore as I had been raving about that cake. We got a complimentary ondeh-ondeh cake when we were dining, and that cake did not disappoint. We had initially thought that the 2 cakes were too much for us to finish, but we were so wrong. Those were some of the most delicious cakes we have ever had.. Worth every calorie (if you are counting)!"
The Malayan Council,4.9,11,Cafes,5,10-Apr-19,The Oreo milkshake was delicious and the food was great for its price. We even got 2 free cake slices for my birthday ! The people who work there were very nice. This is a great place.
The Malayan Council,4.9,11,Cafes,5,14-Jan-18,"I wanted to say thank you again to your shop and all of your staff. Literally, some of the best customer service in Singapore! Everyone was extremely friendly and welcoming. The food and cakes are amazing, and we will definitely return! FYI - The ondeh ondeh cake is the best that we have tried...seriously!"
The Malayan Council,4.9,11,Cafes,5,9-May-18,"This has been an amazing experience!!! I was a little hesitant in the beginning as I was looking for really authentic food, but the amazingly friendly staff reassured me to stay! Best decision of the last days. The Laksa was out of this world... ... and the cake I tried the next day : OMG"
The Malayan Council,4.9,11,Cafes,5,6-Jan-17,I've had brunch there once and enjoyed the salted egg crab pasta the most. Portions are huge so I'd advise sharing so you'll have room for dessert... Like their ondeh ondeh cake! I loved it so much I ordered some for my mum's and aunt's birthday. We had some snafus with the delivery service initially but Hafiz was quick to rectify and mistakes and provide a solution. TMC can count on me as a repeat customer!
The Malayan Council,4.9,11,Cafes,4,19-May-18,Having ondeh ondeh cake. Looks good. Cafe ambiance nice. The cakes here do look good. Did not have a chance to try the mains though. But will return to this interesting little cafe.
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,3,1-May-24,"KEK was highly recommended by reviews and we made a reservation to ensure we get a table. It's definitely more of a local spot, it's a covered outdoor dining, reminds me of Dai Pai Dong's in HK which is cool cuz that means the food will be fire!  The food was overall just OK. I mean, it was our 4th night eating in Singapore so the food could be seen as repetitive. We got their Chili Crab (it's ok, we liked Red House better!), coffee ribs (this is a NO! Over fried and weird combo flavor), Fried Garlic Chicken (tad bit too dry...), Yam Nest (aka Taro Nest was pretty good), steamed fish (not good! Didn't taste like a fresh fish... very disappointed), and finally Garlic Kang Kong (Ong Choy stir fry in garlic - over with Sambal!). I think if it was cooler temp, perhaps we could enjoy the food better but we were hot, sticky and the food didn't wow us in any way.  The service was ok, the server didn't push on anything expensive, perhaps bc we knew what we wanted to order. And we did order a few pricey items already for a group of 4 adults and 2 kids. Total bill about $212 USD.  Pro Tip: They do charge for everything on the table, including those wet wipes! So bring your own wipes and tissues! Tell them you don't need it. Also, there's no tap water... so bring your own water and order something with ice. lol"
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,3-Mar-24,"cant really go wrong with KEK. the food is delicious - we ordered the chili crab meat with mantou, coffee ribs, spinach and drunken prawns for dinner last night. service was prompt even though it was super crowded.  ambiance's casual"
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,24-Jan-24,"cant really go wrong at keng eng kee (KEK), alexandra village. the food is usually good and not too pricy. we ordered curry fish head, some vege, claypot liver, cereal prawn & tofu to share. the claypot liver and cereal prawns are my go-to while trying curry fish head for the first time. all of us (from penang) prefer the assam pedas style for curry fish head but the version here is the thick curry broth with coconut milk. still good just a tad heavy. . always good to be back at kek! service is efficient and prompt and the 'cooling' weather makes it all bearable sitting and eating by the hdb walkway.  ambiance's casual."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,27-Nov-22,"fantastic dinner at KEK, Alexandra last night. we had chili crab, cereal prawn, liver, venison, crispy prawn rolls , yu tiao, vege and THE famous moonlight hor fun. all delicious!"
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,5,2-Mar-24,"Feels like a hawker center, but it's a restaurant that takes reservations, etc.  The fish head curry was the most delicious curry I've had in a lifetime of enjoying curries. Huge serving, too. Next to us a family of 4 ordered it and just rice and vegetable for dinner.  Cereal shrimp were simply terrific. The cereal seemed a bit like cornflakes; the shrimp were large and firm and lovely taste. The flavors unexpectedly merged and yum.  The bee hoon (thin rice noodles) was just perfectly done. It's a dish that's easy to muddle. This is how it is supposed to be."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,23-Sep-23,"Classic Singaporean zichar fare for an affordable price. We got a spread of disassembled chili crab, horfun, salted egg squid, coffee pork ribs, prawn paste chicken, cereal prawn, and stir fried kailan -- all for ~$30/person in a group of six, drinks included. Service is what you would expect from a typical Singaporean establishment too: quick, efficient, no nonsense, and mostly spoken in mandarin.  Despite the spread, the food itself was ok and I've had better zichar elsewhere. The cereal jumbo prawns were my favorite, as the prawns were very juicy and fresh. But, the salted egg squid was dry and we regretted not getting the whole chili crab instead."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,2-Mar-24,"This was my favorite restaurant so far during my 2 days in Singapore! We ordered the Chilli Crab, Signature Moonlight Horfun, Claypot Beancurd with Sea Cucumber, Chinese Spinach, and Buns. Everything was seeped in flavor... and I actually loved everything besides the Chilli Crab. I didn't think the crab had too much meat, which was a bit of a bummer."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,1,30-Oct-22,"The service lady is very rude & calculative when taking order, telling even kids drinks tea they charged $ 2 per head & even water they charge this us outrageous. Food portions are small , especially the fried paste chicken. Frankly I won't go again , the other block 125 is better, don't charge plain water at all."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,14-Dec-18,"Okay restaurant. They have indoor seating, but you need to make reservations. Otherwise, they seat you outside.  1. Sweet and Sour Pork (Gu Lao Rou) 20 SGD 2. Black Pepper Beef 20 SGD 3. Eggplant 15 SGD 4. Gan Niu Rou He noodles 9 SGD (great deal, moderately tasty) *5. Calamari in salted egg 28 SGD, best item on the menu  Barley Tea (no barley flavor, super sugary, wouldn't order again).  You know, I thought I didn't like this place, but I've been thinking about their calamari in salted egg ever since I got home. My memory has really improved with time."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,2-Jun-19,"I recently visited Singapore for the 1st time. Prior to my visit I happened to watch the Netflix show ""Street Food."" Watching the show really got me excited about eating in Singapore. Little did I know that my friends in Singapore frequent this establishment and know the owners. They brought us here for lunch. Although the show highlighted their specialty of Chili Crab we did not order it (because we had Chili Crab for dinner the night before). However they selected their other favorite dishes. A few of the favs being Beef Hor Fun (with Egg), Crispy Fried Fish Skins, Salted Egg Shrimp, Seafood Fried Rice & Ming Zhu Rolls.  The food was flavorful & tasty. Dishes came out quick & service was good. Large outdoor dining area & smaller indoor (AC) dining area next to the outdoor area. According to my friends it can get very busy especially during dinner time. Best of all I got a picture with the father and one of the sons featured on the show! Approximate 20 minute walk from the Queenstown MRT station."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,3,20-May-19,"Saw this place featured on Netflix's street food special - decided to check it out while we're in Singapore. It was a bit of a letdown. The chili crab sauce was far too sweet and not spicy enough. It is however, half the price of Jumbo, No Signboard and Longbeach so there's that. But if you're there to eat the chili crab, be warned! Also, you'll need to take a Grab or taxi to get here (or at least a Grab to get back out) as this far from city center and there's no convenient MRT line nearby."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,26-Sep-16,"I've heard lots of good things about Keng Eng Kee (KEK) Seafood in Bukit Merah and decided to give it a try along with a family birthday celebration. It was easy to make a phone reservation just a day before, but do call earlier if you have firmed up plans, to ensure air-con availability.  1. Salted Egg Crab $70/kg *highly recommended* Crabs seem to command better prices that rare minerals like gold or diamonds! It was just 2 years ago when 1kg of crabs cost $50, but nevertheless, these Indian crabs are fleshy. The salted egg sauce was so good, you know it's real salted egg and not the powered artificial salted egg, due to the graininess of the sauce. Not to mention, the taste. Sadly, KEK does no serve fried mantous, only the steamed mantous at $1 per piece. In the background of this photo, you can see 2 mantous, they're pretty big but I would still prefer to dip fried mantous into the sauce. The crab tasted reasonably fresh, but I felt that the chef had fried the crab for too long, resulting in the meat being stuck to parts of the shell.  2. Ming Zhu Roll *highly recommended* This mingzhu roll is definitely a worthy cause to visit KEK. With salted egg right in the middle, this is so pretty and yet delicious. This dish came straight to our table within 2 minutes of ordering. I was confused if this order belonged to another table, but the staff insisted it was for us. The batter is light and crispy. The mushrooms were juicy and added alot of flavour.  3. Fried Hor Fun $5/$8 *highly recommended* Probably their number 1 seller is their fried hor fun. Served with a raw egg. This dish is one of a kind, the wok hei can be subtly picked up by you sense of smell, but the taste of the wok hei is so vivid to your tastebud! The egg helps to make the hor fun wet, and when we ordered both a $5 and a $8 portion, we felt that they gave the same amount of ingredients, with 1 egg in each dish. Maybe they gave us more noodles, but we couldn't see the difference. There's prawns, lup cheong (chinese sausage), squids and some slices of fish mixed into the delicious and fragrant fried hor fun. I definitely want to come back to KEK seafood for this!  4. Fried Prawn Paste Chicken A family favourite that we usually order at every zi char, tasted rather ordinary here at KEK. The pieces were quite small and wasn't quite what we expected since the other dishes had set our expectations much higher. Skip this and also skip the hot plate tofu, it was bland and a waste of $10.  5. Coffee Pork Ribs *highly recommended* The coffee pork ribs were so addictive. The meat was boneless and tender. The coffee sauce wasn't too sweet or over powering. The meat had a tad sweetness and chewiness in every bite. The coffee sauce was the bomb!  Overall : A great place for a family meal. It cost us $180 including drinks for 7 adults."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,5,13-Nov-18,"This was definitely one of the highlight of recent trip - everything was good. Chili crab, blacked pepper crab, noodle, beef...list goes on. It's outdoor table type place more of hawker and doesn't break your bank. Waiter was very friendly and took great care of us. There's also a taxi stand and parking lot, very convenient to get around."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,5,23-May-18,"This is where the locals go and it is amazing! There are long lines especially on weekends but it's worth it. I tried their chili crab, a few vegetable dishes, butter cereal prawn, fried rice, and noodles. everything was very good but BUTTER CEREAL PRAWN. TO DIE FOR.  Please get it if you are going to keng eng kee. YOU WILL NOT REGRET :p"
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,5,27-Sep-18,"Keng Eng Kee Seafood was recommended by a local. We were fortunate to have gotten a table at the air conditioned section.  Food was great including The black Pepper Crab and the Egg Yolk flavored Crab.  A Spinach dish with Duck Egg Yolk was delicious.  My eye opener for this meal is the Cereal Shrimp. Crunchy, Toasty, Umami cereal covering a generous sized Shrimp. After all the Shrimp was eaten, the Cereal was delicious eaten by itself. At the suggestion of my friend, I ate some more of the Cereal with the sauce that was used to flavor the Egg Yolk flavored Crab. A singular great taste treat.  Great local place with fair prices."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,3,6-May-19,"Quite disappointing to be honest. We had some of the signature dishes from this popular neighborhood zi char and everything was average to below average.  We had the crab, coffee ribs, mingzhu, and veggie. - Crab: average - definitely have had many better ones in Singapore - Coffee ribs: ok but a bit too sweet - Mingzhu: too dry for our taste - Veggie: too salty  Overall, quite an affordable place for local seafood but wouldn't really recommend if you want super tasty food"
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,5,11-Apr-18,"Dude! First off we went here for the famous Singapore Chili Crab but the Black Pepper Crab stole the show! It was fantastic! First off, It was HUGE and the flavor was amazing. We had some other dishes as well but I can't remember what they were because of how good the crab was. A friend of mine who is a chef working in Singapore took us around to the places he thought were the best and this place did not disappoint. The owner and his son even came out with a bottle of Remy (not on the menu) and took a couple of shots with us. After the shots they left the bottle for us to enjoy at our leisure. Talk about excellent customer service! I was a little under the weather but still enjoyed myself. I' love to go back healthy with an empty stomach!  Not so humbly submitted, Michael C."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,11-Nov-15,"I came to KEK once several years ago without realizing how big of a following this restaurant has. In a typical coffeeshop setting, it didn't look anymore impressive than any other tze char stall. However, one of my friends had told me KEK was one of his favourite ""go to"" tze char so I made a point to revisit. This time around, with my family to celebrate a birthday. Alas, 3 days before the actual event, we couldn't book the aircon rooms. But luckily for us, it was a cool night and it was fine sitting outdoors.  We ordered quite a bit of their popular dishes - chili crab with mantou, salted egg yolk crab, 3-egg spinach, prawn paste chicken, mixed platter of fried appetizers, coffee ribs, moonlight horfun.  Most impressive was the moon light hor fun HANDS DOWN. $8 for a medium portion gave us a large plate enough for 6 full bowls or 7 slightly less-full bowls. The horfun was full of wok hei, full of lardy flavouring agents like lard cubes, lap cheong and seafood (fish slices, prawns and squid rings). Was very very satisfying and luckily we didn't have extras for I would have walloped them all (bad for waistline!).  The rest of the food was good but nothing extraordinary. The biggest let down was the famed salted egg yolk crab. The sauce was paltry, but most importantly, the crab was overcooked and the meat stuck onto the crab :( The chili crab fared better. While not particularly impressive, the sauce was eggy and morish enough to down a couple of pillow soft flower twist mantou (these deserves a highlight - they were so soft!). Note there is no fried mantous here. All these dishes for merely $207 with change! We even had leftovers to pack up."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,2-Feb-16,"We went on a night before CNY and the Coffeeshop was jammed packed with tables all within and all around the Coffeeshop.  Lucky I called to reserve 2 tables for my family, else I don't think you can walk in with seats for us 17 pax.  We ordered many dishes and mostly, they were good! All flavours were a little on the salty side but all enjoyable!  Dishes that are great: Moonlight Horfun -"
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,22-Oct-12,"affectionately known as KEK.  the parking can be a nightmare but with the improved ERP parking system, it seems easier to get a lot. be careful not to park in the red lots though, they look tempting but are only reserved for season parking.  reservations these days is essential especially on weekends. else be prepared to eat closer to 9pm where the crowd tide ebbs.  of course i will always prefer the air con comfort of their shop house unit. the toilets in there are also way cleaner . alternatively, their outdoor seating is very spacious, as they take up the entire coffee shop at night and is cooling enough with awning and fans strategically located.  the ambiance is that of a zi char place and service was fast in general. especially in relation to the number of people waiting to be fed.  i was a guest, so left all the ordering to the in-the-know regulars here.  first up was the yuen choy(spinach like) in superior broth and the winner was the generous amounts of crispy tasty ikan bilis embellished on it.  next was the deep fried tofu topped with a minced pork saucy mixture with chye po(preserved veg) and chilli. the entire slab of of tofu has a nice golden brown hue, a smooth silky white finish together with a complexity in taste from the minced mixture. another winner.  their signature ming zhu rolls was next. crispy bean curd skin stuffed with salted egg, ham, prawns and lots of mushrooms served with a sweet mayo dip. the ratio of mushrooms needs to be toned down in order not to drown out the rest of the ingredients.  simple quick fried nai bai in garlic is always a hit with me.  the white rice they served was sadly, overly wet and mushy. good thing i'm not a fan of this carbo evil.  the seafood fried rice however was much better. i guess they used the drier overnight rice for this. individual tasty morsels of wok hei coated goodness.  the marmite pork was ok but i prefer marmite chicken better.  then suddenly it was as if our meal ended. all the dishes headed our way, always landed on the tables to the left and right of us. it was like an intermission at an exciting play, unwelcomed and ill timed. a regular was eventually send to check and magically regular service was back.  the clay pot liver was a hit with me. not too many do it well. i hate them overcooked but they taste evil if uncooked. shallots, spring onions, thinly sliced ginger and black sauce complimented the liver slivers.  lastly, two types of crabs completed our feast. both crabs were very well cooked. the flesh firm and sweet. the temperature control of the wok heat was perfect. both the black pepper and the salted egg yolk sauces were just the right consistency. neither too dry nor too wet. and evenly coated through and through. there's no other way to eat crabs except getting your hands dirty and the crabs here are definitely worth your effort. additionally, the claws were nicely cracked giving you quicker access to it's plump flesh.  no finger bowls but the tap and soap method is available."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,17-Aug-12,"Keng Eng Kee (Kek) is a tze char store tucked in the Alexandra Village which have both aircon and non aircon dining area. The aircon dining gets snaps up first so be sure to make reservation.  The food is reasonably priced and the dishes are above average. There are some hit and miss on the dishes here but one of the must try would be the chef special ""Mingzhu Roll"". It is deep-fried bean curd bag stuffed with a rich assortment of ingredients like prawns, salted egg york, ham and parsley. This dish is the store speciality and you can't find it elsewhere."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,3,12-Sep-17,The only dish that really was a hit for us was their signature noodles. The fried eggyolk fish skin was good too. But the real reason for us be here was the eggyolk crabs. Unfortunately they were way to eggy and by the 2nd shot at eating you already feel overwhelmed and choked up. Also their signature fried tofu we just simply did not get what the fuss is about and did not even finish it. All in all ok but i would not drive 28km RT for it.
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,5,24-Jan-16,"..OMG I thot all salted egg crab taste like salted egg crab, but this one is amazing . Den ofcos you have to try t HorFun, believe me it's unbelievable..  Service is wonderful too They speak English"
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,20-Nov-19,"most food are delicious, for crab dishes order in advance or reserve, this item is a favourite."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,3,18-Aug-15,"I was brought to KEK as part of a large group of international sales people who gathered for a training event. A local rep told us she takes clients here, but I would not recommend that unless they are natives and comfortable with Asian outdoor dining. I believe other reviewers called this scenario a ""tze char"" store. As a visitor, I let our locals order, and we had an on-going supply of family-style plates of yummies. These were all very tasty and a good variety. As a NC native, sitting outdoors in the humidity and heat did not bother me, it was the same as being back at home, LOL.  The troubling items for KEK was that the atmosphere seemed cheap, especially in comparison to where business travelers normally end up. One of my local counterparts was very, very dissatisfied with the restaurant, but as a first-timer I took it all in stride and chalked that up to his own tastes. The plates and cutlery were cheap cafeteria materials or ""fake china"" plastic ware, the tables were covered with red shrink-wrap, and we sat right up alongside stacks of eggs and other supplies for the kitchen.  For me, this was acceptable as an experience in a new part of the world, but I would not take co-workers to such a place unless giving them the local flavor and kitsch was part of the allure, such as a saw-dust floor at a BBQ joint or paper-covered tables at a crab or oyster house. If it was a local eatery for my family, that might also make it more acceptable."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,3,19-Aug-13,"Ming Zhu juan/roll. Try it once, so you can say you've had it. It's got Chinese ham. How's it different? I can't say...but it's certainly an experience trying to cram ham, salted egg, mushroom, and that special Chinese ham.  Other than that, it does the classic things well, I suppose. A tasty Jiu Gao soup, spinach with very generous amount of crispy ikan bilis, and hae chor and har cheong gai were all well received, and disappeared into our bellies without much comment.  Interestingly, our party of 6 also had something called Yue Liang He Fen, which translates moonlight hor fun? I hear it's called that because the raw eggs they crack over the hor fun give the noodles a delightfully smooth texture and glossy sheen... but that's what I hear.  Its good food, and was relatively affordable, but I'm not sure why they are SO crowded! Maybe I need to go with a veteran to see what the famous dishes are."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,18-Oct-13,You may try some of the dishes shown in those captured pics... to check their quality up. Enjoyyy...
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,21-Feb-16,"Remember to make reservations a few days in advance!  If you like pork liver, be sure to order the claypot spring onion liver... I think it's the single best dish on offer."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,25-Oct-14,"I went here with my Singaporean friends and they did all the ordering. And I think all were flavorful and cooked well.  The Ming Zou rolls I think is their best seller, quite delicious. We had the chili crabs, pepper crabs and salted egg crabs and the best one was the salted egg crabs. I also recommend the fried battered squid, the roast chicken and the leafy vegetables with eggs. Both the marmite pork and chicken were good -- don't worry, if you are not a marmite fan, the marmite flavor was not very strong. Everyone raved about the liver dish but I am not a liver fan so I cannot comment myself.  The service was good and quick. Am just not sure if the ordering will be easy if I was not with chinese speaking folks. I hope their menus have photos!  I have been here twice for dinner but both at very odd times -- at 5pm and another at 930pm -- so the parking was quite easy. If you come early, I suggest booking a table inside the air conditioned room so its not too hot. If you are doing a late dinner, then its ok to sit outside."
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,28-Dec-13,Fourth time here and it's as good as ever. We usually have the steamed fish Hong Kong style but tonight tried marmite chicken and nonya prawns (special). Excellent all of it. Highly recommended local eatery.
Keng Eng Kee Seafood,3.9,29,Seafood,4,19-May-13,"The marmite chicken is great, even for someone who hates marmite!!"
Treasures Yi Dian Xin,4.7,3,"Congee, Dim Sum, Noodles",4,20-Jun-17,"Still my favourite Chinese food restaurant since I tried their 100am outlet. Food was served fast on a Saturday afternoon and service was efficient and pleasant.  There is the option of which part of the duck/chicken you'd like should you order their roasted specials, and an additional $2 for the leg. I would recommend choosing the duck leg when ordering the roasted duck noodles-it's extremely flavourful and the duck meat is served in a generous portion.  Other dim sum dishes I usually order include their chicken feet and fried shrimp in bean curd skin. Absolutely love them!"
Treasures Yi Dian Xin,4.7,3,"Congee, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,21-Nov-16,"This was some of the best Chinese food I had while in Singapore. They have many locations throughout Singapore. The servers are very nice and fast. The menu is very extensive. You can have anything from dim sum, to congee & noodles, to traditional entrees. I had congee and dim sum. All of it was excellent and fresh. This particular location is in a mall which is convenient. It's well lit and very clean."
Treasures Yi Dian Xin,4.7,3,"Congee, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,11-Apr-19,"Had the #16, #21, #78, #89 (with duck and pork), and another #78. Every single thing was delicious and brought out quickly. Friendly waitresses and good prices. Highly recommend!!"
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,5,6-Aug-17,"""Nailed it,"" I said no less than four times during my meal tonight at La Strada. Every thing about this place begs me to come back for more. Hands down my favorite Italian fare in SG. Go here, and thank me later. This restaurant is worth every dime.  Sweet, fresh, fragrant and balanced bruschetta. Tender and responsive gnocchi. Healthy, juicy and succulent pork chop. Best of all, the bolognese is the best I have had since eating the mindblowingly amazing bolognese of Osteria dell'Orsa in Bologna, Italy, itself.  I will come back here again and again. The non-pretentious osteria-style decor and home cooked quality food will invite me back with open arms every time."
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,4,23-Aug-19,"Wait a minute! This place can't be the same I eat and rated just last year?!!! The decor is different, the menu is different, and so on ..... still very pricey as well. I had their Ribeye dish and mixed salad plus desert and a beet and the total was above 100 SGD! Very good service and the taste was good. But too much money overall."
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,4,20-Jan-18,"It's a good restaurant on the smaller side. I had a basic dish, baked chicken with vegetables and fries. I was early during their dinner hours. So I had the full attention of several servers and I was in and out in 45 minutes. Which was just fine with me."
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,5,4-Apr-17,"Was recommended by a friend to dine here, and there were really no regrets!  Quaint little place in the heart of town with one of the best risottos I've had in a while. Came here for dinner, but their set lunch menu does look very affordable, and value for money. Had the squid ink risotto with scallops (typically only on the lunch menu but they acceded to my special request), and they were extremely generous with the squid ink sauce, the scallops were well cooked (not too dry). The fianc¨¦ had the lobster risotto which he polished off really quickly! The seaweed made the rice extremely tasty.  It is a little pricy but it really was worth it! The service was excellent as well; the waitresses were really attentive."
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,4,15-Nov-15,"Nice little gem located at Scott's Road just right next to shaw center. Love the food there - we ordered a set lunch which consist of an appetizer, main and dessert.  The appetizers we ordered were: beef carpaccio with truffle dressing and burrata. First of all, the truffle dressing for the carpaccio was good topped with a very distinct taste of the truffle dressing. The burrata has got to be my favorite. It has an excellent buffalo mozzarella - thick and creamy, followed by the amazing taste of the salmon on the side. It was a great combo between the two, accompanied by breadsticks.  For the main I ordered risotto in squid ink with scallops. The risotto was up to par. But I preferred more of what my boyfriend ordered which was spaghetti carbonara: with truffle butter, egg confit and bacon crumble. It was delish. The dish was overall very creamy and buttery, with a strong kick of the truffle taste. It was a pretty small serving for this one, I guess becoz it was rich and creamy. Oh, and it was topped with an egg and it was just excellent! Must come back!"
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,4,23-Jun-16,"Nice and cozy place with great pastas, especially loved the seaweed risotto and tagliatelle pasta ! The fish croquettes to start were really good too  You can also order off the menu if you have your usual basic pasta favorites  Liked the concept and the food, although the small place did not ventilate too well, left you coming out smelling like a kitchen."
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,4,20-Jan-19,"I visited for the first time. It was good atmosphere and friendly and kind staffs. We ordered 3 lunch course. I chose the soup for starter. It was very creamy and tasty. I liked it. The second section was also many kind of choices, so after much dithering, I decided to order the king salmon.The skin was bit crispy but whole fish was meltingly soft.The herb lemon sauce also very matched with fish.Finally for desert, I chose panna cotta with maybe caramel sauce also yummy. The complimentary coffee was also great.We really enjoyed having lunch. I'll definitely visit again."
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,4,5-Apr-18,"Casual-feel Italian restaurant that everyone can enjoy.  Same owners as next doors Aoki and Le Amis, this place is somewhere you can get a great tasting appetizer, flavorful main course dish, order a reasonable priced bottle of wine and relax.  Highly recommend their Vongole as a starter and their lobster spaghetti as a main course. Not sure if they still have their spinner crab pasta but if they do, get that.  Get a nice Amarone with those courses and you are set for the night.  Service is great, very friendly staff.  Not the best or freshest Italian in the area but definitely recommend for a good night out."
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,5,1-Oct-17,"We slid in for a table at about 1:36, oh boy were we lucky!! My hubby had the steak and I had the Oso Bucco (spell check please!). The restaurant was small and cozy and the waitress was just too darn cute. We would go back in a heart beat if we lived in Singapore!"
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,4,10-Mar-17,"Delicious food, great service. Little on the pricey side.  The risotto was delicious and I highly recommend it."
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,3,6-Jan-16,"They offer an appetiser + main course + dessert 3 course lunch for $35. You add extra for special orders. Went with my family so we all ordered a variety of dishes to share. Overall, the food wasn't that impressive and I'm on the fence about whether I'd return. If I do, it'd mostly be for the ambience and service.   AMBIENCE - 5 stars Cute and cosy. My kind of place.   SERVICE - 4 stars Great! They were accommodating in allowing us to top up to change the dessert to the dessert of the day (cannoli). They ran out of pistachio gelato which accompanied the cannoli, didn't inform us and simply swopped it with vanilla ice cream. I don't quite like ice cream so the waiter kindly gave us a complimentary scoop of yoghurt gelato, which was delicious.   APPETISER Burrata (+$4) - with applewood smoked salmon - 4 stars My favourite starter. Comes with a huge ball of burrata so definitely share this. I really liked the salmon, which didn't taste fishy at all.  Capesante (+$3) - seared scallops - 2 stars Skip this. The scallops are rubbery.  Indivia - endive salad - 3 stars Simple, good salad   MAIN Pollo - chicken stew My sister liked this so much I didn't get to try any!  Tacchino - breaded turkey breast stuffed with fontina cheese - 2.5 stars Didn't quite enjoy this. I suppose it's what you might expect of the dish, and it was too rich and heavy for me. The brussels sprouts were over-salted.  Risotto (+$3) - squid ink risotto with scallops - 2.5 stars Again, I thought the scallops were rubbery. The risotto was alright, but I'm not a fan of risotto.   DESSERT Yoghurt gelato - 4 stars My favourite dessert. Refreshing tangy taste.  Limoncello tiramisu (+$3) - 3.5 stars A nice twist on a traditional dessert. But too much cream for me.  Pera (+$4) - 3 stars - poached pear, red wine, vanilla ice cream Nothing special.  Cannoli with pistachio gelato - 2.5 stars They ran out of pistachio gelato. The cannoli itself was soft and nothing special - I don't usually enjoy it and this dish didn't change my mind.   COFFEE/TEA They serve Clipper tea, and can do cappuccinos/lattes with skim milk, which was a nice bonus. No soy milk."
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,5,12-May-19,"First visit to the restaurant on a weekday night: There was a pleasant and soothing ambience. The staff pulled out a display of seasonal dishes that were not available on their usual menu, did a great job on explaining the dishes, and we ordered two appetizers from the list. A particular staff, Amber, stood out in particular with her exceptional service and made our dinner at La Strada so comforting and welcoming. We also ordered two main courses from the primi section, the portion was incredibly generous and tasty. For dessert, we settled for the creme brulee, which was rich in flavour, will definitely recommend."
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,1,27-Oct-18,"Was a horrible experience . We arrived there and it was one hour and a half before 2:30 (the time The close) and they said it was full and it wasn't . They had tables available and people also already about to leave . We asked how long did we have to wait and they said no tables . The Chinese guy was so rude to us even closed the door at our faces. He didn't even say that maybe 30 minutes. I think they were lazy to work, I don't know about the food but the quality of service was definitely very very poor. I would not give even one star."
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,5,10-Aug-14,Love t wine list ... And altho kitchen has close We stayed to finish our wine & t water ar really frendly about it and polite & did not shoo us out ... Lovely lunch
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,5,26-Jan-16,"I couldn't ask for more from a local Italian restaurant. Great menu. Attentive service. And wonderful result on the palette. Started with some amazing oysters. For the main course the manager helped coach me through some options. I'm a fan of veal saltimboca whenever I can get it. It was interesting, and very good (amazing how different it is prepared nearly every time I try it, but rarely disappoints). But the custom side pasta was out of this world. Just some linguine in olive oil and white wine sauce with garlic and a touch of hot pepper. Fantastic. Can't wait to come back again. So much more menu exploration to do. Only downside was price. But hey, it's Singapore."
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,5,27-Dec-16,"Excellent value for money, enhanced by amazing tasting food and good service. We had the set lunch here recently. Appetizers were scallops done just right and a cesare salad with yummy dressing. For mains we had the ravioli with sage butter and carbonara. Both pastas were delicious. Dessert was a true treat - lemon tiramisu and cassatta. Will definitely go here again."
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,5,10-Dec-17,"This is a hidden spot behind Orchard Road so if you don't know to go in search of it, you won't find it. I was able to snag a reserved table even though I didn't have a reservation because I went at 6:30pm and they didn't need the table until 8:30pm. If you go after 7pm, make a reservation because they were turning people away at the door. I settled on the braised oxtail ($36). This was very delicious and someone put a lot of love into this dish with the teeny tiny carrots cut up and the amount of thyme. However, for me, it ended up being more of an appetizer portion (I was hungry - Piggy Power was in effect) and it needed some mashed potatoes or more bread to sop up the gravy. I ended up ordering the beef and pork ragout gnocchi ($28) and that was phenomenal. Just pillows of gnocchi covered in the delicious ragout. I want more! I had a glass of Barbera ($15) to wash it down. I can't wait to go back!"
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,5,23-Nov-15,Was invited to this restraint on Monday evening and was very pleased with service and food. Great little Italian restaurant. Highly recommended.
La Strada,4.3,18,Italian,4,12-Nov-17,Small restaurant . Nice food. Average service. Hard to find --look for it behind the 1 Scott large complex--alike to an alley.
Sin Heng Kee Porridge,4.9,14,"Singaporean, Congee",5,7-Oct-19,Better value than the overpriced bad service Heng Long teochew porridge!! Fast service.. great taste and efficient staff. Coffee's great. Don't order the bean curds.. uncle says stopped selling a year ago.. But the poster still showing!! Great for a hot meal!!
Sin Heng Kee Porridge,4.9,14,"Singaporean, Congee",4,13-Mar-24,Personal favourite is their triple egg (Èýµ°) porridge that includes normal + salted + century egg  Can get pretty popular and crowded especially on weekend mornings though
Sin Heng Kee Porridge,4.9,14,"Singaporean, Congee",5,26-Feb-23,Porridge is very scrumptious and great. The portions are huge and there is a great variety of porridges to choose from.
Sin Heng Kee Porridge,4.9,14,"Singaporean, Congee",5,29-Dec-22,"One of the best porridge stalls in Singapore, if not the best. Meatballs are a must order."
Sin Heng Kee Porridge,4.9,14,"Singaporean, Congee",5,30-Jan-22,"Was in a crave for congee. Did some googling and this place came up. It was definitely worth the 18 minutes drive. The line wasn't so bad when I arrive at 8.30am but shortly after, a long snakey line form up. Most people ordered to go and they have an excellent number queing and seating waiting area, almost like going for your Covid vaccination. Extremely orderly. Best part, the food was excellent! I ordered the pork congee with extra pork ball. 2 thumbs up"
Sin Heng Kee Porridge,4.9,14,"Singaporean, Congee",5,18-Oct-16,"One of the best porridge located at the north east area. Never failed to order Ìï¼¦ to go along with any porridge. Today I tried their Æ¤µ°»¨ÉúÖà, simply delicious. If you are not a fan of Ìï¼¦, you can just try their signature porridge with overloaded ingredients. Confirm plus chop you will be bloated after 1 serving!  Parking is not an issue, huge open space carpark just need to worry if it rains.  Be prepared to wait at least 10-15mins just to be seated and another 10-15mins for the dishes (during peak hour)."
Sin Heng Kee Porridge,4.9,14,"Singaporean, Congee",5,12-Feb-18,Great porridge  My only sadness is that there is no delivery service with this outlet.  Could someone please get them on deliveroo/Uber eat?
Sin Heng Kee Porridge,4.9,14,"Singaporean, Congee",5,28-Oct-18,"Taste good and generous serving, fresh ingredients used. Remember to get a plate of the century eggs with ginger as side. Must try when you are in Hougang."
Sin Heng Kee Porridge,4.9,14,"Singaporean, Congee",5,30-Nov-16,Was ard Buangkok area looking for food and come across this on Yelp. No regrets. Price is considered very fair for the quality and quantity. Strongly recommended.
Sin Heng Kee Porridge,4.9,14,"Singaporean, Congee",5,19-Dec-15,"For a person who don't have a taste for porridge, I would say the porridge served here is very good. The ingredients they used are very fresh and the portion is very generous too! For the price you pay ($3.50 - $5.00) you would get a big bowl of congee. I can legitimately say that this is the only place I would eat porridge at so if you have not tried the food here yet,I highly recommend you to try the porridge here!!! I've tried the Meat ball porridge which I added peanuts to it. The meatballs we're really fresh and the congee had the perfect viscosity to it! The peanuts complimented the meatball congee perfectly and overall one of the best porridge I ate in my life. Meatball and peanuts porridge - 9/10"
Sin Heng Kee Porridge,4.9,14,"Singaporean, Congee",5,31-Jan-17,"Very velvety smooth porridge. Priced at $4.50, their lean pork century egg porridge are loaded with ingredients. Lean pork is simply marinated and tender. I didn't have to season my porridge further as it tasted just how I like. They use styrofoam bowl for takeaway. Mine remain warm and tasted good even after an hour."
Sin Heng Kee Porridge,4.9,14,"Singaporean, Congee",5,4-Nov-17,Wah this porridge is super super nice. Definitely must try. It's cheap and delicious. Tried the fish porridge and minced meat porridge. Both are very smooth and nice.
Sin Heng Kee Porridge,4.9,14,"Singaporean, Congee",5,16-Jun-13,"I was driving around looking for food when I finally decided to stop and try out this shop that sells all kinds of Porridge.  Ever wonder what to give your toddler for lunch or dinner when you don't cook ? Then try this, the porridge is so hot then it zap any bacteria or virus of any kind !  Basically their menu has 3 versions, one is normal egg with your variety of pork related porridge, other is century egg with your variety of pork related porridge or No egg with your variety of pork related porridge. Can also order ""KOSONG"" which is plain porridge with or without seasonings or condiments. They also have ""frog porridge"" which I have not tried yet.  One of the best pork porridge I have tried. They will scoop out plain porridge from one big pot to cook with your choice of pork meat balls, pork intestines, pork liver ETC. And they also have side dishes like fritters and yu sheng.  So stop having mediocre porridge at those lousy food courts and try this instead !"
Sin Heng Kee Porridge,4.9,14,"Singaporean, Congee",4,7-Sep-13,Accidental find. Was in the neighborhood and I chanced upon this store. Porridge is delicious. Don't forget to order raw fish. Highly recommended. Might have to wait for your order if you visit during the usual peak hours.
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,4,15-Nov-20,"Gets Quite busy on a friday evening, do make a reservation before you make it there. Food is great, but you might not get attended asap since its busy. We had to wait 35 mins to get our drink, by which time we had finished out meal. But understandable it was busy, food was great and complaints there."
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,4,30-Jun-18,Authentic and hearty Italian food. Can get crowded on weekends so reservations recommended. I usually look out for the daily special on the board above the open kitchen. Staff is able to introduce the menu and make good recommendations.
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,3,27-Mar-16,"I don't usually like Italian food, but this place is not too bad. I always have the pig's ears pasta for lunch here with colleagues, and have had a taste of other pasta dishes and appetizers here. While you can't go wrong with fried seafood or bruschetta with truffle paste, the food here is safe and on the pricey side.  Meat and fish mains come up to about $30-$40 which I feel is pricey for the location which is very out of the way. Now that HillV2 has stopped their shuttle bus from my office to their mall, I doubt I'll be popping by on purpose for my Italian fix."
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,4,8-Jul-18,"A bit pricey, but food is very nice. Porchetta, baked pork belly is a must-try. In-house baked bread and Italian street food are awesome. Chocolate lava cake is rich and yummy..."
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,5,25-Mar-17,"Can't believe that I forgot to review this when I had been going here for quite some time already. iO is definitely a hidden gem in the Hillview neighbourhood, but once you tried it, you would feel that the long travel there is all worth it.  iO serve various italian offerings with some Chef Specials that is rotated every once in a while. My recommendation from their menu would be the meatballs and eggplant parmegiana for starters. They tasted really great that I have always ordered them whenever I'm around. Another thing you should get would be their pastas. Their pastas are just really good and I don't think it's commonly offered in other western restaurants here in Singapore. Other than that, you should try their Chef Specials. They are significantly more expensive than other offerings but it was well worth the price.  If you happen to have a sweet tooth, maybe it's wiser to come down on weekends since they have more selections of desserts on weekends.  Price, I would say were quite steep. However, it was all justified by the responsive and cheery staff (never before I encountered staff that would still make small chats with you in SG despite how busy it was), chef that actually bothered to go around and ask us about our opinions, great food and ambiance.  Overall, I am happy to give this place a 5 stars. Good thing to note (as I believe others have reiterated countless times) is to reserve your seats beforehand, they're pretty busy around dinner time!"
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,5,12-Jan-16,My wife and I had the salami pizza and some meatballs. It was very tasty and the price was reasonable. I think about $40 for a large pizza and the meatballs. You can have a bunch of tapas type small meals for about $8 to $10 each. The place looks cool and it was pumping full of people but the service was still friendly and fast. Didn't Get to try their coffee but I will be back to try that as it smelt awesome. We are looking forward to our next visit.
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,4,11-Mar-18,"Authentic, simple, good italian food. Good service. Only thing, it closes way too early--not Italian on that, but I guess they had to localize something! :-) Too bad for the location a bit off the beaten road."
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,5,23-Oct-16,Awesome place! I am really surprised by this place given that it is located in such an inconspicuous place. I was there on a Saturday night and it was full (so be sure to make a reservation to avoid disappointments!). You can choose to order the pastas on the menu or opt for classics by telling them what you want. I would highly recommend the pesto pasta (not on the menu) which consists of generous servings of pesto sauce and parmesan cheese. Service was pretty good and I would highly recommend this place!
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,4,20-May-15,"Quite a trek to get to, but may be worth the hike. The store front doubles as a bakery, and store also sells dried, bottled and canned goods. The ceiling to floor windows help greatly with making the place appear big, and inviting. The place is always full, lending a nice 'bustling' atmosphere. Despite this, the staff are all attentive and very friendly, with the owner and chef helping out with front of house from time to time.  I personally recommend sticking to the 'street' type food - the pizzas and breads are good, especially the schiacciata. The starters and pastas are decent. The only secondi we ever tried over several visits really disappointed us and resultantly, have stayed away from them. So far desserts have been hits and misses!  Generally a relaxed place to have a casual meal with friends."
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,4,6-Jul-16,"iO is a newer Italian place at Hill V2 in a gorgeous space overlooking the neighborhood. While it is mainly a restaurant, they also offer quite a bit of Italian goods for sale and the open space is seamless. As for the food, it's quite good with a solid selection of starters, pastas, and main. We started off with a couple of starters which were both awesome - the stuffed Schiacciata and burrata. The schiacciata was very tasty - bread stuffed with cheese and mushrooms with truffle flavor. The burrata was also quite good, as it was accompanied with prosciutto and greens, and we went for a double order for the table and had no trouble polishing it. We tried a few pasta dishes as well. The bigoli with seafood was quite nice, but the taglioni with walnut sauce was less accessible. The seared snapper was also solid, and next time, I would love to try some of the meat dishes as well. There is a short wine list, with an interesting choice for house wine, where a full liter will run you only $48. While it doesn't drink like a fine barolo, it's a great bargain, although I wish they wouldn't chill the red wine. Overall, while the prices may not seem very cheap, the portions are generous, especially when compared to my fave - Osteria Mozza. Definitely worth a visit and also with a larger group!"
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,5,3-Sep-17,"Wow - by far now our new favourite Italian and likely top 2 restaurant in all of Singapore. The atmosphere was awesome - loud, fun, friends having a good time and just felt like a house full of food loving people. The food was done to perfection all well within a good price for Singapore. We had various plates but the pizza appetiser with crunchy crust was over the top good and the mushroom bruschetta was outstanding. We will be back for sure as this is a gem in Singapore."
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,5,29-Jul-16,Fantastic food! I almost don't want to write a review because I don't wanna give this gem away.
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,5,3-Nov-14,"What a wonderful contemporary Italian restaurant this is. Comparable to Jones the Grocer, this is partial restaurant and partial market. Situated in the trendy new Hillv2 mall, built underneath a Soho style condominium complex."
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,1,16-Jul-17,"Was gonna order main on the menu, but the waiter recommended the ""daily special"", the Sea Salt Baked Sea Bass, claiming it was ""much better"" When the bill came, this daily special turned out to be $78. I would not recommend iO Osteria where so-called ""friendly"" waiters are deceitful in conveniently leaving off the price of a dish 3x more expensive than the dish we were about to order. There are better authentic Italian restaurants in Singapore that do not have to resort to such tactics to stay afloat!!!"
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,5,5-May-18,"An unassuming place, but true and authentic, amazing find and such a gem of a place. Try the bacon balls and the tomahawk, can't go wrong!"
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,5,6-Feb-15,"Amazingly delicious pizza slices to go, friendly staff who answer all our questions about the menu and offerings, and even let us try their freshly baked breads and pizzas when we looked curiously. Their apricot pie was divine! Fresh ingredients and an in house stone oven they reheat the pizzas in before serving! I hate pizza in Singapore unless it's from O! Prices are a bit high though but can't say the quality doesn't back it up. def gotta come back fr their pastas"
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,5,29-Dec-15,Without a doubt my favorite Italian restaurant in Singapore. Friendly family style setting great food and warm friendly staff. Only downside is parking can be quite troublesome on the weekends. My favorite dining option is to sit at the counter surrounding the kitchen watching the dishes come out and then dice ding which one I want. Have been here numerous times and never been disappointed
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,5,15-Nov-15,"This is our favorite place to eat in Singapore. Fantastic food. Solid service. The place is always busy, which is testament to the draw of the food. Note that the car park is awful--frequently full with a long line of trapped cars waiting patiently."
iO Italian Osteria,4.4,19,Italian,5,20-Dec-15,Fantastic Italian food with dry food section ala Dean and Deluca. This area is beginning to be awesome for Italian with this and the more homely Cacio E Pepe nearby! It's like going out to eat at a remote village in Italy haha!
Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.7,15,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,6-Mar-19,The fragrant rice is awesome and the chicken is good but not like wow.  Wouldn't say it's head and shoulders better than the stuff we can get back home in LA.  The portion for two people I would consider as a single 'Murican serving. Price is maybe a little cheaper than in LA  The liver was a good deal though. I ordered 4pcs @ 0.50ea and apparently chicken liver is bigger than chickens cause 4 liver was like way more meat than the double chicken portion we got. £º£©
Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.7,15,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,25-Jun-16,"Chicken rice is a comfort food for Singaporean, I always try to eat chicken rice at every visit to this country.  What I learned over the years is every chicken rice taste slightly different. It's like each place have own recipe. Their chicken is one of the best I had. I really liked their fragranced rice. I could eat just rice alone.  We ordered both roasted and steam chicken. Roasted was crispy outside and both were really juicy. I enjoyed with thick soy sauce, chili paste and ginger mixed sauce. Broth soup served with the rush had a very nice flavor, I was still feeling hangover from previous night, this broth was so comforting to my tummy, I felt so much better after lunch.  Tow Miao vegetables was cooked with great flavor. It was so tasty and went well with the rice, I almost thought about asking for the second plate of rice.  Come early, preferably by 11:30am to avoid crowds. They were packed with customers by 12:10pm."
Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.7,15,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,14-Mar-18,"How can you come allllll the way to Singapore and not stop somewhere to have the famed Hainanese chicken and rice? What sort of world traveler and food eater would I be?  Even though I was in Singapore for less than 24 hours, I made it my mission to find SOMEWHERE that served this delectable treat.  After asking around, I finally found a spot nearby. Unfortunately I had already stuffed my face with various other foods (dry noodles, stone pot steak, fresh blended juices, etc) literally minutes before finding this spot.  The service was average, but the food came out swiftly. I ordered the Hainanaese chicken which came with a soup and the delicious chicken broth rice.  I originally thought it I would rate this a 3-star spot, but I decided that since I was stuffed to the brim already and was still able to eat all the chicken that it deserves 4 stars. That, or I'm a fatty with plenty of handles for the loving. Either way if I were back in town, I'd make the trip back since it has a convenient location and the food was good."
Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.7,15,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,10-Mar-17,"Serves an array of Singaporean cuisines. Very casual restaurant. Don't expect too much service wise. Seems reasonably clean.  The Hainan chicken in delicious!! The salty egg pork was also very good. Cereal prawns were average. As was the chilli crab. So yeh, stick to the meats, they taste better and are cheaper!"
Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.7,15,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,7-Sep-17,"The reason why I gave 4/5 stars is simply because I have experience eating Hainanese chicken and expectations for how it should be cooked and prepared. I am sure the chicken was good, if not great, to most people but to me, it was simply just okay.  In addition, the place was packed which made it hard for us to put in orders with the waitress/waiters.  Despite all of the above, it did feel like a hustling and bustling Chinese/hainanese restaurant and my stomach did feel satisfied after eating half a chicken.  In terms of pricing, everything was in the mid-tier. Nothing too expensive or cheap. Their drinks are pretty good and adequately priced."
Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.7,15,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,20-Apr-19,"Favorite chicken rice in Singapore. Consistently good tasting and reasonably priced. The fragrant rice is particularly good, as is the sauce with the chicken. The restaurant always seems busy, but somehow the wait is never more than two minutes."
Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.7,15,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,16-Sep-17,"4th floor was not easy to find in this mall. Got there at 10am and had to wait another 30 minutes for opening. Seems a lot of people ordered delivery and one staff went out with like more than 20 takeout boxes at opening. For me, roasted chicken was better than white chicken."
Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.7,15,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,12-Jan-16,"Chicken Rice. So flavorful, and delicious.  I need you in me again, soon.  Being from the US, I was shocked by the courteous service and sit down atmosphere in a mall restaurant. I was even more surprised by the quality of food that was being served for such an affordable price. INSIDE a mall."
Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.7,15,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",3,25-Dec-16,"Wee Nam Kee has been my fave chicken rice stall from when it was located at Novena Ville. While there are elements of similarities, the soya sauce chicken is not quite the same or as good as before"
Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.7,15,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",2,25-Mar-17,"Ok, I don't quite get it. I hear Singapore chicken rice is a great dish. I had it here which was recommended as one of the best places to get it. I'm afraid to ask what's bad.  First it's just chicken in an average sauce and then rice on the side. The chicken is cold (which is ridiculous); I also had BBQ pork which was cold. I asked the seater if it should be cold and he said yes.  So, if you are hankering for a great Singapore dish-skip this one and go for something else. It is unimpressive and overrated.  Sorry."
Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.7,15,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",3,29-May-15,This place is pretty basic. Nothing fancy. No frills. But the steamed chicken and cup of broth is such a comforting meal after a long day or when you get home sick :-)
Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.7,15,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",1,21-Apr-18,"If I could give zero stars, I would. Horror story begins now. Marina square outlet. Shop 1/4 filled. We came as a group of 15. They merged two tables for 12 pax. I asked if we could add one more table on the side. They said it was the manager we arrange this. I insisted that it's not logical to force 15pax in a 12 pax table. It's not one more but 3more. I let it go since everyone was in a good mood today. Waitress went to speak to another colleague who appeared to have more authority. But what she said next took away my hunger for that night. No joke. I literally stopped feeling hungry. First time in my life. ""If you want lor. I can join this table lor. If you want."" Using two fingers and a thumb to hold a 30kg table. That's how much she really wants to do it. I replied. It's okay. Let's leave it. We ordered so much that the table had no space and all these while. The two large tables beside us only sat two pax. As if it could piss me off further. Bloody table with two pax who ordered two plates of chicken rice. The other areas of the restaurant was still only half filled. The Chilli crab is crap. Best of all, the very person who mess up this experience with them. Left for home carrying his bag at 7:30pm. Which restaurant manager leaves his shop at peak hour of the operations???? My first time going to Wee Nam Kee or whatever the name it is. The rest is history."
Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.7,15,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,3-Apr-16,"What makes a good restaurant is not how fancy it is but how good they are at making a perfect simple food staple such as hainanese rice and Chinese food. I used to go here for the hainanese chicken rice and I know they are good, but this is the first time I ordered their Chinese food menu including soup, fish, hotpot, etc and how they don't disappoint. This will be a recommendation and go to place when you want to have a Chinese feast and want them to be perfectly cooked and delicious. And I don't need to mentioned their very tender and juicy chicken right?"
Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice,3.7,15,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,13-Apr-13,"Wee Nam Kee served my first chicken rice in Singapore and needless to say, it was the best chicken rice I had during my stay that semester. Their space at Marina Square, however, is kinda to small. While it's a strategic place to meet up, it might not be so good to dine there with a group."
Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa,4.5,11,"Hawker Centre, Asian Fusion",4,1-Oct-22,"You cannot say that you've visited Singapore without slurping down a bowl of hot and spicy Laksa in a hawker center in 80 degree humid weather cramped with other patrons around.  I love a good laksa bowl that's filled with a pungent shrimp taste, creamy coconut broth balanced well with savory spices. I sought out this vendor for many reasons - they are Michelin awarded, locally acclaimed and voted one of the best foods to enjoy in previous years. So we set out for a late lunch one day only to catch the owners closing up shop around 2:30 pm. They asked that we come back the next day to try their famous bowls.  Hungry and disappointed, we left to satisfy our Laksa craving elsewhere and came back the next day. It was the only stall with a long line for lunch (I counted 12+ people snaking line around the hawker center tables). People passed by taking pictures of the stand and deciding whether it was worth the wait to stand in line.  We ordered 3 bowls (one bowl of each dish they offered) to share: the Asia Delight Laska, Fruit Juice Mee Siam and Mee Rebus. I honestly cannot tell you the difference between the three. They shared the same broth and looked similar. Also, don't expect a lobster or a big prawn tail in your bowl like their sign advertises. See my pictures for reference. A light, salty, fishy, shrimpy, umami, creamy coconut broth with pieces of meat, tofu, bean sprouts and seafood scattered throughout the bowl - was it worth the try? Absolutely! Was it the best Laksa we've had in Singapore? It came in close. In my opinion, a bit more spice and spicy-ness would have balanced out the sweet/creamy coconut based broth a bit more. The noodles didn't cut it for me; they were the short, thick rice noodles that reminded me of the vietnamese banh canh dishes back home. I would have preferred a longer noodle for maximum slurpage.  Needless to say, this is a place worth visiting and trying if you're ever in Singapore :)"
Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa,4.5,11,"Hawker Centre, Asian Fusion",4,21-Jan-23,"Located on the 2nd floor, it will be right in front of the lift on the left. Enjoyed the taste of their laksa soup, the sambal sauce is fragrant and not spicy. A bowl of laksa is around SGD5 .50 with fishcakes, chicken, shrimps and clams if you prefer, while you can pay a few dollars more for a bigger prawn as topping."
Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa,4.5,11,"Hawker Centre, Asian Fusion",5,21-Feb-22,"I believe my husband found this place on Singapore Eater. I guess they are also Michelin Recommended too! I don't typically like Laksa, but I actually enjoyed this bowl a lot. I believe we got their ""Delight Laksa"" bowl, which came out to $5 SG. The broth was so light, yet still having that slightly creamy and briny flavor! (other times I've had Laksa in the past, it tastes way too thick and heavy).  I also liked the accompaniments, with the spicy flavor addition on the side, the tofu, and bits of lobster and shrimp. There wasn't much total in extra toppings, but the sum of them added a lot of flavor to the dish, quite sophisticated for $5 SG.  I loved this light bowl of Laksa!!!"
Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa,4.5,11,"Hawker Centre, Asian Fusion",3,18-Nov-19,"Again this is a matter of personal preference but I thought it was just ok. It's on the 2nd floor of a rather large food center, a bit difficult to locate but with the help of good Samaritans I found it just as it opened for lunch.  Broth: 2/5, to me this is the most important component of any laksa. Unlike the typical SGP laksas that are loaded with curry and coconut milk, this version sticks with the basic seafood flavor. I am a big fan of Cantonese style seafood soup, I also liked the Assam style laksa broth in Penang, but I found this broth somewhat bland. My partner and I both looked at each other & said ""where is the flavor""? Perhaps it was just a bad batch from that day? Noodle and seafood:4/5, I paid extra to get the bowl loaded with shrimps and crawfish (baby lobster), noodles was good, no complaints here. Value: 4/5, even with all the extra seafood loaded in my bowl I think it was only like $9 SGP, which is a great deal. if you eat in a nice restaurant the price can easily be doubled if not more.  Overall I was somewhat disappointed by this famous laksa, the broth in particular was a letdown for me."
Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa,4.5,11,"Hawker Centre, Asian Fusion",5,8-Aug-19,"I had my first Laksa ever just yesterday here, and I must say that it was honestly a fantastic experience.  Located in a corner of Singapore's Chinatown, Famous Sungei Road Trikshaw Laksa is one stall among the many hawker stalls located in Chinatown. Given this fact, it took a little searching and a lot of google map checking to find this place.  Despite the relative difficulty of finding this place though, the search is more than worth the effort. The Laksa here has a thick, rich soup similar to the best ramen shops I have been to while in Japan. And each bowl of Laksa has a large helping of seafood with a generous setving of noodles. However, what is perhaps the most surprising thing about the Laksa here is that the broth is able to preserve its rich taste by relying on seafood products as opposed to using fattier meats and other animal products (pork, beef, etc.).  The price here is also ideal at under 10 singaporean dollars a bowl. This is a place I would highly recommend."
Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa,4.5,11,"Hawker Centre, Asian Fusion",5,13-Feb-20,"For 9 SGD, you can get the crawfish asian delight laksa which is what they're known for. Loved the cockles, chicken and crawfish. The broth is coconut curry like and they provide a spoon of their red paste with it that works wonders. Wanted to go back for more. The line wasn't long at noon on Monday. Would definitely come back."
Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa,4.5,11,"Hawker Centre, Asian Fusion",5,19-Jan-18,"Reasonable 15 minute queue at 1215 on a Friday. Ordered the large Fruit Juice Mee Siam with Crayfish ($9), which was served up fast by the very friendly and cheerful owner.  And wow. This Mee Siam was special - the owner wouldn't divulge the recipe, but it was unique and refreshing. The Crayfish was a special add and worth it - freshly chopped and made in front of you. One of Singapore's hawker gems."
Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa,4.5,11,"Hawker Centre, Asian Fusion",5,8-Dec-16,"Laksa. The quintessential Singaporean noodle soup. If you're a visitor to Singapore then you undoubtedly want to find some place that does it pretty well. If you're a local, then you probably already have your thoughts on who does it best.  I've had my fair share of bowls of laksa during my few trips to Singapore. The particular bowl we ordered from here will forever stand out in my memory as the best I've tasted thus far and they have made me a future repeat customer on any subsequent visits to the hot and humid city-state.  Containing all the seafood items inside a typical bowl of laksa, it didn't have any trace of old fishy flavor or aroma that has happened on a few occasions that I've experienced elsewhere. Instead it had a much more rather sweet and savory mix of flavors and aroma.  The laksa here really impressed me down to the toothsome noodles. Every spoonful really had that ""oh, man, that's good"" kind of feel. It's no wonder the Michelin guide payed them a visit and recommended them."
Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa,4.5,11,"Hawker Centre, Asian Fusion",4,18-Mar-16,"Very good Laksa just like the review said.  Trishaw Laksa is already well known and has its own following. This stall in Hong Lim has no Yelp till now.  The broth is excellent, worthy of mention. The white noodles is soft tender, very easy to scoop and eat even without chopsticks. $4 is decent for Laksa. There are many good Laksa around.  For the $5 Laksa, they added probably half a prawn, 3 pieces of white chicken. For the $7 version, they add a crayfish on top of that.  Knock yourself out."
Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa,4.5,11,"Hawker Centre, Asian Fusion",5,11-Dec-17,"Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa is amazing. Search the Hawker Center for the long cue, but it's well worth the wait! The owner is very friendly and proud of his well deserved awards. Seafood Laksa with lobster, get the large. Very fresh and not too spicy. Goes well with the pressed cane sugar juice with lemon available next door."
Famous Sungei Road Trishaw Laksa,4.5,11,"Hawker Centre, Asian Fusion",5,8-Oct-19,"This has been my favorite thing I've tried so far in Singapore. The rich, seafood/curry broth is amazing. The noodles are nice and springy, and the Lobster was perfectly cooked! Another stand out about this place was how friendly the owners were. There are so many wonderful things to try in Singapore, but I will have to go back to this stand before my trip is over. Pro tip: If you want to get all the seafood toppings, you must get there before 3pm."
Forty Hands East Coast,4.5,2,Cafes,4,23-Aug-19,"*Coffee Snob Intro* When you're let go from a company the locations you frequent many many coffee shops.  These wonderful roasteries provide the perfect balance of professional attitude, casual attire, and passionate delivery to aid you in your job search.  I'm going to rate a bunch of coffee shops based on this metric and a few others and provide an overall rating for the experience.  ---------------------------------- OVERALL: 4 stars  Ambience: 3 Coffee: 5 Food: 5 Meeting Place: 3 Working Space: 3 ----------------------------------  *Coffee Review* Forty Hands! It conjures up a multitude of anecdotes and amusing one liners ""open sesame"" and ""making light work"" amongst them; and so it is that 40 Hands comes to the East Coast.  When I first came to SG just on 4 years ago now, one of the first real coffee shops that I visited was 40 Hands in Tiong Bahru. I made the mistake of going on a weekend to that particular location, and realised just how popular it was... actually that whole area is an amazing m¨¦lange of coffee/brunch/cocktail options.  Since moving to the East Coast there were very few coffee options nearby my condo so it was a real pleasure to have 40 Hands move in for this java snob.  I had a buddy over recently from Oz, and every morning we were looking for a cup of the dark stuff, and something to nibble on. 40 hands came to the rescue 3 days in a row with strong coffee and a delicious bacon 'n' egg brekkie roll which is an 'Strayan staple.  I probably don't get here as often as I should, but it's definitely one of the first places to spring to mind for weekend coffee."
Forty Hands East Coast,4.5,2,Cafes,5,29-Dec-19,"Wow! Best service in Singapore! They are so happy here and the food is just lovely. Healthy and bright bold flavors! They also make a mean latte that we loved. The harvest bowl with rice balls was so good! We also loved the avocado toast, the drizzle of herb oil was so yummy."
Hung Kang Teochew Restaurant,4.7,3,Teochew,5,6-Apr-16,"Very good quality.  For a party of five, we ordered the duck, sea cucumber, pork jelly, liver fritter, prawn fritter, cabbage, and yam desserts.  Damage $210  The soy duck slices is thicker then the usual restaurant, but more flavourful. Chewy and provide a good bite to start the meal. The sea cucumber is not spicy although it does look the look, flavour tends to be bland like typical teochew dishes.  My surprise is the pork jelly. Made from bits of the pig head, probably chips of ears and cheek, boiled to jelly and cooled to blocks of jelly and sliced. A teochew delicacy for those with acquired taste.  I like the fritters; deep fried liver wrapped in soya skin, and the prawn fritters. They are probably the strongest in terms of taste.  The cabbage is delightful, and washes down the bowl of rice. Strands of hair-like fungus, lumpy soya dough and mushrooms made this dish too common; a lack of expensive ingredient type of dish.  Dessert of yam and pumpkin is lovely, and sweet water chestnut is refreshing."
Hung Kang Teochew Restaurant,4.7,3,Teochew,4,16-Oct-14,"Ask any teochew, it is unlikely that they don't know Hung Kang. It has been a mainstay traditional teochew restaurant for more years than most can remember.  Food wise, it is a hit and miss these days. Some of the traditional dishes still totally hit the spot but others are not as good as it used to be.  On the most recent visit, we loved the pomfret hot pot with its awesome soup broth, and the oyster porridge. Both dishes I would happily eat again.  Last 0.5 stars is for nostalgia and just for being teochew."
Hung Kang Teochew Restaurant,4.7,3,Teochew,5,7-Nov-12,"This is a mainstay of Teochew cuisine and from experience, I can say it's got the best value-for-money set meals if you come with the entire family.  I've been eating here for years and really love the pomfret (also yummy in a porridge), braised goose and the unbelievably crisp suckling pig (call before to make sure they reserve one for you).  This is not big on ambience but worth a short walk from Raffles Place just for the food.  Spotted: Celebs, top bankers and politicians who dine incognito on the second floor."
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",5,6-May-23,"Thoroughly impressed!  What. My friend and I went and picked a couple of items to try. The salmon was interesting, I think wouldn't say it is the greatest and that I would get it again, probably not. There is better satisfaction from other dishes on the menu. The two rolls were really good. One was the eel roll and the other was floss. Both were very tasty. Also got the curry udon and that was okay okay... was the most excited about the 2 rolls! The chicken bites were also really good  Environment This is in a quite old building, very close to bugis junction and the station. There are a lot of other restaurants inside. The space in the restaurant is quite small.. the ordering is through an iPad so there is no pressure on ordering.  Niceness of the staff Very minimal interactions with the staff but the interaction I encountered was indifferent  Dollar It was a little on the nice side. For me it isn't a daily lunch or dinner.  Yes? I would return to try other items"
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",5,1-Oct-23,"Starting the honeymoon in Singapore with this restaurant being the first stop - it did not disappoint! It's basically an all vegan menu with only some items containing dairy which is noted in the menu. The food was amazing, totally a perfect date night place. Bento Boxes came with a lot of items and was big! It was busy but we got seated right away and the food came quickly. Service was really great, with the tip being automatically added to the receipt. I don't know if all the restaurants are this good out here, but this place sure has set the standard!"
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",4,19-Feb-24,3 Stars Food portion seems to be getting smaller  Uses disposable chopsticks and paper Napkin  Need to walk to the counter to pay your bill  5 Stars Food is delicious  Nice restaurant-style ambiance  Has tablets for you to order directly
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",3,31-Aug-23,"Tiny tables cramped ambiance busy vibe. Many of the dishes aren't vegan, similar to Indian food, they cannot be 'veganised'. Ethical vegans take note  The fortune center it s in has many Buddhist based vegan outlets, you can explore yourself, so herbivores prices don't make it very attractive to vegans."
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",5,14-Oct-19,"Though more on the expensive side, for a vegan Japanese restaurant, it is really good!  I'm not vegan myself but I was open to eating since I heard high praise about this place!  They recommended the unagi roll and man, it was just as good (if not better) than the real thing! But without actual eel! Wow! And the bento we got was about 25SGD but it was ALOT of food and we were able to split it so it was a reasonable price for two people."
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",4,25-Oct-18,"We had family dinner here a couple of times and I'm sure we will be back. The food is well prepared and delicious. If you like Japanese food then you will probably like this restaurant. There is a wide range of dishes from salad, sushi to soba to shabu shabu.  However this place do not serve plain rich except for fried rice. They are quite prompt with the time it took them prepare and serve. We never had to make a reservation for 4 person. They do have the ability to handle larger party of 10-12 but I would suggest you call to avoid disappointment.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant for those who wish to have an even healthier Japanese food."
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",5,7-Aug-17,Agree with the others. Salad (average price of 13-15) are well presented and we'll portioned. Small note is to be careful once hitting the bottom as the sauce can turn a bit on the salty side.
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",5,20-Nov-18,"Loved the vegan fish curry, the texture was meaty and the taste was balanced and delicious. The ramen soups look really good and overall I can say I'm satisfied with the wide array of options this restaurant offers. My only wish would be more deserts, jellies are not that great."
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",3,16-Feb-19,"Spicy ramen (non-dairy) ($13) - 2 stars The noodles were too soft and the mock meat cha shu tasted like some mix between spam and vital wheat gluten mock meat. On the plus side there are mushrooms, corn, a leafy green vegetable and the broth is made from soybean paste without MSG. Not very spicy.  It was pretty crowded on a Friday afternoon but I didn't have to wait to get seated. The unagi sushi looked really good and I also want to try their curry udon and curry katsu!"
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",4,9-Aug-19,"It is one of the best vegan eateries in Singapore, and offers numerous choices of different food. They do use the conventional and readily available meat and seafood alternatives which I'm not too thrilled, but overall their offerings are well crafted. I'm an American and the exchange rate really kills the deal. My lunch was $50 with just 1 soft drinks."
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",4,7-Sep-18,"The food looks amazing and tastes like the real thing, from ramen and udon to katsu curry, unagi sushi, and especially salmon sashimi. It'd be a feat if they could make mock uni. Fun has its price, but you're not going to come here every week, are you?"
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",5,11-Jul-16,"Lovely service, extensive menu, and a great selection of teas. Loved the curry udon and tempura. The avocado in the salad was perfectly ripe, and the seaweed salad was divine. Completely impressed by this little gem."
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",4,14-Sep-14,"We had the Unagi Bento and the Chilled Somen Set  Ambience: Classy with English Jazz Food Presentation: Excellent, just like a japanese restaurant Food: Filling. The mock unagi wasnt close to unagi. Given the crispy edges its closer to grilled fish. Somen was nice but it would be nicer if they allowed us to swap it for the same price cha soba. The saving grace was the fantastic yuzu jelly that came with the bentos. Good place for a casual date."
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",5,28-Oct-12,"Herbivore is a fusion (Japanese-Western) vegetarian restaurant. You would be very surprise how they make vegetarian sashimi, terriyaki meats, fried chicken and many more. I personally am a fan of Japanese food, and I can assure you that these vegetarian style will be unforgettable ones."
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",5,19-Jul-16,Loved this place. Excellent variety for vegetarians. The chili chicken and the cold noodles were great!
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",4,29-Sep-16,"When a restaurant makes a longtime vegan stop and ask if the sashimi really is veg-based, that's how you know it's a well-done meal. I'm used to analogue meats that are very good, but this was my first go with vegetarian sashimi and it was freakishly good. The texture and taste was spot-on, which admittedly was a bit disturbing, but it was tasty. Servings were large, and you order from a tablet attached to the table, which is nice for seeing photos of what you're going to order, but I would have liked to see some descriptions or ability to comment with special requests.  I'm taking away a star because the service wasn't very attentive, and I really wish they labeled the differences between vegetarian or vegan to make it easier for the vegans to order. They have the tablet ordering system, so it would be super convenient to simply have a special request option to ""make it vegan"" without having to grill the server for information. While they don't use eggs, they do use dairy, so you have to make sure to request no sauce/mayo, which is dairy-based."
Herbivore,4.2,17,"Vegetarian, Japanese",2,3-Dec-15,"They have very nice vegetarian food that I am impressed with. However, they have very poor service and did not serve chilli even though requested. Service without a smile.  Will not come back here again."
Stuttgart Blackforest Boutique S-Cafe,4,2,German,5,22-Sep-15,Best Blackforest Cake I had ever tasted!! Melts in your mouth... Yum!!! Cosy and nice ambience... A very good place for a relaxing after dinner desserts ... Especially loves all the Cuckoo Clocks displays...
Stuttgart Blackforest Boutique S-Cafe,4,2,German,3,30-Jan-16,Nice place for German food. Pork knuckle and the special sausage was very good. However the dessert of bread butter pudding was like a pastry maybe the Germans have it like this but I prefer the British pudding. The Apple pie was ok.
Joyden Treasures,4.5,4,Chinese,5,17-Apr-19,"Weekday lunch dim sum buffet is such a great deal, I ended up eating more than my stomach can handle, I suffered from overly full stomach for a while after dining here.  Buffet menu is quite extensive but lacked just a few items I wanted to eat, so we ordered a couple menu items outside the buffet to complete our lunch.  Server kept coming back to refill the tea cup, service here was very attentive.  Food was delicious, my favorite was deep fried fish skin. Some dessert were included in lunch buffet menu, salted egg custard steamed buns and mango something was my favorite. Can't go wrong anything with salted egg or mango.  Be sure to come hungry."
Joyden Treasures,4.5,4,Chinese,5,22-Feb-16,"when my brother first broached the idea of holding my dad's birthday dinner here, i was like joyden who?  but once i yelped it and it was on yelp, i knew it must be legit, right!?  no trepidation walking in as the huge attractive lobster and crab lightbox immediately shouted out my name!  spacious, bright and clean. service was prompt, industrious and their teamwork was evidently effective when faced with a hectic CNY crowd. preferred language is mandarin although working level of english was also demonstrated.  YOU MUST PRE-ORDER THEIR WHOLE SUCKLING PIG!  YOU MUST PRE-ORDER THEIR WHOLE SUCKLING PIG!  YOU MUST PRE-ORDER THEIR WHOLE SUCKLING PIG!  there, i said my piece.  this is probably the best suckling swine that i've had in a while! nose to tail dining? yup, this is the dish! it was gone in a flash! skin as crispy as chips, meat as succulent and flavourful as fats can be.  have you seen those unkempt bee hoon hair that my 1.3kg sri lankan crab was sporting? garlickily laden, slivers of wok hei coated bee hoon soaked in crab roe jus as smooth as brylcreem. easy to get to crab meat that entailed only four fingers' participation. deliciousness, thy name is crab.  the other crustacean worthy of mention here happens to be of the lobster variety. why? because it is married with a beautiful teochew styled porridge so good goldilocks would approve! i put on two kgs eating so much carbs! luckily, the supporting casts were stellar!  and if you must commit fowl play, order their crispy duck! yes, catharina they do a competent crispy duck here! the last quack, did not go unheard.  hashima almond milk for dessert? sure, according to Wikipedia........... hashima is.......... but it's beautifying placebo effect remains a mystery well worth swallowing.  now, i hold my peace."
Joyden Treasures,4.5,4,Chinese,3,22-Apr-16,"Joyden treasures- The 3rd eatery of Joyden Concepts after Joyden Seafood and Joyden Canton. This new concept mainly presents dishes from the past with homemade secret recipes, to rendition heritage taste/ local recipes that many of us may have forgotten. Compared to the other 2 restaurants, Joyden treasures currently holds the biggest space with 6 VIP rooms and more than 200 seats available.  Service staff were attentive and courteous, we were brought to our seats quickly without hestitation. We started off with ordering of drinks and trying out their homemade side dishes.  (1) Iced Apple Hawthorn Tea  - A sourish yet refreshing iced drink to start with. I'm a sour plum drink lover but this was way better! I'm in love with this drink from now. Thank you Cheryl for recommending. Rating 5/5  For mains, we had this pipin' hot and flavourful soup to start:  (2) Double-boiled Seafood Soup in Old Cucumber $14/individual portion  - Melons were specially selected of almost the same size to create this dish. The aroma was so fragrant when served. One sip down my throat and ahhhhhhh, so sweet and comforting. The soup was double-boiled with natural ingredients and seafood such as fish maw, dried scallops, abalone, mushroom, to achieve this kind of rich flavourful soup. Be surprised with a mini pork dumplings right at the bottom of your soup. Rating 5/5  (3) Phoenix Beancurd Skin Prawn Roll ($16s, $22m, $30b)  - Fillings inside were made up of fresh prawns, century egg and salted egg. Hand chopped till minced, wrapped with the beancurd skin then deep fried till crispy. Love the exterior crunchiness of the bean curd skin but would prefer the prawns inside comes in a whole instead of minced. A whole prawn would definitely give a firmer bite and least mushy. Rating 3.5/5  (4) Steamed Red Grouper in Homemade Soy Bean Broth (Market rate. $108 per kilo currently)  - This red grouper was fresh and meat really firm. Natural sweetness of the fish alone was never enough to satisfy my tastebuds whereas I hope to get more out of it. Joyden's method was to cook the fish with soya bean broth freshly made in house, a family recipe, to give this plain fish soya bean fragrance and additional sweetness. Although great efforts were put in but it didn't impressed me, probably because I wasn't a soya bean fan afterall. Fried enoki sprinkled on top wasn't necessary though as they didn't blend in with this fish dish. It would be great as snacks individually. Rating 2/5  (5) Crispy Fragrant Duck with Lotus-shaped Buns ($58 per whole duck)  - Duck was well marinated with chinese spices, slow cooked to boil, then quick fried for the skin to become crispy. The waitress skills to scrap up the duck meat was really good and swift. I took the breast part and it was dry chewing it on its own. Not forgetting the bite-sized homemade buns made fresh daily, they were soft and fluffy too. Wrapped it with the duck meat, cucumber and pickled papaya, add the orangey tangy sweet chilli, it's more yummy. Another alternative way to enjoy the duck was to wrap the duck meat with Joyden's homemade achar. Delicious till max! Rating 3.5/5  (6) Jumbo Prawns in Traditional Dark Sauce ($26s, $36m, $52b)  - Best thing about this dish, wasn't the prawns but the sesame infused gravy. Sweet, savoury fragrant soya sauce gravy that goes really well with a bowl of plain rice. Jumbo prawns tends to be over-cooked causing meat to be hard and tough but these were cooked perfectly. Prawn meat were succulent and crunchy. One piece for each of us was never enough. Rating 5/5  (7) Traditional Salt Baked Crab (Market rate. $63 per kilo currently)  - Various types of salt and spices were wok fried first before applying onto the crab. The seasoned crab was then baked in low temperature till cooked and served as it is in a whole. With all the shell intact, crab meat was firm and not mushy, natural sweetness of the flesh were all locked in. Although the baking process caused some drying out of the flesh but this dish was still savoury. Rating 3.5/5  (8) Malagao ($4.20 per portion)  - These chinese brownies were so soft and pillowy. Look at the air pockets they contained and you can imagine how fluffy they were. Packed with gula melaka fragrance, these squares were so yum and not overly sweet too. A highly recommended item to order if you're here at Joyden. Rating 5/5   (9) Traditional Yam Pur¨¦e ($6 individual portion, $16s, $26m, $36b)  - Yam paste; an all time favourite chinese dessert which my family would definitely order if item was available on the menu. Joyden's version was with steamed pumpkin, ginko nuts, lard, chestnut bits and sugar glazed on top of the yam pur¨¦e. The yam pur¨¦e texture was smooth and creamy with the additional crunch from the chestnuts bits. Not sweet enough in my opinion and lacked aroma. I prefer my yam pur¨¦e with only yam paste and fresh coconut milk. Simplicity was the best! Rating 3/5"
Joyden Treasures,4.5,4,Chinese,5,21-Jan-20,"Crab was really good, and service was amazing! :) We arrived later in the evening hungry, and the service was quick and friendly."
Miyabi Japanese Restaurant,4.5,2,Japanese,5,30-Nov-18,Surprisingly good Japanese food. Would definitely return soon--ordered the salad and it was good stuff -;lucky we went full so there wasn't a need to get mains
Miyabi Japanese Restaurant,4.5,2,Japanese,4,5-Mar-15,"Nice environment, good service, fresh dishes. A fine jap restaurant to consider dining at."
Zhong Hua Steamboat,5,2,Chinese,5,23-Dec-13,"This place is always booming with people whenever I walk past. But was surprised to find many seats available on a Saturday night at 7pm! They don't take reservations so I was pretty excited that we were able to choose our seats! We took a four-persons table inside. Though it got pretty warm after a while, it was still better than outside with all the car fumes.  The spread was pretty decent - lots of vegetable varieties, meat (lean beef, pork, liver, fish, chicken etc), tofu, noodles (bee hoon, yellow noodle, maggie mee etc). The soup selection was good as well. We order half chicken herbal soup and laksa soup. We heard that the laksa soup was awesome and we weren't disappointed! The laksa gravy was the right texture (not too diluted or thick) and had delicious bits of dried shrimp in it (hae bee hiam)  There were also some hot food selections but I didn't try those. Noticed that the other patrons were busily cooking their food and neglected the hot food. Dessert collection was non-existent. Fruits were available and drinks was free flow!  At a reasonable price of $19.90++ on Fri-Sun and $18.90++ on all other days, it is really worth it.  *Note: Place gets crowded from around 7.30pm onwards when everyone starts to walk in. There is a queue from 8.30pm onwards."
Shanghai Ren Jia,4.3,14,Chinese,5,11-Feb-23,"Not your regular Chinese restaurant, this place is packed with authentic Shanghainese dishes. Even an order of egg rolls would surprise and impress you. Yeah, start with that and the drunken chicken. You can't be wrong with that!"
Shanghai Ren Jia,4.3,14,Chinese,4,15-Dec-20,The signature dumplings were excellent. Hot soup within the dumpling even though the dough was a little heavy. The vegs were Done just right and very tasty! The deep fried spring rolls were oily and dripping with oil but the insides were exquisite Perhaps they should clean up the oil from the spring rolls before serving to make the meal a5 star experience instead of 4. The place is tiny so reservations are necessary especially during covid times.
Shanghai Ren Jia,4.3,14,Chinese,5,8-Nov-15,"This place is amazing! It's heaven on earth! I can't believe that I haven't tried this place until today.  The restaurant is managed by a husband and wife team. The wife sources the ingredients and personally flies to China to get the best things there. She's very passionate and believes that people should only have healthy and good food. She also doesn't take any short cut. There are some ingredient that you can get easily from the factories, but she refuses to do that.  I think I can go on and on about their cooking philosophy. Let's just say, you need to try the food yourself.  Xiao Long Bao- very powerful soup. No need extra sauce or ginger.  Hand made noodle- the texture is amazing. The best I have tried.  Pork buns- she flies to China to source for the best salted veggie used in this item. The sauce, bun, and pork can send you to heaven.  The veggie- I was initially skeptical about this dish. How can a super green simple dish be so good. I'm so used to having veggies cooked with garlic or chillis. But, this simple dish blew me away. It was delicious.  I'm already counting down to my next visit to try their other items. Do make a booking though. They can get really busy and it takes awhile to get the items. My advice is don't rush through the food. Enjoy every dish."
Shanghai Ren Jia,4.3,14,Chinese,5,17-Jan-18,Love this place! It's truly a gem of a find and a super yummy hole in the wall. Haven't had anything I didn't like yet Xiao Long Bao and the Pork Buns are to die for
Shanghai Ren Jia,4.3,14,Chinese,5,8-Apr-18,"After a long day of seeing the sights as a tourist, I found this wonderful restaurant features in a blog post (many thanks to ieatishootipost) and decided to give it a shot. It ended up being the best decision I made all day. After taking a quick trip to the ATM around the corner (cash only), we ordered xiao long bao, pan-fried buns, chicken mushroom noodles, sauteed pea shoots, and pan-fried dumplings. Everything was phenomenal!  Our favorites were definitely the xiao long bao and buns. The flavor of the meat is just right and absolutely mouth-watering, and the soup is a perfectly spiced complement. The buns were fluffy with a perfectly crisped, not-greasy bottom and completed by the juicy and savory filling. At home, we eat at Din Tai Fung pretty regularly, and this was way better! Everything else was superb, too!  We were especially thankful for the warm hospitality from the couple that own and run the place and their son (who speaks good English). They were very kind and clearly put a lot of time, effort, and love into the food they serve! We wish we could come visit more often!"
Shanghai Ren Jia,4.3,14,Chinese,3,14-Sep-12,"Sheng jian bao is the thing to eat here. not many places serve it. Their version is great. Crispy at the bottom and nice and fluffy on top.  rest of the items are ok, but the wait can get so so long!"
Shanghai Ren Jia,4.3,14,Chinese,4,3-Nov-12,"Authentic and homely, this is what Shanghai Ren Jia offers. A very sweet Shanghainese couple who came to Singapore almost a decade ago opened this humble restaurant to make a simple living by doing what they do best - cook.  As everything is freshly prepared only after you order, waiting time can be a little long but you can be assured that it's worth the while cos the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow is truly a real treasure. ;)  Personally love their xiao long bao and their cong you mian (hand made noodles with shallot oil) is a great staple! Of course the si ji dou and zui ji (drunken chicken) are other authentic shanghainese dishes that are not to be missed.  Cos the restaurant is a very small set up, walk-ins may find it hard to get a table during peak dinner time so it's always better to just call and make a reservation. To keep the waiting time shorter, you can also pre-order your dishes so that they can prep the ingredients prior ensure prompt serving upon your arrival."
Shanghai Ren Jia,4.3,14,Chinese,4,5-Jun-15,"The dishes are delicious if you enjoy rich heavy flavored. However if you think you can fill up your tummy, then you'll have to order lots of dishes. This is because all dishes are small. The steam dumplings are only 5 to a basket. So for 2 persons, you'll need to get 2 baskets. We also ordered the fried buns which are very delicious, together with Shanghai wanton soup, braised pork noodles. The prices are reasonable but the stir-fried dou Miao is rather pricey at $12 for a small plate. Both of us paid $44 for 4 dishes and tea. A rather reasonable deal."
Shanghai Ren Jia,4.3,14,Chinese,4,7-Dec-16,"This modest little eatery located at the base of a generic HDB block is a real gem. The place is small, so call ahead to reserve if you've a big group of diners. And if you have a big group, order everything on the menu in multiples because the portions are small too. The cooking here is quite refined although the menu is small and prices are reasonable. I'd recommend the xiaolongbao, the shen jian bao and the shanghai spring rolls. The xiaolongbao has a lovely sweet soup and the skin is delicate enough to not result in a doughy knot at the top but strong enough to withstand a chopstick grip from basket to plate. The shen jian bao has a tasty meat filling but it is the crunchy bottom, covered in a layer of nutty seeds, that makes this a win. The Shanghai spring rolls are deep fried a la minute, and comes to the table atomically crispy, with skins that shatter satisfyingly with each bite. The filling is shredded cabbage instead of the local turnip version. The drunken chicken is very fragrant with the wine and silky in texture. Also good is the braised pork belly with sweet mei cai, unctuous and melt in your mouth. As for the vegetable options, the french beans are crisp and surprisingly spicy. But for me, it is a photo finish between the wild rice stems and the chives in egg. This is the only place where I've ever seen wild rice stems - they taste like a more delicate version of lily buds. The chives are cooked in a creamy scrambled egg and superb. There are two dessert options but I'd advise a miss. Expend your calories on the main dishes as they are the star of the show and really worthwhile. The only quibbles I have with this place is that it can get really noisy as it is small and full of hard surfaces that bounce sound around. And the chef-owner can sometimes be a tad temperamental. Do not make the mistake of asking for vinegar and ginger with your xiaolongbao because he will lecture you on how that is the crutch of restaurants who do not know how to make a flavourful xiaolongbao. I've seen him do that to other hapless diners before. So be warned!"
Shanghai Ren Jia,4.3,14,Chinese,5,21-Dec-14,Amazing food. Each dish is made to perfection and tastes like it has no equals.  Each year we come to Singapore we make sure to stop by and enjoy the wonderful food. The worst part is you are so full you can't have anymore!
Shanghai Ren Jia,4.3,14,Chinese,5,1-Nov-15,"Authentic Shanghai food and chef personally came out to greet us, explained to us the dishes and gave us recommendations"
Shanghai Ren Jia,4.3,14,Chinese,3,12-Sep-15,Remember to make a reservation if you don't want to be disappointed! They have nice drunken chicken and noodle dishes...but be prepared to wait!
Shanghai Ren Jia,4.3,14,Chinese,3,7-Jul-13,"Was surprised to find a full dining restaurant with ac and modern interior under a non-descript HBD complex, just around the corner of a hawker center. Try the fried pau, noodle with pork, and omelet with chives. The fried pau is great, crispy on the outside, with soup and meat inside! The handmade noodle was very smooth and springy, while the omelet was simple and worked very well with the chives. The meal comes with a big jug of hot chrysanthemum tea. The waitress also mentioned that the spring roll and xiao long bao are also the top-selling items, but we were too full to try them, so those were for the next time."
Shanghai Ren Jia,4.3,14,Chinese,5,15-Aug-15,Very cozy restaurant. Food is very good. As I Shanghainese I miss the food from my hometown very much. Now I have this place to go!!
Ji Ji Wanton Noodle Specialist,4.5,8,Chinese,5,13-Apr-24,Definitely worth the wait! I got their signature bowl and there was a variety of flavors and textures. The dumplings were super soft and the char siu had a nice sweet taste. The broth on the side was also amazing.
Ji Ji Wanton Noodle Specialist,4.5,8,Chinese,5,17-Feb-23,"There is a reason why this wanton noodle soup has earned Michelin guide stars since 2016! I came on a weekday around 10am and there was already a line. I waited about 25 minutes for my turn. I got the #1, Ji Ji signature char siew wantan noodle - $4.50 SGD with a side of braised chicken feet - $4 SGD. I'm glad I ordered a small but then I'm also sad I didn't order a large because it was so yummy! It was a filling meal. The chicken feet side came with 6! That's more than what you get at a dim sum restaurant here in North America! Everything was so flavorful. It was just 2 people working, I assumed the younger lady was also the owner. The sweetest lady you'll ever meet. Very friendly. She asked. ""how come you don't want chili? When in Singapore you got to have chili."" I'm so glad I listened, it was so delicious with the noodles. A must have at this hawker center. It's located on the 2nd floor. I also like she has a change machine. So if you need help breaking a large bill, this is the place to do it."
Ji Ji Wanton Noodle Specialist,4.5,8,Chinese,5,13-Nov-22,"This place not it's 6th year in a row for Michelin guide winner and I can see why. It's soooo good. There a ee a variety of different wantan mee you can choose from but we went with the signature dish - small version. You must get their sambal as well it's sooo good. The first look at the bowl, I wasn't impressed, it looks tiny and not really anything to write home about. However, once you mixed up the bowl, you can see there's tons of noodles in there, making it a very filling meal. Oh and as you eat, you realize there's also a ton of charsiu. I was like ' why are there more and more char SIU??' lol. The I love the complexity of the flavors and texture in this dish. The side broth was also very good, it changes each time you eat it with something from the noodle bowl. And for $S4.50, it was amazing."
Ji Ji Wanton Noodle Specialist,4.5,8,Chinese,4,28-Dec-21,"Ji Ji Noodle House is one of the food stalls that you must patronise if you are at Hong Lim Food Complex. This is also one of the stalls recommended by Michelin Guide.  They occupy 2 shop spaces side by side in the hawker centre with one side as storage and the other as ordering area.  Even on a Saturday morning, the queue was overwhelmed. It took us about 30 minutes to get the order.  We have Fried Chicken Cutlet to share among ourselves. Frying to golden brown in its crispy skin and coated with some chilli sauce.  The meat was both juicy and tender.  There are numerous dishes on their menu and one of the popular ones will be their Signature Noodle. Their noodles are sold at 4 prices $4.50 / 5.50 / 6.50 / 8.50. The bowl of Signature noodles was generously loaded with ingredients like Char Siew Slices, minced pork, braised mushrooms, wantons, pork lard as well as greens.  I was swept away by how flavourful and by its piquant taste when I had the first mouthful. It has a unique fragrant that was not commonly found in normal hawker noodles on top of those pork lard bits. Texture of the noodle is springy too.  There are a number of fried wantons as well as the normally boiled wantons. The fried ones were good with their thin and crispy skin.  Char Siew was tender and great pairing with the noodle sauces.  Not only was the food above average, the lady who serves the customers was friendly despite a busy queue ahead. I don't mind going back again for great service and food."
Ji Ji Wanton Noodle Specialist,4.5,8,Chinese,5,4-Nov-20,"Excellent old school Sui Gao (dumpling) noodle. The 3 dumplings are large (as they ought to be) and have ample minced pork filling with detectable fresh shrimp and water chestnut. Slightly thicker type noodles were cooked just right. The sauce is slightly sweet but balanced by the perfectly portioned green yu choy, mushroom slices and crispy pork lard. The accompanied dark chilli sauce is well made and should be mixed into the noodles to lessen its sweetness. A satisfying Michelin Plate for $4.50."
Ji Ji Wanton Noodle Specialist,4.5,8,Chinese,4,4-Mar-16,"This have been one of my favorite wanton noodles stall. I have been avoiding it becos the taste is so good and it's almost addictive.  The regular must have know the huge amount of pork lard hidden, chopped so small yet crunchy, so small that I cannot seem to find them to remove them. This ""hidden"" secret naturally add to the tastiness.  I had the Dumplings version of the noodles. The dumpling probably didn't get to soak cooked long enough becos it like almost solid hardness for dumplings. The prawns embedded in these jello rocks is fresh and crunchy. The mushrooms in the sauce, and the sauce liberally soaking the noodles is probably the other secret. Now I remember that they don't clip off the stems of the mushrooms. Those stems are hard to chew, probably cause a few people to dislocate their dentures.  The texture of the noodles is probably not as chewy as the other famous wanton noodle place, but when all the above combined the noodles dish itself taste wonderful.  They lost one star for the dumpling, which I am pretty sure if they had less Q, this problem disappears.  I won't return too much since I cannot remove those tasty pork lard crunchy crumbs."
Ji Ji Wanton Noodle Specialist,4.5,8,Chinese,4,26-Jul-16,Read about its wanton noodles and I decided to give it a try as I'm in the neighbourhood. Definitely not the food-court-taste wanton noodles. I had the char siew wanton and added the fried wantons for extra dollar.
Ji Ji Wanton Noodle Specialist,4.5,8,Chinese,4,23-Oct-12,"Dropped in on a busy Sunday at lunchtime, and this double stall caught my eye because it is nice and colourful with lots of awards on it. Ordered up the large wonton noodles for $5 and overall it was very good. As others have said, the portions are large and the ingredients go beyond what other stalls offer.  In the dish there were two types of wontons - fried (which were average) and boiled pork with prawns (which were amazing). There is also some Chinese cabbage and mushrooms which were a nice touch. The biggest downside was the noodles, seriously they need to improve the quality of these - just tasted wrong. Lastly, the sauce was a bit terrible, it wasn't a soup-style dredging of it which is good. Next time, go with the boiled wontons, extra vegetables and less of everything else."
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,5-Dec-22,"I came here via train for dinner on a Sunday evening in early December 2022. It was very easy to get a reservation. I booked my reservation the day before. The entire time I was there from 6:30PM through 8:30PM, I only saw two other parties come after me.  The food was very good. Each dish was beautiful and truly unique. It was a six-course pre fixe menu and they said they change the menu every month. Each course came with a note card explaining the chef's inspiration and through process of the dish. They even packaged them up and gave them to you afterwards - quite unique.  The courses were perfectly portioned but I had trouble finishing the final main course (the 5th dish). The 6th course which we the dessert course was overwhelming in a good way. They brought out 3 different dishes but I was only able to take a bite out of each. I would highly recommend."
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,14-Dec-22,"Such a beautiful restaurant inside the Botanical Garden. Pricey, but a great experience. After orders were placed and they brought out the amuse bouche and the bread. I just knew the meal would be phenomenal. I would have been happy just eating the delicious, light, and fluffy rolls. For me... once house made fresh bread is served, I'm hooked to be thinking the rest of the meal will be awesome, and it really was. Great attention to details and quality. I loved everything in the whole meal. Such beautifully plated dishes. The staff is friendly and attentive."
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,3,3-Jul-22,Great environment with interesting dishes! Nice to walk around the garden after the meal.
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,24-Feb-19,"Came here for the lunch tasting menu since it was a bit cheaper than dinner.  Coming in here they start you off with some bread and nicely whipped butter. Need less to say that it was amazing. The tasting menu consisted of Amuse bouche, carabinero prawns, New Zealand Blue Cod (crispy scales), Wagyu beef cheek, Japanese chestnut.  The amuse bouche that was served to us was a leech bubble bursting with a delicate cold sweetness and a shrimp cracker with some roe. The former is a little bit sweeter but then the latter is more savory, so definitely eat in that order. We then had these prawns and wow that was amazing. The spot prawns were cooked sashimi style and served in this amazing bed of fruits and vegetables. It was such a light dish that had so much going on (sweetness, acidic, multiple textures) and I loved this dish. I found myself finishing all the dressing as well since it was just so perfect and really maximized the freshness of the spot prawns. It came with some squid ink rice crackers so really let you get a very delectable bite.  Next come the entrees, and IMO the absolute star of the show: the cod with fried skin. They leave the scales on and deep fry that!!!! I have never had this in my life, but omg if this wasn't the best cod I've had in my life. Step one, the meat is obviously cooked to perfection. Not too tough as to be overcooked, and not too soft where it's a bit raw, just perfect. But that is tablestakes, the jewel was the skin. The scales all popped up and was sprinkled with a generous amount of sea salt and a bite into the skin just felt like you were tasting this fish straight from the ocean with all it's saltiness. It was amazing. The texture was so crispy and it didn't leak to the tender meat below.  The beef wagyu cheek was probably the best cheek I've had. That being said though, I'm not sure if I love cheek that much. The texture of cheek is traditionally chewy, and here it was fattier and much more tender than I'm used to. It almost tasted like other parts of wagyu (flank for example), but I would've just preferred normal ribeye wagyu. I appreciate the quality and skill here and I feel it's like showcasing a more forgotten piece of steak, I would just rather have the wagyu ribeye though.  The dessert left a little to be desired. There was some alchohol flavor in the sauce and the dish was good, just nothing too special here.  All in all, it was a great meal and came out to be S$230 after tip and taxes for two. I think the price point is pretty spot on and I would come back. It's not a bargain by any means, but not a rip off either."
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,4,19-Feb-19,"I tried the chef's choice 5 meal courses for S$158.00. It was very beautiful sophisticated presentation. Wagyu dishes was over flavored. Don't really taste wagyu itself flavor. Black truffle was on the one of the dishes. When I bite it, I expect to smell the great fragrance of truffle but did not. So if you like to eat the dishes respect the natural flavor of the material, then probably this restaurant is not the one. This restaurant is Michelin One star restaurant. I would recommend the 3 meal or 4 meal courses. Cheaper and enjoy the pretty building and pretty dishes."
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,9-Oct-19,"Great food and excellent decor. Definitely should check it out.  There's not a lot else to write, but I have to fill space so here's some words. Please dont moderate me yelp!"
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,19-Aug-21,"Since the start of Covid, I had not had the chance or mood to sample the culinary delights in Singapore. So when the authorities finally opened up, what hopefully will be a permanent easing of dining establishments, my family decided to celebrate and killed 2 birds by celebrating my birthday at Corner House located at the Botanic Gardens. The establishment has had a long history of providing gastronomical delights for their guests, having earned a Michelin star. We had been there before and were never disappointed. This time we wanted to sample a new menu by chef David Thien. We decided on their lunch menu comprising 5 and 6 courses that the waiters refused to give us any information on other than that it would be a surprise. The only question was if there were any items that the diners could/would not eat. Speaking of the waiters, the service was, as expected excellent. Nothing pretentious mind you, nor overly friendly. Just professional, polite friendly and gracious. We felt pampered. Now to the food. Every course was preceded with a beautifully decorated card explaining chef's inspirations and thoughts on the dish. The servers presented the dishes and explained its components as well as in some cases the best way to eat them to maximize enjoyment. All the dishes were beautifully presented so that even diners with OCD would be happy as each component, decoration, flowers, gold foil were precisely positioned for maximum visual delight. Likewise eating the food was a sensory extravaganza. The meal was truly an experience. The food is described as ""French Asian"" which frankly always makes my heart beat a little faster. It is enormously difficult to make it work. Too little or wrong As¨ªan and the dish will feel as if it was a French dish with just a hint of spice to make it ""Asian"". Too much and the Asian flavors will overwhelm the subtle French flavors. But like Goldilocks, David found the ""just right"". More so, the Asian influences complimented and enhanced the French so as to make the sum greater than the individual parts. It is really really difficult to do that and in my opinion David succeeded. Of course all things can be improved, but it will be just niggardly of me to point them out. In respect to Chef David, I'll not show many pictures of the meal. Just 2 items, to whet your appetite. Go there for a great meal for a special occasion with someone special. You will not be disappointing."
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,1-Jan-15,"The corner house restaurant is a converted bungalow in the botanical gardens. As such its location Is quaint and very beautiful. Service is attentive and very professional. The food is excellent. Each course was sublime, carefully prepared and presented as a piece of art. As expected its pricy. Perfect for that special occasion. Very romantic. A great place for couples to pop the question. The chicken was one of their signature dishes. Deceptively simple but the breast was brined and sous verde. The cooking and preparation method ensured that it was tender and succulent with the brine intensifying the flavor. The dark meat was brined and pan fried. 2 methods, very different and went well in contrast."
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,4,28-Apr-18,"A huge splurge for a brilliant meal in the heart of Singapore's Botanical Gardens. Impeccable service - my love of this restaurant is skewed by the incredible amuse bouche and a single petit four.  The Salted Egg Macaroons. My god. These might be one of the best things I have ever eaten. They melt on your tongue, leaving a cacophony of flavour. If there's a peak for Singapore's salted egg obsession, this is it.  But truth be told - the rest of the meal was a mix of the innovative and unexciting. The asparagus was quite plain. The gariguette strawberry quickly became an unrecognisable mix of fruit flavours. The crispy cod, though, was perfection and use of frozen creme fraiche exciting.  The venue is beautiful, and the service impeccable. Even if dinner (plus three house wines between four) cost a hefty $400 sgd, it was an evening to remember."
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,4,29-Aug-21,Covid-19 has certainly affected "fine-dining". I take every opportunity these days to bring the family or at least my wife out to enjoy the finer things in life. Never know when the government will tighten dinning out again. This is one of my favourite place for nice relaxing ambiance and good food. Highly recommended!
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,4,19-Jun-17,"I was taken here for a belated birthday lunch on a Saturday afternoon. The restaurant is situated in the Botanic Gardens, and you may want to look up on how to get there, because the garden is quite... large.  I find the food here generally technically competent, with flavor pairings quite fresh, and a fusion of French and a teensy bit of Modsin, which I really enjoy. The Modsin here doesn't go too far, and instead teases the diner here and there.  I had the: Amuse bouche, prawn cracker and oyster leaf Nothing to shout about, nice and crunchy  Carabinero prawn with tomatoes I would have loved to eat this with a local prawn, but carabinero works too. Red on red, went very well.  Foie gras Mousse I loved the petal garnish, but also well-executed, nothing extraordinary.  Cod with crispy scales This, I loved. I have not eaten such crispy scales, with no hint of oil, and such a harmonious balance with the cod and the sauce. Also, very aesthetically pleasing.  Wagyu Well-executed, with a delicious onion... thing. My friend doesn't eat beef so they swapped it out with pork.  Durian bread and butter pudding I felt the durian could have been stronger, but overall, very tasty, and sweet.  Petit fours Salted egg macarons were yum, though the salted egg could have been heavier. Chocs were, well, good.  I love this place for their aesthetically pleasing food, and its modsin influence. I do feel it could be better by being a bit more daring. The food here is really technically competent, but could utilize more local produce. Love!"
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,28-Apr-19,Michelin restaurant tucked in the Singapore Botanical gardens - such a wonderful surprise and delightful food experience. Nicely air-conditioned but not cold. The courses were timed perfectly and each so yummy. We never expected to have such a beautiful and tasty meal while exploring a garden. We enjoyed every course of the meal!
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,15-Jun-16,"Totally a restaurant that caught me off guard - one that I saved towards the end of my SG upper tier restaurant binge. Highly recommended in every regard - setting, service, food, and creativity.  My girlfriend and I made a Sunday dinner reservation where, quite frankly, I was expecting a typical French fusion restaurant that I see all over NYC, London, etc but there has to be a reason that it is Top 50 in Asia (even though the list is totally hit or miss). We arrived at the drop off location (after a short period of getting lost - Make sure you go to the Nassim Gate location which is at Nassim Road and Cluny Road. Google Maps took us to the other side of the Botanic Gardens at Corner House Gate which is the service entrance), pretty cool to have a buggy waiting and greeting you by name for the short ride to the restaurant.  We sat down at a beautiful corner table and were immediately served with champagne followed with the menu. We opted for the dinner Discovery tasting menu which was a well portioned 8 course experience (see image). Afterwards we were presented the wine menu which was extremely French heavy and what I thought was a very expensive list. We did a nice bottle of Hermitage.  I LOVE restaurants that exceed expectations by a long shot. Every menu option was just...WOW. Not a single course that wasn't to my liking on top of the level of artistry in each. The specific items that blew my mind were the ""Interpretation of my favorite vegetables"" which was a few different snacks using onion, each of which were surprisingly fantastic. Would you ever think an onion tea would be appetizing? IT WAS!! Or onion with truffle or dried onion slices? SO GOOD!! Also was the ""Chef Jason's botanica"" which was simply an art piece. Should be in a museum somewhere. Lastly was his ""My favorite childhood food memory"" dessert with meringue crackers, homemade pandan kaya and toasted bread - which was totally out of this world. Anytime a top tier fusion restaurant includes local cuisine so prominently in their cooking, I get happy.  Service was impeccable. The waiters were all very kind and friendly, not a single ounce of stuffiness or pretentiousness that you might see at other restaurants of this caliber. To add the final touch of perfection, Jason Tan himself greeted us and bid us farewell as we finished our visit.  Easily part of the top 5 favorite restaurants in all of Asia. Highly recommend if on a date with someone special (you are in the Singapore Botanic Gardens after all), a beautiful nice family dinner or a group get together!"
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,25-Aug-16,"Truly deserves the Michelin Star!! Had gone there for their business lunch, 3 course menu. I think that's the most value for money way to try out the place. Its in an excellent location in the botanical gardens. Their food is a work of art! I had the foie grais, toothfish and the chef's interpretation of kaya toast. Everything was spectacular and amazing in taste. Highly recommended if you are celebrating a special occasion or just want to treat yourself to a great meal!"
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,26-May-19,"Food is so amazing. We were a small group and we were all enthusiastic about our dining experience. The (celebrity) chef came out at the end, I can only imagine how much effort and passion go into his dishes, really a lot of work and attention to all details. Can't recommend anything in particular as most was excellent. Wagu beef, lobster, desserts.. Nice"
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,3,22-Dec-17,"Short review: gourmet hawker center.  Long review: Food is creative but not exhilarating. Ambiance is typical and very short of special. Hype is overwhelming with Michelin accolades and table scarcity. You can spend $300pp much more wisely than eating here.  Biggest disappointments include uneven table lighting which led to many dark spots and light spots creating unnecessary contrast (no photo pictures because of this), lack of intimacy (group table in the main dining room was extremely loud and shouting across from each other like it was a drunk wedding, which the waitstaff did nothing to help the other annoyed patrons wishing for a quiet dinner), overall casual atmosphere (T-shirt's and crocs allowed).  I would have felt a lot better about this place if people felt compelled to treat this place like a formal restaurant rather than a hawker center. Don't bother dressing nicely, because you will certainly be overdressed. With that in mind, this is a restaurant not worthy of a special occasion. Instead, go here to kick off a hen or stag party if you're keen on dropping $300-400 per person."
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,6-Feb-16,"Fabulous food, one of the best meals I've had in Singapore. Great flavours and combinations.  Service was excellent, in total contrast to some other local establishments (*cough* NeonPigeon).  The brevity of this review doesn't do the place justice - just go.  And make sure you order the melt-in-your-mouth beef."
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,6-Jul-15,"I'm so fond of this restaurant and it's got so much to do with the exceptional service they offered during our anniversary dinner. My heel broke as I was getting out of the taxi and I carried my shoes to the entrance of the restaurant and asked if the had some tape or a stapler so I could perform surgery on my shoe. The hostess took my shoe and told me to have a seat. She fixed it in 5 minutes so I could climb the stairs to our table. She was so sweet and really added to the memory of our first anniversary. I'm so thankful for her!  Now to what I know most of you care about shoe repair--food! The menu was rather concise. They offered the chefs tasting meal which had multiple choices for $248 per person or a more limited menu for $98 per person that included fewer items. We started with a wonderful bottle of Riesling for $100.  Please see my photos for more information on our meal, which was absolutely delightful. Everything was prepared perfectly. The textures and flavors blended perfectly and the service was phenomenal. This place is great for a special occasion, anniversary or birthday. It's not very Paleo-friendly, but it's definitely worth the cheat!"
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,4,27-Apr-15,"not to be mistaken for chubby hubby is chef jason tan, helming a once historic and now culinary house that has seen the likes of au jardin les amis. the team under him, though a little unpolished, will certainly shine in due course. sophia, hope i got her name right, deserves special mention for her impeccable service.  the one thing that you should never pass on here, has to be the breads! the walnut bread, classic french baguette and if you are lucky, his version of ham chee peng were all BRILLIANT. whoever the bakery genius is behind those delicately delicious dough deserves a pay rise immediately! but do limit yourself to only one serving of each and save room for the gastronomical journey that awaits.  after your sinful carbo loading jump start comes a plethora of amuse bouche, that is if you are having the discovery menu, that will further convince you that you have come to the right house! the play on taste, colour and texture awakens and heightens your senses in preparation for the courses that follow.  the highlights from the discovery menu has to be chef jason's 'botanica', a curation of botanicals in a variety of preparations. it is like fifty shades of vegetables in different doneness, acidity, hue and texture. you will never look at a vegetarian dish in the same way again after consuming this artistically assembled selection of fibrous produce.  and just when you thought you have seen it all, another humble vegetable, a favourite of jason's is presented for you to eat in 4 ways! the oignon doux des c¨¦vennes interpreted and transformed into a confit on crispy filo pastry, a dehydrated thinly sliced onion, a whole baked onion with sous vide egg and truffle and finally as an emulsion with earl grey infused onion tea. hey, this man knows, likes his vegetables and you will too!  all before led me to the highest crescendo but alas two of three subsequent dishes, that i will single out, send me crashing rock bottom. the cod with crispy scales was overcooked, cold and bland. the bresse pigeon was by far the worst dish of the night! superlatively gamey and way bloodily undercooked! the accompanying foie gras was obviously of the duck variety and tasted as such, quite unpalatable.  is this becoming like a roller coaster ride? can his desserts save him? the answer is a resounding yes! especially memorable were the salted egg macaron and the jackfruit mochi. jason is definitely creative and these happy endings led me to give corner house a second chance.  and that second chance came in the form of citibank's $100 gourmet with swedish guest chef niklas ekstedt. redemption time? yes! the pacing could have been a little better but somewhat understandable as they were running at full house. am not sure if chef niklas upped jason's game but no fowl play today, hooray! this time around, jason's free range chicken dish was licked cleaned and a five star upgrade from the inedible bresse pigeon dish that bombed so badly in the mouth. his other solo effort was the scallop dish and again it showed that the overcooked cod might have been just a one off letdown.  having said that, consistency is of the essence when it comes to dishing out michelin stars. and the fifth from me will be awarded when consistency is achieved."
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,27-Aug-14,"The 2-storey restaurant sets the mood for ""exquisite eating"" which I didn't hesitate to replace the word for appropriateness. Instead, fine-dining is far too distant from my experience for which the place is less intimidating but harbor a sense of friendliness and a perfect spot for a daytime botanical meal.  The lunch is a quick meal intended with no fuss selection except for a top-up if you want a Riso pasta or a Kaya Toast as dessert. A 3-course is priced at $38++ while you may go for a Luncheon Discovery menu which offers a 5-course at $88++ when you have a more generous lunch hour.  We were led to our table swiftly and they were very attentive to our needs. We were given amble time to decide on our choices and we were brief on the idea behind the dishes and the assembles on our plate each time we were served. That's the whole service I give honor to as I care extensively about what I eat and how they flavored my dining exposure.  They came around with a bread basket piling with fresh baguette and wholegrain slices for you to pick out. I was look forward to the small heap of Yves Bordier French butter - very rich and creamy. Like we did, sprinkle a few sea salt flakes on your buttered bread and bon app¨¦tit!  We were presented with the Marinated Norwegian Salmon Trout for a start. I am not a big fan of any cured fish except for certain meat. Nevertheless, the teaser wasn't a turn off but was quite lovely given a gentle sweet hint in the creme sauce underneath the bed of salad pyramid with onions, celery strips while the petit flying fish roe went popping in my mouth. The salmon is nice without a fishy note, very nicely cured.  I had the free range chicken instead of the Riso Pasta (supplement of $8), the latter reminds me of Orzo pasta which I once had at The Waterfall Cafe and am still liking it. I didn't want too much carbs so the chicken dish appeals to me. The Free Range Chicken has a very fine texture, baby tender like a juvenile. The skin is lightly pan-seared although its thick fatty tissue is somewhat freaking me out. Jason uses a mix of white and yellow corn kernels for the key flavor which heightens the taste a notch further with natural sweetness. The foam like I guess was supposedly the poultry emulsion patterning the plate.  I tasted the impressive ""The interpretation of Kaya Toast"" (supplement of $8) and was feeling complete! The taste of Gula Melaka has made a strong statement in the dessert while the pandan scent has went into hidding. I love the intensity of the coconut palm sugar, mirroring the chendol we once knew. The muscovaldo sand bits adds bites to the cream along with the citrus element in the yuzu sorbet - heavenly match.  Alternatively, you may choose to go with the Soursoup Sorbet which is no inferior than the kaya toast. It has a smooth texture with a robust Soursoup accent that arrived with a sweet indication. Not overly nectarous when accompanied by a bed of Morello cherry compote. The pretty-looking meringue extends a light crunch to the frictionless construction. It gives you a soft and dainty closure to your afternoon meal. However if you adore a loud booming ending, go for the kaya toast which conferred a long lasting impression as it did on me.  Oh they have free buggy service, ring them up and check on the pick up within the botanic garden.  Bon appetit, yelpers!!!"
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,21-Aug-17,"The entire experience at Corner House really deserves 4.5 stars but because of the amazing food, they got bumped up to 5.  We had the Discovery Menu, and highly recommend it. The onion prepared four ways remains one of the most memorable dishes we have had to date.  All waitstaff professional and friendly, we met the Chef who is such a humble guy. A really wonderful restaurant all round, we'll be sure to be back again and again"
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,17-Jun-18,"We came to Corner House for dinner on our second night in town. The restaurant itself is within Singapore Botanical Gardens, but even though we came after the gardens had closed and the sun was setting, there are clear signs from the taxi dropoff to direct you to Corner House without much trouble. Once there, you are escorted up the stairs into the main dining area. There are different sections to it, given the older colonial nature of the building, but the finishes are modern and refined like much of the city-state itself. One of the standouts for sure, alongside the decor, is the general ambiance and the plateware in particular - it has the feeling of a high-end restaurant but comes off as more relaxing (thanks to the temperature here, no one shows up in the more formal dress I would expect to see at a European or American Michelin-starred restaurant), but the design and thoughtfulness of the food presentation is evident. Drinks are limited to an extensive selection of wines; I stuck with a glass of white and red for the meal itself, both of which were quite good. As for service, I found it a bit more attentive than Candlenut (from the previous night), but in a similar fashion, it was not overly personalized either.  In a similar vein, what was listed on our tasting menu was exactly what we got - no deviation or extra surprises along the way. While there are other menu options if you don't come over the weekend, you only have the option of the tasting menu otherwise (we were there Sunday). You get 9 courses, but two of those are the amuse bouche and the petit fours, so it is a bit more of a compressed tasting menu than I was expecting to have. That said, I felt that every dish was very strong as a result - it certainly seemed that the chef and their staff were able to focus on making each dish as good as possible. The amuse bouche to start off were mostly small bites and served in an interesting fashion - our fish skin chips with trout roe were served atop a bed of small pebble. My favorite of the amuse bouche round was the last dish presented, which was an excellent raw shrimp dish served with cucumbers and a lime-infused broth - simple and refreshing. We moved onto more seafood that was excellently prepared. The scallop dish was served cool and with dry ice, and combined with the yuzu, was fresh, and the geoduck clam that came next was served with a generous amount of sliced clam and pasta - making it a bit of an Italian-inspired dish that focused mainly on showcasing the seafood flavors instead of being doused with sauce. The white asparagus dish was a nice respite from the rest of the meal - the only vegetarian course outside of dessert - but a bit more restrained from a flavor perspective. The highlight was definitely the blue cod, which was served with the scales of the skin crisped, mixing the succulence of the fish fillet with the saltiness and crunchy texture of the skin...definitely one of the most beautiful-looking fish dishes I have eaten (and gorgeously presented to boot). The wagyu was presented on a mostly empty slate plate, but it was quite delicious (although it could have been cooked a tad more - the middle was too rare for my liking). We finished up the meal with a fantastic serving of French strawberries with sorbet as a palate cleanser / first dessert, followed by a chocolate mousse served with Earl Grey ice cream and shards of different chocolates - probably the heaviest dish of evening, but a nice way to end the meal sated.  Corner House is a more Western-oriented restaurant in the heart of so much delicious southeast Asian cuisine, but even if you have limited time here, it is worth the stop to enjoy a cosmopolitan setting within the wilderness and a delicious meal to boot. To me, it feels like an appropriate representation of what Singapore has become, and it's worth making the trek out from the city center (about a 15-20 minute drive) to dine here."
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,3,28-Dec-17,Went for a lunch with some friends and the experience was lovely. Service staff was patient with our table of 6. Food was delicious and plenty to fill us up. Particularly love the concept of sharing appetizers so we could try a few different dishes.
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,3-Jun-16,"Possibly the best meal I've ever had, we did the 'Lunch Discovery Menu' for $128/person. The artistry that went into each dish was superb. Being a more 'average joe' when it comes to cuisine, I was timid about coming to a restaurant like this, expecting it to be outside my realm of appreciation. I was pleasantly surprised that even though each dish looked like it was created simply for appearance, it was backed up by some of the best tasting food I've ever had and each item being very different from the last. My favorite has to be the pork and even as not a big seafood eater, the seafood dishes were amazing.  To cap it off, the service is impeccable and the ambiance of the botanical gardens in an old black and white was sublime. With a bottle of wine, we broke the $500 mark between the two of us so not something for an average day out but a wonderful place for a special occasion."
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,12-Nov-17,Super nice environment in the middle of the magnificent Singapore Botanical Garden. Very excellent food. Courteous professional service. The day we were there even the "suitcase" chef owner was there and was very pleasant.
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,10-May-19,"Great food. Tasting menu , business, was perfect for lunch. The menu was a little different and not sure that I even knew what some of the items were but trust the chef!"
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,14-Jun-17,"Reminded me of Per Se in NYC for the oyster omelette, Narisawa & L'Effervescence in Tokyo for the nitrogen dessert & signature onion dish respectively, fused with a unique Singapore style. Great wine list. Highly recommend the Discovery Menu for an interesting gastronomical adventure..."
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,1,28-May-17,"If you want to pay a bomb for two sticks of asparagus and two blanched tomatoes, then do eat here.  I'm a non fussy vegetarian and celebrated a birthday here with friends. The veg menu was a gastronomic disaster. It just didn't have enough on the plate, and I'm a small eater. The starter was literally, 2 tomatoes and main 2 sticks of asparagus. How can anyone fill themselves up with this? Service was, at best, average. A bit condescending in attitude and coffee was cold when I had specifically asked for piping hot coffee.  Never again, and will tell my friends the same. Terrible experience."
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,4,14-Jan-17,"this was me and justin b's fancy dinner while on our trip to Singapore and it did not disappoint! first off, the location is awesome within the botanical gardens so its really pretty and tranquil but note that i do not recommend taking the LRT to get here because once you exit the station, its a long walk to the restaurant through the gardens and in the Singapore heat/humidity, its not that fun haha. after walking to work up an appetite for dinner haha...the restaurant itself is so cute! its just like a house with cool modern-ish decor. making reservations online was easy and no problem in getting availability about 2 weeks in advance. we were seated on the 2nd floor window table which overlooked the gardens for a nice atmosphere. service throughout the meal was outstanding too! as justin b. noticed, you know that you're in a nice restaurant when its the kind of place that folds your napkin for you when you get up to use the restroom haha. everyone was so attentive to our needs and each dish was explained to us in detail that we definitely felt taken care of! i mean after our meal we decided to taxi instead of walk back to the LRT so they called a cab for us and drove us in a golf cart down to the gate so that we didnt have to walk more!  as for the meal itself, we both opted to go all out and ordered the Discovery Menu and the wine pairings to go with it haha...every dish was a visual masterpiece! the presentation was so beautiful and some dishes like the vegetable garden which had some like 40+ ingredients in it was almost too pretty to eat haha. the taste of the food was actually really good too though haha...while every dish didnt wow me, they were all good and tasty - the pork jowl, beef, and cocoa pebble dessert were my faves though and they send you home with a tin of madeline cookies that were really good. the wine pairing turned out really well for us too - very generous pours and it was practically a diff wine with each dish so i felt that was worthwhile to do. just the overall price point about ~$300 USD per person and i wasnt overwhelmingly impressed with each dish holds me back from the full 5-star rating...but if you want a nice fancy dinner in singapore, i would still recommend Corner House!"

Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,28-Jan-15,"It was a little difficult to find the spot but once you are seated in the balcony area surrounded with all the green trees,you will know the walk is worth. And the food is surprisingly good. We had the lunch set. Must pay a little extra for the chocolate tart! It's rich and smooth and a little hidden crunchy inside!"
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,4,23-Mar-16,"I was a big fan of Au Jardin les Amis that used to occupy the same premises, so I really wanted to check out the new restauranteur. Came for lunch with 2 friends. We all ordered the four course lunch menu ($58++ per person), which came with a choice of 2 appetizers. Food proved excellent - good variety of flavors and combination of tastes - and met my expectations based on my experience with Au Jardin. The style is listed as ""modern European"" on this website, but the waiter pointed out local influences, so it was more like contemporary fusion. The pork jowl was exceptional. The only thing that might do with improvement was what seemed to me the overuse of mousse-type sauces and creams. As for service, a couple of the wait staff were excellent but a couple of others looked grumpy (one made eye contact with me several times and just stared with no hint of a smile). I also had to ask for my water glass to be refilled midway through the meal. No one asked if we'd like coffee/tea afterwards. Unfortunate that the service overall did not match the outstanding food."
Corner House,4.5,32,Modern European,5,15-Jul-15,"My foodie friend from Singapore recommended this restaurant for lunch since we were going to the Botanical Gardens (the restaurant overlooks the gardens!) . I checked the reviews, which were amazing. We were very pleased with the meal. Both of us had the tempura soft shelled crab which was beautifully cooked and presented. The cod was perfectly cooked (extremely fresh and moist). My braised beef cheek was so tender it was almost unnecessary to have a knife, and was delicious. Desserts were both excellent. One of the best lunches we have ever had. Portions are not large but adequate. Reviews are correct about the price. Three course for $S 42, but my wife upgraded the entree to Atlantic Cod for$8 and dessert to Kaya Toast for $9. I upgraded to braised beef cheeks for $12 and vacherin goma (black and white sesame ice cream) for $5. But still worth the price due to extremely good food and service. We met Chef Tan who came to see how we liked the meal. He took pictures with us and even showed us his kitchen since I said I am a foodie. Memorable experience overall !"
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,19-May-17,"The service at Sushi Bar was great with an extremely polite and conscientious staff. Decor of the location was very intimate but also great for larger groups.  Came here on my birthday and ordered tuna sashimi (comes with three large pieces of raw fish), crab stick roll, and the salmon aburi. All of the sushi tasted fresh and was of high quality for a fair price. They even put a little candle on the sushi, so I kinda had to give it 5 stars.  Would definitely recommend!"
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,5-Jul-19,"Oh! This was a great choice to come here. It's not easy to find as it is inside the mall and the numbering of stores is hard to figure out. But looking for it is worth it. I had the California Roll (very nice), the Salmon Aburi (wow) and the Spicy Tuna (another wow). Everything tasted so good and I enjoyed my time here a lot. The Cold Sake was also a good choice."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",2,6-Apr-17,"OMG Yelp let me down big time. I don't know how this place can be rated 4 1/2 stars. I'm pretty sure you can get much better sushi at Costco and better cuts of fish at any Isetan Japanese market. I was pretty excited to dine here since it was located at the Far East Plaza right next to the hotel so it was pretty effortless to get here after work.  The Sushi Bar is located on the 4th floor of this less-than-glam shopping plaza where merchants stand outside their shops preying on walker bys. It kinda reminds me of an indoor flea market with roll up doors where they sell lots of shimmering cheap stretch pants and battery operated clapping toys. I was convinced that the Sushi Bar was just a gem located inside this 1980's time-warped mall.  I sat down and ordered some green tea, the 5 Kind sashimi, and the Hamachi Kama which they warn you takes 30 min to prepare. My first disappointment was the tea bag. I expect it from a Mr.Sushi or a sushi food truck but this place was a 4 1/2 star establishment man! My dish of 15 pcs of sashimi quickly showed up. The first bite of the swordfish was like biting into a cold tough piece of Goodyear tire. There was no way my incisors could completely penetrate that nearly inch thick piece of white radial. I quickly moved to the other fish and none were impressive at all either. The octopus was not appealing either with the big suckers staring at me.  The grilled hamachi cheek was the only thing that somewhat saved this place from being a 1 star. It was good but still not great. Another thing I noticed was the lack of hygene in the handling of the soy sauce dishes. The guy stuck his thumb right on the top surface of where people pour their soy sauce. Some people may not care or pay attention to details like this but this germaphobe won't be returning here. They set ""The Sushi Bar"" way too low to be enjoyed by this foodie."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,4-Oct-16,"Ars you looking for value for money sushi in a restaurant that takes restaurants? Looking for a decently priced pint of beer to cool off? The sushi bar is your place, for all three of the above reasons.  Love that you can SMS them to make a reservation. Queues can get long so definitely make a reservation if you know you'll be headed there!  The chirashi bowl is my go to item on the menu. With a nice cold Asahi or Sapporo of course."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,28-Jul-15,"Fresh fish. Generous portions. Fast, professional service. A reasonable price. What more can you ask for?  My husband and I went here based on a yelp suggestion that popped up on my screen. And it was a block away from my hotel, so how could I say no?  It was a little bit challenging to find it because it is all the way in the back of the mall and the mall directory needs to be updated with its listing. But after we found it and waited in line, it was so worth it!  I had the normal churasi don plate which was a nice selection of fish, including salmon, smoked salmon, tuna, scallop, egg, salmon roe and another one I can't remember! All are top quality and generously sized pieces.  Husband had the smoked salmon roll, some salmon sushi, and two hand rolls. The hand rolls were like deconstructed cut rolls with a twist.  If you want to go exotic and get premium sashimi, you can do this here too. Check out the premium and seasonal donburi selections- very impressive for such a low key place :-)"
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,12-Jun-13,"I am never a big fan of aburi as I have yet to taste one which made me sit up and go ""wow!"" until now.  The aburi salmon sushi is fabulous. You can taste the smokiness of the seared salmon and it is not too overpowering. The sushi has a good balance of fish and rice. The presentation is good.  The premium chirashi is equally satisfying. Lots of fresh seafood and too little rice though the amount is just right to fill you up. The premium chirashi has seasonal items (uni, prawn and maybe others which are not included in the regular chirashi) and so is the price. Mine was $38.90 which I felt was reasonable given the 3 pieces of uni and sheer quantity of fish. I loved the aburi salmon and salmon belly in it.  It is crowded during lunch time, so you will need to wait to get a table. They lost our reservation though, so we took the counter seats until a table was free. For a small place, there are 6 people in the tiny kitchen slicing and dicing and cleaning. It is a decent, no frills sushi bar focusing on fresh and good food. I will go back again.  Oh, you can also request for fresh wasabi which is $4 extra. It is definitely better than the usual wasabi which is made from powder/paste."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,1-Jul-17,"Heard that this was the best sushi joint in Singapore, so we had to try. The restaurant was extremely hard to find, no one knew where it was and we were misdirected 3 times before we finally found it on the 4th floor.  Once we got in we were quickly seated, and the servers promptly gave us tea and took our orders. They were very friendly and helpful, giving us suggestions on what to order and portion control. We ordered a small sashimi sampler, 3 rolls from the chefs recommendation menu, and wagyu aburi sushi (best idea ever!!)  The sashimi was super thick and delicious, but I have to say my fav was the wagyu melt on your tongue aburi sushi and the scallop roll. Made the trip well worth.  If you have a couple if hours to kill and an urge to go on an adventure, give this place a try! Itll for sure satisfy your starving stomach after the treacherous journey to get here."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",3,18-Sep-16,Nice place for quality sushi. Business is good so it is advisable to make a reservation. One of the speciality is the soft shell crab with salmon roll. The salmon is torched so this dish is suitable for diners who are not into raw food. The ingredients go well together. The unagi avocado roll was a rip off in my opinion. I understand that unagi is not cheap but not a lot of it was given and 5 pieces of sushi at $17.90 before tax were not worth it. The other sushi rolls had more portions and value for money. Only cash or nets is accepted.
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,18-May-19,"I came here whilst on a business trip circa 2019. I happened upon this establishment one night. I ordered two rolls and a Coke No Sugar, formerly known as Coke Zero. The rolls were quite delicious. My bill was $40 for just myself, which is sort of a rip off. But Singapore is kind of a rip off itself. Since I put this meal on my expense report and was reimbursed in full, I didn't not ding them a star for the high price. Should I visit Singapore again and stay at the not-so-Grand Hyatt, I may return here for some sushi."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,15-May-16,"Yes I also get the raving reviews now. We decided to pop in on a Saturday night after the gym (protein :)) and were lucky to find only a few people queuing. So we got a table in no time and ordered scallop carpaccio, agedashi tofu, sashimi and a seasonal chirashi don.  The fish was amazing, the tofu bowl - the broth especially - was very tasty and the scallop carpaccio divine.  I found my favourite beer (Suntory premium) and the service was very friendly and fast.  The interior is modern, but more on the functional side. Anyhow, you do not come here for the furnishings, you come here for sushi. I wouldn't take a first date or celebrate my anniversary here, but I'll certainly be back for their delectable sushi and good service, at a price tag that doesn't involve cringing when you see the bill."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,5-Apr-19,"Sometimes, the hard to find, the out of the way, the small places are the very best. I am an aficionado of sushi/sashimi and I was very pleased with my order here at Sushi Bar. This is the first time I found Blue Fin Tuna in a Sushi Restaurant... yes, it is pricey but wow... what a difference ... excellent. I also ordered the Kodai Sushi and it was excellent."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,23-Sep-15,"I was taken here for dinner on a Monday night, and we got here before 7pm so there wasn't a queue. There is a promotion where you get 3 rolls for the price of 2, and my companion, by some oversight, ordered the prawn, soft shell crab, and salmon rolls, which all happened to be aburi-ed. I loved the rolls, but three aburi-ed rolls which sort of taste the same after a while, for 2 people, are a bit much, and hence we struggled to finish the rolls, which resulted in a fair bit of waste.  We also got the normal chirashi, a portion of salmon sashimi, a pitan tofu. The chirashi was topped with thickly sliced fish of various varieties, and the rice was sufficiently vinegared. Yum!  My favorite was the pitan tofu. Tofu is actually a misnomer as they use egg custard as the tofu, and then top it with century eggs, flying fish roe, spring onions, and shredded surimi. I really liked this.  Prices here are very reasonable for what they are. I guess this is the Singapore version of hole-in-the-wall sushi, tucked in a corner of Orchard Road. They should probably have a sake shot promo, just to value-add."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,2-Jul-15,"I didn't know about this place until a Yelper recommended it. The word ""Sushi"" was an immediately 'Yes' when she suggested having our dinner there, no regrets at all.  Hidden on the 4th floor of Far East Plaza, a mall that needs some upgrading to compete with its rivals. My first impression of the place is this must be a low cost type Japanese restaurant as its interior and menu matches to my impression but the cost of the food is at a different level! I ordered the Normal Chirashi Set (A bowl of rice with a mixture of assorted meat) that cost $24 to try out since I was told how good the food is.  When my meal was served, my eyes ""popped"" out when I saw the portion of the meat, it's probably the most generous portion I come across in Singapore so far. My first bite of it has made me craved for more. While engaging a conversation with my friend, I can't help but to enjoy every bite of it; multi-tasking at the same time. (Eating 70% and listening 30%) It was that enjoyable. I had the Chawamushi (Steamed egg) and that's pretty decent, so for the $30+ I paid for the meal, it's certainly worth the enjoyment.  Like they say, sometimes it's good to spend more for good food, this is one example."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,12-Oct-14,"Oh The Sushi Bar, you had me at hello... The sushi here is among the most mouthwatering and freshest you will find on the Red Dot! Furthermore, it won't break the bank either with the normal Chirashi coming in at c.SGD25.  I'm a rice and sashimi kind of guy hence my lifetime obsession with Chirashi (sashimi on a bed of rice). The Chirashi comes with an eclectic assortment of fish including: salmon, aburi salmon (my personal fav), tuna, yellowtail, swordfish, scallop, fish roe and tomago. The fish portions are thick, so you won't feel short changed after finishing the dish. My only complaint, if any, was the small layer of rice underneath the sashimi. I'm a huge sushi rice eater, so this could be a personal complaint. Fortunately, this was easily remedied by ordering an extra order of rice.  I'm a huge fan of the Sushi Bar, almost to the point of obsession. The lines are long, but It's worth the wait, trust me!"
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,24-Aug-14,"5 stars for above-average food at a price that's hard to beat!  The normal chiraishi comes with salmon, aburi salmon, tuna, swordfish, yellowtail and scallops. They're really generous with the ingredients- you get 3 thick slices of each. Quality-wise, I thought that it was on par with more expensive places like Sushi Tei or Itacho sushi.  Everyone orders the aburi salmon rolls- and with good reason. These were fantastic! The salmon was perfectly-seared and came in thick slices, and the mentaiko mayo on the top of the rolls complemented the rest of the ingredients well.  For both dishes, the fish:rice ratio was 2:1, which was impressive considering that it's usually the reverse in similarly-priced places.  Wasabi was better than the usual but lacked the clears-your-nose-immediately spiciness of the freshest kinds. I should know, because I put a teaspoon of it into my mouth and didn't die.*  I was here at 6pm on a weekday and it was EMPTY! None of the crazy queue that everyone's been talking about.  *I don't usually do things like these, it was part of a bet."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,9-Nov-14,"Hole in the wall shop that is a hidden gem in FEP!  Came here to celebrate my friend's birthday and the food far exceeded my expectations. There is a long line outside and all parties must be present to be seated, but it is quite worth the wait. They just opened a new outlet on level 3 of the same building but offers only 80% of the menu. We opted to wait for a table, and it only took 10min on a Sat night at 645pm.  The salmon and salmon belly sashimi are generously sliced and rather fresh. The famed salmon aburi roll did not disappoint, while the sirloin steak was tender, juicy, fragrant and perfectly grilled. It reminds me of the steak at New Ubin seafood which I absolutely love!  We also had the ""upgraded"" miso soup - some salmon fish/head soup which was very sweet :)  Enjoyed my dinner very much and definitely looking forward to coming back again!"
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",3,18-Dec-17,Ebi fry salmon Aburizal ($17.90++) - 3 stars Not very flavourful. Just decent. The sushi at Aburi Sushi Heishirou at Westgate was better and cheaper although it's kind of out of the way.  The place is also rather crowded so it's not great for a nice quiet dinner.
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,9-Jun-14,"Ok, I get it now. I understand why the queues here are out of control.  I've heard so much about this fabled, no frills sushi place in the most random location inside Far East Plaza. My husband and I are not the types to want to queue for food; we'd rather go to a place that's less crowded and costs more than to wait for cheap but satisfying bites*.  Luckily, we had some time to kill on a Saturday so we decided to give it a shot. I ordered the aburi salmon roll and ""normal"" chirashi, while Miguel got the premium chirashi**. On the menu, it mentions that the chirashis will be a 15-minute wait.  We get the aburi salmon roll first, and mm MM MMM it was delicious, melt in your mouth amazeballs! However, when the chirashis were delivered, they immediately stole the show. I felt like I was attending the funeral of all the fish from the SEA Aquarium. Look at how many (dead, beautifully cut up, fresh) fishes are in there!  I must admit that we came in ""medium hungry"", so we actually had trouble finishing our food. (No worries, we eventually did, as we knew it would be horrible to waste amazing fish like that.) But I'm pretty sure if I came in hangry, I'd be fully satisfied after a chirashi + aburi salmon roll.  I still wouldn't wait more than 30 minutes in the queue for this place, but I will no longer judge those who are willing to do so!  *Also, one of us is the impatient type. I won't say who. **For dem basic bitches, they also have a basic chirashi. Apparently, the fish will be cubed instead of sliced."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,22-May-15,"I'd like to give 4.5 stars. We had Daikon salad, fish miso soup, udon, seasonal chirashi and premium chirashi. We loved all of the dishes except Daikon salad. Chirashi was really good! For this quality I think it's reasonable. I just wish they would take credit card."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,27-Jun-19,"This place is hidden on the 5th floor. If you are in the mood for sushi this place is perfect. No wait yesterday at 5 pm. The Sushi is delicious, service impeccable."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,1-Nov-14,"Randomly found this hidden sushi bar while walking around Far East. Fish is really fresh, love the salmon roll and seafood rice.The store is now located on 4th floor instead of 3rd floor.  Will return (s!) soon for sure!"
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,27-Nov-15,"Patronise the far east plaza's outlet. get ready to queue but ingredients are fresh and packs a punch. It's rare to find quality and yummy food at a reasonable price at town but THIS IS IT LAH.  they have a new outlet, more upscale in ngee Ann city"
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,20-Aug-15,"I have been in search of a delicious, yet decently priced sushi spot since our move to Singapore. Thanks to Yelp, I think I have found it. I just pulled up my yelp app, typed ""sushi"" in the search bar and this spot popped up. As a bonus, it's only a couple of blocks away from our home. My husband and I decided to meet for lunch so we decided to try The Sushi Bar. We walked in a little after 12:00 and were seated immediately. The service was very prompt and attentive. We both ordered the miso soup. It is the best miso soup I have had since moving to Singapore. We decided to split some rolls. We ordered the spicy tuna maki, soft shell crab and due to the yelp tips, the salmon alburi roll. The spicy tuna maki is a very simple roll, but absolutely delicious. It was probably my favorite roll out of the three. The soft shell crab roll was wonderful as well. It was also presented beautifully. The salmon alburi was probably my least favorite of the three. I did not love the texture, but it was still tasty. We left the Sushi Bar feeling full and satisfied. The best part? We only paid $44 SGD for 2 soft drinks, 2 miso soups and 3 rolls. We will certainly be back! Thanks for the suggestion fellow yelpers!"
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,15-Jun-16,Take away for this place is nice and fresh seafood. A little pricey for what i have ordered fortunately overall taste was rather good. Ambience is what you would expect at sakei sushi. Watch the Q so come early with all parties intact. Think you are better off ordering the individual bowls as that would limit the pocket hole from getting too big. Again....fresh and thickly cut sashimi that saved the day.
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,22-Jan-16,"When the normal Chirashi bowl was served to me, I suffered a moment of amusement... I could totally relate to how the fish felt (packed, slightly glistening and a fishy aroma surrounding me).  No one comes here for the ambience that's for sure. The Chirashi does offer a nice selection of fish - a much nicer selection than some other places in fact. But for some reason, my go to Chirashi place still remains Mohamed Sultan Rd."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,22-Nov-13,"This is seriously one of my favourite places now! I love aburi and reasonable pricing, so yay!!! Haha. They only take cash though. Maybe NETS too, can't remember. Anyway, big tip - you can now do SMS/whatsapp reservations! Awesome. There is always a long line when I go, and then I'm very thankful for having made a reservation. Lesson learnt from the first time we tried to walk in..  This gem is hidden in an obscure part of Far East Plaza - I can never remember how to get there and end up wandering around the 3rd floor. But just follow your nose :p Or else, come up the escalators which are nearer to Goodwood Park (as opposed to the escalators nearer to Grand Hyatt) and I think it should be on that side..  Aburi salmon roll ($14.50)! Aburi scallop roll ($16.90)! Scallop mentaiyaki ($13.90!) All the flame grilled goodness you could ask for :) And mayo. Although thankfully there isn't an overabundance of it, I think Koh Grill and Sushi goes heavier on the mayo.  Chirashi ($24.90) is usually a gd deal too! Comes with a fair amount of fish and seafood. 3 Kind sashimi ($14.90) pretty gd deal too, fish slices are fairly large.  Oh, top up your own tea/water service. I mean, no extra tax and GST, you gotta serve yourself man :)"
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,11-May-15,"The Sushi Bar is tucked into a little corner of Orchard Road at Far East Plaza and if you don't already know about it, you might just walk past it wondering why is the queue so long. I came here for dinner, ordering the famous salmon aburi sushi, wagyu skewers, salmon kabuto miso pot and the scallop carpaccio. The ambience is definitely mediocre but the taste of the food is able to make up for it. The prices are pretty reasonable unless you move up the scale and go for premium stuff, that can set you back about $75-$100 per person. Otherwise you can get away with about $50 per person. They don't stinge on the portions and the food is worth the wait after you have ordered. The crowd here tends to be young, 20s to 30s and somehow you don't really see a matured crowd."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",2,4-Mar-17,(was first time visit to this restaurant @ Ngee Ann City) Food is ok and quite nice but owner's attitude and some staff's service is appalling.  Owner and the 1 companion sat in a larger table meant for 6 beside us on Friday evening.  The staff suggested 5 of us to squeeze in table meant for 4 or wait another 30mins while the owner heard the entire conversation and did not bother to offer to switch tables.  It demonstrate how the owner(s) value customers. Typical considerate human being would gladly switch place. But owner didn't and the staff also don't want to suggest switch cos he said its owner's reservation. So we requested additional seat but staff refused saying it will block but it clearly do not. Only when the 2 of you left and we request again then a seat is given.  I guess we were unlucky to be dining at the same time as the owners. The fact the owner saw how squeezed the customers were while himself has more than sufficient space and chose not to do anything to make experiences for customer nice is really appalling.
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",3,6-Nov-17,This place was way more expensive than any of the dishes deserved. We spent $80 CAD between 3 people and we were not full.
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,16-Oct-13,Been back 2 weeks and i have read much about this place. Attempted twice to eat there but failed. Today finally had the chance to try the most talked about Salmon aburi. It was delicous but it didnt wow me. I much prefer the yellowtail sashimi i ordered. Next time i would like to try the chirashi ^___^ service was fast and i'm glad i went there before 7pm. I sat pretty close to the other tables and i mostly heard praises from the others.
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,14-Jul-17,"Just go. Takes a bit of finding, but well worth it. Best sushi I've had in a long time. Sashimi was great, especially the tuna. Sushi was outstanding, we got some basic rolls and loved them all. This is not a fancy place, but a great place for great food."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,2-Feb-18,"OMG!!!!! This has to be the best find for sushi in all of Singapore. You would not think much by the mall in which it is located. But after a plate of the special nigiri, two amazing salmon and scallop rolls and a bottle of wonderful sake, you would think you had gone to heaven. Not to be missed if you are in Singapore and need a serious sushi fix."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,17-Nov-16,"Delicious sushi with a great price range; fresh fish, quick service, and a good price range. Nice atmosphere inside"
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,18-Jul-14,Worth the long queue! The crispiness of the soft shell crab really pumps up the flavors of the salmon aburi and moreover they fire-grilled the salmon making extra flavors on top but still raw and fresh on the bottom.
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,18-Jul-15,Queued for about 10 mins when I arrived there at 2pm.  Aburi salmon roll - creamy and melt in your mouth with a dollop of mentaiki sauce on top. Yummy  California maki roll - good but nothing special  Scallop mentaiki - this was the best dish for me. Scallops were thinly sliced. Mentaiko sauce contrasted nicely with its richness.  Salmon ikura rice bowl - my boyfriend had this and thought this very average. Probably wouldn't order again.  Tofu cheesecake - not as good as sun with moon's but decent. A little too soft and runny.  Total along with 1 beer was $81 for 2 pax
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,24-Oct-17,"Great food, quick service. Not the cheapest eatery in Singapore, but the sushi was fresh and high quality (per my husband), and the cooked salmon was not overcooked (always a concern) and flavorful!"
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,2-Sep-14,Fresh sashimi and rolls at very reasonable prices. The aburi salmon rolls lived up to the hype. Attentive service and new modern space on the 4th floor will make me return again. Ignore having to walk through the mall to get to this tiny gem :) Would like to return to try the spaghetti with roe and seared scallop carpaccio.
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,1-Aug-14,"The aburi rolls here are spectacular. The balance of ingredients and flavors and temperature is always just right. Even as takeout, their aburi rolls still taste awesome. If only they didn't close so early and the wait wasn't so crazy."

The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,21-May-13,"Yes, the salmon aburi roll lives up to the hype! It's delicious. I've not tried the soft shell crab version though, but I imagine that would be really good as well. I love the sirloin steak - always tender and tasty. The sashimi is fresh, and I like the thick cuts.  Prices are definitely reasonable for the quality of food. Just be prepared to queue if you do not have a reservation. This is definitely not fine dining, so be prepared to squeeze.  I'm impressed by the young chef behind the Sushi Bar and his team of young and enthusiastic staff. Can't be too harsh on them given that it's really a small restaurant and it's always packed. So I can understand when things like water/tea doesn't get filled up.  With good Japanese food at prices that won't burn a hole in your wallet, I'm not complaining."
The Sushi Bar,4.3,41,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,31-Dec-12,"Cosy,awesome food and friendly chef! what more can you ask from a sushi bar?? highly recommend the tuna yuke,soft shell crab aburi sushi roll and sirloin!! price are affordable and portion fits just nice for me!! make sure to make bookings during weekend as they get really busy"
Dian Xiao Er,5,3,Chinese,5,15-Dec-17,"The signature roast duck is quite exquisite. The meat is tender, the skin crispy, and the herbal sauce strikes a subtle blend of sweet, bitter, and savory to complement the duck. Think we got the Angelica herb sauce but could be wrong. Either way, just delicious.  We also ordered sauteed spinach with century and salted eggs as well as the hotplate beancurd. They're both lovely dishes but have no doubt the star of the show is the duck. Still on their own, they round out the meal nicely. We ate the above-mentioned meal on a weekday during lunch where they have a special for 2 persons for $30.80++  The weekday lunch deal is a good time to come try Dian Xiao Er. The space is quaint and the service is attentive but they mostly speak Chinese but the menu is straightforward enough."
Dian Xiao Er,5,3,Chinese,5,27-Jan-15,"If you are taking a train to Junction 8, Dian Xiao Er is located in B1, which is linked to the MRT line heading towards Marina Bay. It is in a small corner near the tonic shop and NTUC.  Dian Xiao Er has private rooms like this, which I had the tasting session in, it provides a lot of privacy. Additionally, they have rooms to accommodate up to 40pax, so be sure that Dian Xiao Er can accommodate your extended family.  1. Prosperity Salmon Yu Sheng The first dish of the food tasting was the yu sheng, along with oil and plum sauce, it was a very savoury dish. It can be purchased at an ala carte price of $42.80++. Lou Hei! The salmon in this dish was Norwegian smoked salmon, as such, it adds a salty touch to the sweetness of the plum sauce.  2. Shark's Fin Broth with Crab Meat & Conpoy The Shark's fin was very flavourful and yet not salty. Customers can also request this dish to be switched to a more environmentally friendly fish maw. You can definitely taste the shreds of crab meat in this broth, and even without vinegar, it was a very hearty dish.  3. Signature Herbal Roast Duck with 3 Flavours (Angelica Herb, Ten Wonders, Wild Ginseng) I had never seen a more shiny roast duck skin before, I could tell immediately that this was going to be the best roast duck I have ever eaten. The skin was so crispy, almost like a flaky croissant and the meat was succulent and juicy! Signature Herbal Roast Duck with 3 Flavours (Angelica Herb, Ten Wonders, Wild Ginseng)The duck was roasted with the herbs inside the duck and the herbs are then extracted and used to brew the herbal sauces. So if you order a ten wonders duck, it would be stuffed with ten wonders spices and then served with the ten wonders sauce. Typically, the sauce is poured over the duck, which might result with crispy duck skin becoming soggy. Joanne, the Dian Xiao Er representative also mentioned that you can request for the duck and sauce to be served separately.  The Angelica Herb was said to be the least ""strongest"" herb, so I tried it and indeed it wasn't as strong as the other two sauces. The ten wonders herb was the next sauce I tried next and I liked it the best. The wild ginseng sauce definitely was pure ginseng with wolfberries. I didn't quite like the ginseng sauce as it really washed out the taste of the duck. I would recommend first timers to try the ten wonders duck with the ten wonders sauce.  4. Sauteed Baby Lobsters with Pumpkin Sauce This was a new dish to my taste buds. I love lobsters and these baby lobsters definitely met my expectations of freshness. They came right off the shell with my chopsticks, so it's pretty easy to eat them. Do note, that this dish is cooked with curry leaves, coconut and chilli padi, so it can be a abit spicy. You can however request for the spiciness to be toned down to suit your taste. The sauce itself tasted strongly of salted egg, I couldn't actually taste the pumpkin in the sauce. It is a sweet and tangy sauce with a tinge of spiciness. But as I ate my second baby lobster, I started to realize that the spiciness increases exponentially. For this dish, Dian Xiao Er will serve the number of baby lobster of 2-3 pieces per pax.  5. Prosperous Braised Trotters The braised trotters were very soft and tender, pretty sure you don't need teeth for this dish. There are also fried oysters in this dish, which I found very generous of them. The broccoli wasn't hard as I had expected it to be, it was pretty soft. For most dishes with oyster sauces, I usually feel quite thirsty after eating it, but it wasn't the case with this dish.  6. HongKong Style Chinese Pomfret Probably the biggest pomfret I have ever seen, but even though I couldn't taste the fishiness at the begining, I realized that I could smell the fishiness of this fish at the end. Nonetheless for a group of 10, we managed to conquer one side of the fish and then, for second helpings, we flipped the fish over. This should give you an understanding of how big the fish is, since my photo does no justice to it. Joanne explained that this was a top grade pomfret that is steamed with shallots, ginger and spring onion.  7. Luxurious Abalone Treasure Pot When this dish was served up to our table, everyone pretty much was amazed, at the ""treasure"" in this dish! This dish is normally served in a claypot, but to show the extent of the treasure, for this food tasting session, Dian Xiao Er served it on a plate. The sea cucumber was slightly harder than expected, the fish maw was very soft and almost gelatinous in texture.  8. D-Boiled Hashima It was a subtly sweet cold dessert which was a very refreshing end to the hearty family style meal. The hashima was boiled with rock sugar and red dates."
Dian Xiao Er,5,3,Chinese,5,10-Apr-16,"Excellent roast duck. Crispy skin, juicy meat, not dry or tough at all!  Service is great even when the restaurant is crowded. Food is served fast and there is barely any wait.  The spinach with 3 eggs, as well as the seafood tofu are excellent choices as well."
Shi Hui Yuan Original Singapore Hor Fun,5,2,"Hawker Centre, Singaporean",5,13-Dec-22,"We came here around 6pm, and there were no lines. We ordered the belly-full tubby and SHI HUI YUAN special, and I enjoyed my soup a lot. Husband liked his rice version as well. Worth a try."
Shi Hui Yuan Original Singapore Hor Fun,5,2,"Hawker Centre, Singaporean",5,16-Nov-22,"Forget about Hainan Chicken Rice. Tubby Chix here is legit, and only for S$5.5. It comes with flavored rice, bite-size chicken, bok choy, mushrooms, and a raw egg."
Lang Nuong Viet Nam,3.4,7,"Vietnamese, Barbeque",5,11-Aug-20,"This shop is always busy I love beef pho and the sandwich. Beef Pho is very tasty and good portion  Their BBQ is very authentic , like how you eat in Vietnam ! They serve BBQ using charcoal fire !  The only downside is that you would be stuck with all the BBQ smell after dine in the shop  All in all, my favorite Vietnam stall in town"
Lang Nuong Viet Nam,3.4,7,"Vietnamese, Barbeque",1,7-May-24,"Disappointing menu selection. Also confusing menu as they had two menus displayed and one was an old one. Why do they continue to display an outdated menu? No beef tendon pho. No spring rolls. Food is both expensive and mediocre. Also over salted, and the beef was tough. Not sure why they are in business"
Lang Nuong Viet Nam,3.4,7,"Vietnamese, Barbeque",4,23-Sep-16,"Not sure how Long this place has been open but it's pretty solid.  It seems to mainly be a charcoal grill / steamboat type of restaurant but we elected for a la carte.  The former options involve small individual stoves on the Low tables where you cook the fresh meats and seafood you order off the menu.  For the latter, we went for staple test dishes like goi cuon, bun thit nuong and broken rice. Normally I choose pho to test the quality of any Vietnamese restaurant but I was drawn to the broken rice. Unlike most places here which just uses normal short grain rice, this place actually uses the small ""proper"" broken rice.  Sauces were a little different from what I'm used to but had good flavour and fundamentally had the sweet / piquant / savoury balance.  Pork chop accompanying the rice was good albeit a little skinny. I also wish they served the shredded pork rind and egg ''meatloaf"" as they do in Vietnam.  Overall I'd definitely try this place again. Next time I'll try the pho."
Lang Nuong Viet Nam,3.4,7,"Vietnamese, Barbeque",4,28-Jan-16,"Amongst the hip spots in the Jalan Besar area is the Vietnamese barbecue joint in an assuming shophouse. Open air and with tables through to the back of the shophouses this restaurant has a simple decor with folding chairs, a little on the low side, although not as low as in Vietnamese cities. Not knowing what to expect with Vietnamese barbecue, I found out that it's basically a simple cook it yourself concept. Not normally a fan of this, a meal for two was ordered with a Vietnamese iced coffee and some great Saigon 333 beer.  When the food arrived, so did the clay barbecue filled with glowing embers. Expecting to melt with the heat I was pleasantly surprised that this did not happen and the grilling could begin. The pork collar, shrimp and squid was excellent with the staff quick to step in and prevent you from overlooking. A 2nd tray with ladyfingers, corn, mushrooms, imitation crab and a hot dog were also part of the set meal. All were very good apart from the imitation crabmeat and the hot dog. These were ok-ish but the meal would have been just as good without them. The barbecue is small and cooking takes a while given the generous portions. The advantage of this is that you cannot eat too quickly.  The beer was cold and served over ice and the iced Vietnamese coffee was very good, but meant I never fell asleep until 3 am.  All in all this was a very good choice, a little different from most Vietnamese restaurants in Singapore although they do serve some of the more expected Vietnamese dishes.  Definitely worth returning to."
Lang Nuong Viet Nam,3.4,7,"Vietnamese, Barbeque",5,22-Jan-19,"Beef pho was amazing. The tables weren't comfortable, but I'm an out of shape American. Either/ or if you are looking for authentic Vietnamese I would recommend this place, not one of the one in the malls."
Lang Nuong Viet Nam,3.4,7,"Vietnamese, Barbeque",1,3-Jan-19,"They served us a plate of beef when we insisted that we didnt order and the person who took our order also insisted that shes not lying and she has a record of our order (in her phone). We only ate a slice of the beef and immediately notify them yet they refused to take the food back. I mean, who is going to justify whos right whos wrong? After that we asked for our banh minh and the same lady said that its coming. Next moment later, she asked if we still what it because she saw that we ordered alot of food so she didnt key in the banh minh order. Wow, contradicting much and she couldnt even come up with a better lie. Seriously though. When the BBQ chicken banh minh came, we saw the chicken was FRIED. That is extremely disappointed. They can't even get our bill right, it was completely wrong. I mean, all they have to do was to recall the table number. The amount we were charged was a shocking $100+ and we stood there 10 minutes writing on the printed recipet what was wrong. She admitted that it was because she keyed in other table's order into ours. So much for (i quote her) ""I did not lie and did not get the order wrong"" when we tried to explain to her that we did not order the beef. Finally, the bill came to $54. Lastly, we saw a baby cockroach walking around. Conclusion, come for the ""authentic"" Vietnamese experience."
Lang Nuong Viet Nam,3.4,7,"Vietnamese, Barbeque",4,31-Mar-16,"Not bad at all. Charcoal grill. Food is marinated w their own sauce. Cheap beer. V willing to change the grill when it gets black. Price is reasonable, 50+ for two will have seafood and lots of meat."

National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,17-Dec-23,"Such a great experience for Peranakan Afternoon Tea at Violet Oon. There's a few Violet Oon locations around Singapore and this one is inside the National Gallery. We had a bit of difficult time trying to find the restaurant as we went through the wrong set of doors but once in we were quickly greeted and seated down.  The whole afternoon tea experience was fantastic. I loved everything from the savory bites to the sweet treats. Normally I am not very impressed by the savory items in afternoon tea but this was really great and I loved the dry laksa that they serve. The sweet nites were also fantastic, showcasing traditional peranakan desserts and not too sweet which is the ultimate compliment!  This was such a nice afternoon treat and definitely large enough to fill in as a meal if you're going for a late lunch. The ambiance is elegant and classy without being too stuffy. It's definitely a wonderful location for afternoon tea with friends or a date!"
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,20-Nov-22,"Went to this place because I heard it was a well known restaurant that served Buah Keluak Ayam.  Buah Keluak Ayam (SGD$28) at first glance sounds like typical saucy dish - gravy, rice, and chicken. However, the key ingredient is the kelauk nut which is actually poisonous in its raw form. I would recommend getting this dish just to try the kelauk nut cured to be not poisonous (and quite delicious!). I did prefer the Beef Rendang ($28) a bit more overall, so I probably wouldn't order Buah Keluak Ayam on a subsequent visit.  To pair with these two dishes, my party got Chicken Rice Rice (rice from the Hainanese Chicken Rice) ($3) and Roti Prata ($2). Next time I would order two roti pratas and skip the rice - it was well presented and had great texture.  My party walked in and got the last two seats at the ""bar"" seating (more like counter seating in the corner of the restaurant that is near the bar). I'd highly recommend getting a reservation so you could sit at a table instead. The bar seating is quite cramped, and you're easily forgotten about because the counter is so out of the way.  After service charges and tax, the meal ended up being $71.80, about what I expected from a well known restaurant in a museum."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,18-May-23,"We called the day of and got a reservation for 1:30PM and we felt so lucky because this place came highly recommended.  Located in the National Gallery, it is a quaint and beautiful restaurant full of charm. The staff is friendly and most of the people dining were dressed up a bit, smart casual and cute dresses - clearly a place people like to take photos of themselves, the food and the ambiance.  We ordered the Singapore Island Iced Tea which tastes more like an iced coffee than a tea, but refreshing nonetheless. They also have a complete plant based menu which had delicious options for vegans!  The Kuay Pie Tee was delicious and interesting. We also had the King Oyster Mushroom dish and the Cod dish, both were perfect portions and very flavorful. For dessert we got the date pudding and the pulot dish, again beautiful, flavorful, and satisfying.  We are so glad we got to experience this delicious and beautiful restaurant"
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,22-Nov-23,"We absolutely love this location! The food is incredible no matter what you order. The ambiance is posh, vibrant, and classy all at the same time. It's definitely a wonderful location for a date night. The employees were great - everyone was so friendly and helpful. Highly recommend!"
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,12-May-23,"One of the best meals I had in Singapore, and just a fabulous combination of flavors to bring out the combination of cultures in Singapore (South Indian, Cantonese, Malay). Went as part of a larger group that reserved the whole restaurant so had a set menu, and I would take this menu any day it was incredible. The ambiance is a combination of a British colonial style but with bold rich color (green) to add a sense of lush richness appropriate for both a lunch or a dinner that transports you to a unique place in time and space. We had the distinct please of Violet Oon being there and speaking with us. Her wit, thoughtfulness and humor were fresh and a complete joy to hear. As a 7th or 8th generation Singaporean she has put much thought into each dish to reflect the cultures and spirit of the country."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,7-Feb-24,"We had 4 people during the lunch hr. Beautiful place inside the National Gallery. I had the Dry Laska which was good. Chicken wing made with/shrimp paste was tasty. Mixed vegetables w/Laska sauce, it was just ok. My friends had shrimp fried rice & the Cod w/Laska. Portions are small, tasty, service was good. They will tell you to leave once your 1.5hr is up. I'm glad I tried this place but I think San Francisco still has excellent food."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,29-Dec-23,Food and service was both very good - great setup tucked away inside the gallery. Got the Beef Rendang and it was really good. Would definitely recommend.

Nikko our bartender provided amazing hospitality we felt like queens!  Tip: sit by the bar overlooking the window!"
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,3-Nov-23,This was the best restaurant of our entire three week vacation. Service was exceptional and the food was delicious. The prawns were scrumptious. They give you a small treat to taste to see what your tolerance to hot chili is in the beginning so we did not make a mistake in ordering.
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,27-Dec-23,"Tucked away on the 2nd floor of the National Gallery, this restaurant serves both great and good dishes. I think the star of the menu are the satays, succulent chicken with absolutely gorgeous peanut sauce. The sweet & sour fish was also very good, as were many of the veggie options. Good service, funky decor and definitely worth a visit."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,30-Apr-23,"Outstanding. Really unique. Great selection, taste, service and atmosphere.  We had a fantastic meal and every server took time to explain the various options.  One of the best 5 in Singapore."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,3-Mar-23,"One of the best meals I have ever had. Everything was so delicious. I ordered the beef cheek, chicken satay, and chicken rice. The beef cheek was amazing - so tender and the sauce was delicious. The chicken satay with peanut sauce was so tasty that I ordered a second batch. I also shared some of my party's dishes as well and there wasn't one that I didn't like. The ambiance and service is also top notch. It's super small though so reservations are needed. I would recommend this as a must go for anyone visiting Singapore."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",3,28-Dec-19,"I think we had the ""miss"" here in the hit or miss situation. I was at a work holiday party a few weeks ago and learned my colleague next to me at dinner used to live in Singapore. He told me to eat here and order Buah Keluak Ayam as it would ""change my life."" I made reservations for dinner which we had last night.  When I mentioned to people we were going here, there was a lot of hype. Someone said the chef is a national treasure. The concierge at our hotel said she has not been able to get into the restaurant as a local and was surprised I was able to secure a reservation. The anticipation was really high. Our Chinatown tour guide also shared with us about the Peranakan people and culture to prepare us for Peranakan cuisine.  When we arrived, the host expected us, asking, ""Lisa?"" - first he seated us at a table in a high traffic area but we moved to a quiet side space. The restaurant is not very big so that might be why the reservations are hard to get.  It turns out my mom was sitting in the same seat Michelle Obama had been sitting in 12 days prior, as the host shared a photograph of her sitting at the table with him shaking Barack Obama's hand. We started with this fried tofu skin stuffed with crab, shrimp, chicken, and water chestnuts. It was kind of like an over-fried shrimp toast, my mom suggested.  For our dishes, my mom ordered butter prawns, I got the Buah Keluak Ayam, and Eric R. ordered the beef rendang. The server recommended nasi lemak (coconut rice) for Eric R. and my mom, and jasmine rice for my dish.  When the dishes came out, Eric R. was the lucky one. His had a lot of flavor and spice, and we all liked it. His beef was also very tender. My mom's dish was prawns in shell that were not cleaned, with very little flavor, topped with ""egg floss"" which was not mentioned when she asked questions about the dish. The server warned me that the dish I ordered - some people love it and some people do not - but I was adamant that I must see if it will ""change my life.""  The story of the Buah Keluak Ayam is chicken stewed in a sauce with the ""buah keluak,"" a swamp-based ""nut"" that is a poisonous fruit. Only the Peranakan people know how to cook it without killing people. It holds hydrogen cyanide, which has been used in chemical weapons. The Peranakan people scoop out the center of the fruit, ferment it underground in ash for 40 days, and put it back in then boil it to remove the poison.  A demitasse spoon was provided to scoop out this nut and mix it with my rice (which was adorned with fried shallots). Then, drizzle some sauce and supposedly, I would have some sort of food nirvana. Unfortunately, the Buah Keluak did not taste like the ""truffle of the swamp"" as I had hoped it would based on my colleague's enthusiasm for the dish.  We also were essentially ignored by staff through much of the experience, and with tiny water glasses, we were often without drink. Eric R.'s dish was very spicy so he asked a server to leave a pitcher of waster but the server refused. Eventually, we were served a complimentary warm tapioca cake with palm sugar syrup, coconut milk, and coconut ice cream to cool Eric R.'s mouth and perhaps make up for poor service. The best parts of the meal were the rendang and the dessert. We left a bit disappointed with the experience given all of the hype, but it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to try Peranakan food so now we can say we did."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,21-Feb-22,"Omigosh....this place was incredible!!! Peranakan cuisine at its finest...wow. Singaporean/Malay cuisine is something I don't typically crave. However, we saw this listed in the Lonely Planet guide for Singapore, and decided it would be worth trying it. Apparently Violet Oon is some culinary legend in Singapore. Her food is so amazing that I seriously think she needs to open restaurants worldwide. It isn't fair to keep this delicious food to Singapore only!!!  We had planned to eat here in person, but actually ended up doing take-away for this restaurant instead at our hotel room, since we were still waiting in quarantine for our covid test results. The Violet Oon website was messed up, requiring 2 hours ahead of time to place our order?! (That being said though, we had called the restaurant to place our oder, and they hadn't picked up. But I believe their service was really good, because they attempted to call us back 2 times after that!!) So we ended up ordering via Grab, which was so much easier. We ordered on Grab at 11:45am, and had our order DELIVERED at 12:20pm. That was super impressive, and better than that 2 hour time frame VO had given.  Food ordered: *Beef Rendang - DELICIOUS!!!! Definitely order!! In the past I've only had beef rendang that has been super dry, but this was one was extremely tender and flavorful. *Sambal Eggplant - Loved this one too, another favorite. Eggplant so silky, and great flavor from the sambal *Garam Assam Fish - great curry like sauce (spicy and sour), and loved the red snapper fish too. *Dry Laksa - this one was kind of disappointing, I will say skip this one. I didn't care for the flavor....didn't taste like laksa at all unfortunately. *Chicken Rice Rice - LOVED, great flavor. *Jasmine Rice - simple, but good if you want to balance out the rices *Roti Prata - great with beef rendang and the Garam Assam Fish. *Kueh Beng Kah (grated tapioca cake with melaka syrup and coconut milk) - flavors really great here, tasted sweet and chewy, but not over the top. I think this is their specialty dessert, and I'm glad I tried it.  Next time someone asks me for a Singaporean restaurant representing their cuisine that you can't get anywhere else, I would recommend this one first. Amazing!!!!"
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",1,21-Jan-24,"We were a party of 12 on December 8,2023 from the USA. The place was elegant and beautiful, The service was polite and warm. We were advised by the head waiter who is Filipino as to what to order. However what should have been the main star of the evening was a complete letdown. The food was just plain awful. , probably the worst cuisine we have ever tried. They all looked and tasted the same, medicinal, over wrought with so many overpowering spices, all with brown sauces. Except for the Hainanese chicken, the rest of the so called Pernakian dishes were hardly touched. Even the so called Singapore Sling was loaded with extra spices with bitters. I am not being facitious, but with the exception of the Hainanese chicken, my Diet coke was the only thing tolerable. The staff was apologetic. but you cannot correct bad food. We had been advised not to leave Singapore without trying the restaurant. We left so disappointed , hungry and disgusted. Never again."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,16-Sep-18,"There are two words that should describe this place: Dry Laksa. The preparation of this Singaporean staple is simply phenomenal, with a burst of many unbelievable flavors that have spice, tanginess and light sweetness of the coconut, all of which merge to create a dish with an unbelievable flavor profile. Admittedly, I will not call myself a Laksa expert as I was in Singapore quite briefly, but I do know a mouthwatering preparation of a dish when I try one. This is an absolute must.  The establishment as a very beautiful interior and is located in the National Gallery, thus there is a museum like feel to the entire establishment. It is grand and beautiful, but dishes are priced very fairly and not over the top as many restaurants in Singapore would be with this type of ambiance. Our waitress was pleasant and attentive, giving great recommendations from the menu to help newbies into Singapore food scene get oriented quickly.  I really enjoyed the Singapore sling here as well. The cocktail was made with great proportions and was a perfect refreshment for a warm summer evening. It's unique flavor and festive appearance can serve as a complementing detail to an otherwise very grand environment.  Aside from the Dry Laksa, tried a couple more dishes and was very impressed.  Tau Hu Goreng - fried bean curd with cucumber and bean sprouts, topped with peanut sauce. Interesting dish, despite its simplicity, but can't say it was to my flavor profile personally.  Kayu Pie Tee - fried rolls with bamboo, quite delicious and unique. A flavor unlike anything one would experience in the western world.  There is no wonder that this restaurant sits in the Michelin Guide for Singapore, it is a phenomenal combination of elegance, authenticity and reasonable pricing."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,1-Apr-18,"Violet Oon is a renowned chef in Singapore specializing in Peranakan cuisine which blends Chinese dishes with Southeast Asian spices and cooking techniques. The cuisine has a large base in Malay food, such as the rending, and coconut milk is a major ingredient in many entrees. Dishes from Northern Malaysia have more of a Thai influence, while those from Malacca and Singapore carry more of an Indonesian influence.  This cuisine is the finest of Asian fusion.  TURMERIC CHICKEN WINGS: A plant of the ginger family which is prominent in Indian and SE Asian cuisines, this deep orange color powder is an essential ingredient of curries. By itself, it has a very distinct aroma and flavor which is peppery and slightly bitter. Coated in a thin layer of turmeric batter with a hint of lemongrass and deep fried to perfection, these wings were some of the best that I've ever had.  BEEF RENDANG: This SE Asian rendition of a beef stew was packed with explosive flavors and was served in a rich and spicy hot creamy coconut sauce. The beef was melt-in-your-mouth tender. The sauce carried just the prefect level of heat for me - slightly burning hot but not overwhelming. I think the coconut milk had a soothing effect and made the heat more enjoyable. Spoon a healthy portion over steamed rice and enjoy this foodie's dream come true.  DRY LAKSA: Laksa is a rice noodle shaped almost like spaghetti and is often served with soup, just like Chinese noodle soups. The ""dry"" version, however, was soupless but was instead saut¨¦ed in a delicious house gravy. This dish also carried robust and explosive flavors that were stimulating to the palate. The deveined and deshelled prawns that came with it were tasty and fresh.  KUEH BENG KAH: If there is something known as a life-changing dessert, then this must be it! This tapioca cake looked innocently like an ordinary slice of cheesecake but was actually a slice of heaven in disguise. The cake had a good balance between softness and springiness, was browned on the top but moist inside. It was mildly but not overly sweet (perfect!) and had a refreshing and delightful taste. It was topped with Gula Melaka (palm sugar) syrup and served with a side of warm coconut milk."

National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,26-Aug-19,"The National Gallery is a treat to be walking around and even more so when you find yourself in a gastronomic beckoning called ""The National Kitchen"" - black panels with gold trims and a strangely harmonious cacophonyof floor tiles, the atmosphere is elegantly Singaporean. The black leather upholstered seats however is in a sad state of disrepair and really needs to be replaced. The back of my thighs were constantly reminded of how beat up they are.  Food - good. End of story. Solid mustard green duck soup just right amount of sour. Kueh pie tee is a generous helping - 9 altogether unlike Candlenut with its skimpy 4. And of course I showed up for the buah keluak noodles (could have sworn this was called buah keluak spaghetti at the bt Timah branch) and it didn't disappoint. Noodles was al dente and buah keluak sufficient. There was an undertone of coconut milk.  Solid service."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,18-May-19,"what a treat, had some time and a colleague took me here. The service is very stately, though friendly. the decor gorgeous and if you can spare the time take a look at the various displays (its not a lot but still enjoyable to peruse).  The food is flavorful, complex and delicious. The presentation is also very appealing. We ordered the sambal eggplant. if you like eggplant - get this! Also had the fried bean curd salad, definitely ensure you add the cucumber/papaya julienne on top of the bean curd with that rich, deep sauce and let the flavor explosion begin. we had several other dishes, all wonderful. Unfortunately as I was visiting, I don't recall all the names.  The server was also very helpful as he heard our initial order and mentioned it would be a lot of food and helped us pare down (vs focusing solely on getting the largest order)."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,12-Dec-16,"The restaurant was located at the second floor of the museum in the City Hall wing. The place was decorated in blacks. The place was fully booked for a Friday lunch time, but I managed to get a table through walk in. The place was packed for lunch.  Buah Keluak Ayam ($23++) Classic nyonya spicy and tangy chicken stew and buah keluak nut infused with fresh root spices of lengkuas and turmeric The nut was filled with rich creamy filling, which can be dig out easily by a teaspoon. The chicken was tender and easily tear apart.  Fish Head Curry ($42) Red snapper fish head stewed in an aromatic curry of cumin, fennel, chilies, turmeric and onions with tomatoes, baby eggplants and okra The curry was the indian version. It tasted quite spicy at first, but one ate more it became quite smooth and rich in taste. Although the serving looked small, the fish head packed lots of chunky meat in it.  Chap Chye ($15++) Classic nyonya festive dish of braised mixed vegetables and bean curd skin in a rich prawn bisque The sauce was savoury but it was lacking of the dried shrimps which was usually associated with the dish and the vegetables would be better if braised until soft. The vegetables was still crunchy.  We have the dishes with Chicken rice rice ($3++) and Nasi lemak rice ($2++), which was oily and flavourful on it own."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,8-Mar-19,"The decor of this place is on point. You can definitely find an instagram moment here. The server who greeted us was very friendly (and handsome). He seated us and then ended up being our server too. It is a pretty small place, but I imagine that he was spread a little thin. He maintained a helpful and friendly vibe throughout the whole meal. And we were there pretty late in the evening.  I ordered a drink called a haliatini, which was probably the best drink that I've had since I can remember. The price is pretty standard for Singapore, probably even a little less given that this is a nice restaurant.  We ordered the chicken wings and satay to start. Both were excellent. The wings came with this spicy, fishy, sauce. And the peanut sauce with the satay was on another level.  For main courses we got the Daging Chabek beef cheeks and the garam assam fish. Both had some much flavor, some spicy heat, and everything else. Very well balanced. And all of that was the perfect amount of food for two people who heavily eat.  For the price point, this place is worth it. The only negative criticism that I have to say is that the napkins are paper, which kind of makes it feel like it's not as nice as it is. But since this is in a museum, I'm guessing that it's because washing cloth napkins might not be a feasible option. A very small detail and, in the end, who cares? Especially because I recently got yelled at somewhere else (Gaggan) for being too messy on my cloth napkin."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,19-Jan-19,"When in Singapore, you must try Peranakan or Nyonya cuisine. What is it? Well, it's essentially the result of melting Chinese, Malay and Indonesian cuisine into one...which is pretty representative of Singapore. Violot Oon is one of Singapores original celebrity chefs - she's been doing this for over 50 years! I had the chance to enjoy a meal at National Kitchen during my stay in Singapore and it did not disappoint.  The place: Situated on the second floor of the National Art Gallery, National Kitchen by Violet Oon makes you feel as if you've entered a French salon (says Conde Nast Traveler). I mean, just look at the place! It actually reminded me of this little French restaurant in Toronto called La Societe.  The food: Mmmm...SO GOOD! For starters we had these little bundles of fried goodness called Ngoh Hiang $15. It's essentially deep fried prawns, crab, and chicken with water chestnut seasoned with five spice powder wrapped in bean curd skin.  Dry Laksa $22 - I usually have the soupy laksa so this was a interesting change for me.  Chap Chye $15 - it's a classic mixed veg dish, really good, but it wasn't anything special.  Sambal Petai with Prawns $18 - Okay...so this....was interesting. This is ""stinky beans"" fried in sambal (shrimp) sauce. Love sambal sauce, but man, I couldn't take the stinky beans. Please note that it wasn't the flavoring or how it was cooked, in fact, I loved the spices and the sauce. I just was not a fan of the after taste that the stinky beans left.  Tip: You must try their Kueh Beng Kah $10. SUPER yummy tapioca cake toped with Gula Melaka Syrup and coconut milk."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",3,27-Oct-18,"Violet Oon is a hometown proud celebrity chef and National Kitchen is her dedicated exhibit within the National Gallery to Peranakan Food. Everything here is slightly more upscale in its decor, and food preparation, so you'll find a $20 Hainanese Chicken Rice among other popular dishes priced upwards. The cocktails are good too.  I suppose in keeping with both its upscale nature and its Singaporean hospitality, my crummily dressed self was seated in a far back corner behind the bar unseen by the top echelon of Singapore's diners. It also meant that service was slightly subpar as being in the dark corner made getting waiter attention difficult.  Nonetheless I was in it for the food and it was fairly delicious. I started with a meaty duck soup. This was followed by a Malaysian spicy noodle dish that was actually made with Spaghetti pasta, and the ""starter"" was brought last, an oversized plate of turmeric chicken wings that had good flavour to them and again very sizable and meaty.  I would save this place for a special occasion, but having preceded a visit here with a visit to the Peranakan Museum it seemed a suitable way to end the day."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,24-Sep-18,"When in Singapore have Peranakan food.  We searched out National Kitchen by Violet Oong after learning about the Peranakan during our visit earlier to the National Museum of Singapore nearby (hint: take the guided tour).  We weren't sure whether we could get into the National Kitchen without paying for entry to the National Gallery. Turns out we could. The guard at the entrance was very helpful in showing us how to get to the restaurant (on the second floor) from the ground floor museum entrance.  The dishes were served famiy style which I love since I get a chance to try all the dishes.  We had a variety of dishes:  Sambal Kimchiam Udang - Lily buds with Prawns and starfruit.  Sambal Petai with Prawns - Stinky Green Bean Fried in Spicy Dried Prawn Sambal Sauce with Prawns.  Dry Med Siam - Rice Noodles with Mee Siam Chili with Prawns , Bean Curd and Chinese Chives  Garam Assam Fish  Kuay Pie Tee - famous must have. The brown colored sauce is sweet, the Sambal is spicy.  All delicious!  When in Singapore have Peranakan food!"
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,28-Jun-19,"Nice, old-school classy restaurant. Food is good, but I do not think it is worth the price to pay for the food. Ordered the coronation chicken appetizer, cod with laksa sauce, and the eggplant sambal.  The service was really good and attentive once I actually got to order. It was a little slow to start.  Overall, I think it's a good place to visit once to see what the hype is all about. If I was to return, I do not think I would immediately return here."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,6-May-19,Nice-ish Singaporean traditional food in the National Gallery  Food tastes pretty good though a bit sweet overall. Details by dishes below - Beef rendang - very tender - perhaps even slightly too tender for our liking - Satay - well-grilled - a good starter - Dried Laksa - an interesting take on the classic SG dish - the dried version does not short-change the laksa taste at all - still retains that fragrance and touch of spice  Beautiful ambiance - a good spot to bring out of town guests
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,8-Jul-19,"I stopped by this place to get some afternoon desserts with my family friend after walking around the National Gallery. We got 2 desserts and the chicken satay. Although there was a little too much chicken skin for me, the satay had really tender meat and seasoned pretty well. The kueh beng kah was a sticky cake with nice coconut and caramel flavors. The pilot hitam was my favorite! It is black glutinous rice with coconut milk and coconut ice cream. The rice stew isn't as thick as other places but I liked how I could the coconut flavors really came out especially with the ice cream. The hot rice with the cold ice cream gave the dessert a nice twist. The service was great: I remember a server brought us bowls to share our dessert before we even asked him to. The decor is really classy with mirrors all around and hints of gold, but also has elements of traditional South East Asian architecture like bamboos. Apparently the menus are different at each location so I would want to try out their other dishes next time!!"

Wait a minute.  All these are too much for sharing between 3 pax, especially when the Curry Fish Head is recommended for 5-6 pax. However, there were simply too many items that we wished to try on the menu. After a long deliberation, we finally settled on the Baked Cod Fish in Creamy Laksa Sauce ($34++) instead of the curry fish head.   The portion turned out to be small, roughly the size of a teenager's palm. Nonetheless, a main cod dish costs an average of $40 these days and this would be quite sufficient for one pax. The laksa gravy was creamy and not too spicy--perfect for those who have a low spice tolerance. In fact, it was one of the best tasting dishes from the newly opened National Kitchen by Violet Oon which offers a repertoire of Nyonya, Chinese, Malay and Indian cuisine.  While some said that there is finally a proper restaurant that serves the true national cuisine, I felt that it is still quite early to jump to this conclusion as not all dishes are made equal. The Hakka Abacus Beads ($16++) were too chewy and there were hardly any trace of taro even though the minced meat topping was flavorful and salty. I wonder if it is due to the heavy rich flavors of the other dishes we've had as the Nyonya Chap Chye ($15++) lacked the fermented oomph in the sauce.    Nonetheless, my eyes instantly lit up when I saw the Daging Chabek Beef Cheeks ($34++), a hunky slab of meltingly tender meat with bits of fats and chewy tendon drenched in appetizing red tamarind Gula Melaka and coconut gravy. Some might prefer this Indonesian Peranakan twice-cooked beef to be softer but the slightly sinewy texture was just right for me.  The first taste was sweet, followed by a subtle heat that triggered a mild sensation on the tongue. The gradual layerings of spices made this a far cry from the typical hot-headed, straightforward kind of Sambal Chilli. Wouldn't it be great if this comes with a complimentary bowl of rice instead of charging them?:)  One unique dish that is only available at this outlet and rarely available elsewhere in Singapore is the Opor Nangka Udang ($14++). I can't compare the Young Jackfruit since I haven't tasted it before. However, I had imagined it to be creamy and rich rather than diluted.  Stewed in salted fish and prawns in a coconut gravy, the chunks of young jackfruits were short of the typical pungency of a jackfruit, hence those who usually stay away from jackfruits may enjoy this dish. The sauce was mildly sweet but there wasn't anything attractive that would anchor my love and thus it is something I would not order again.  We rounded off the meal with two cakes, one of which is the hot-seller Pineapple Upside Down Cake. Served warm in a pool of chilled condensed milk sauce, it isn't anything spectacular, but still a charming diva in the world of butter cakes--soft, moist with finely textured crumbs. Just don't attempt to recall or flip through the menu for the price or you will feel the pinch when you realized it cost a hefty $12++.  The Kueh Beng Ka ($9++) aka grated tapioca cake was a faithful rendition of the traditional Nyonya sweet, made extra delicious with coconut milk and gula Melaka syrup. The cake was silky smooth like a baked custardy kueh, though it might be too smooth for those who prefer some rough gritty texture.   Considering the price range, this place is still more suited for special occasions or for foreign visitors who want to try local food in posh ambience. I was impressed by the eclectic mix of vintage and southeast Asian decor with old black-and-white photographs that draw similarities to Colony @ The Ritz-Carlton. It made me feel as if I was dining in a wealthy Peranakan mansion helmed by a matriarch.  However, the dining experience felt cramped and stiff as the tables were positioned too closely to one another. I think it might be best to come before 7pm even for weekdays. Otherwise, you not only have to wait longer for the food, but also have to raise your voices to speak as the place turns into a wet MARKET when it is full-house."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,13-May-19,Great ambience - classy and stylish without being overdone and perfect for some great Instagram shots.  I've been for both lunch and dinner and neither disappoint. At night the bar looks like it's straight from the Great Gatsby movie.  Food is amazing - you must try the chicken rice - and service is excellent. I make a visit every time I'm in Singapore.  They're also child friendly and if you go at lunch there are usually activities for children downstairs in the National Gallery.  You definitely want to make a reservation especially if you have a party of more than 2 people.
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,12-Apr-18,"i was on yelp doing something else when i realized there were reviews for places in singapore. had i but known, i would've been posting for places i've visites when there in one of a ha soul of trips over the years.  better late than never, i guess! i went to violet oon with my friend who lives in pasir ris. the ambiance and charm of old work singapore are definitely on display at this location within the national gallery complex. it felt very high class and there were plenty of locals as well as tourists enjoying food on a sunday when we were there last february.  all the dishes we ordered had exquisite presentation and tasted great. the pricing is probably consistent with other establishments of this caliber across the island. it's no hawker center, for sure! it's quality food by an established name in the singaporean culinary industry and that's what you're going to pay for but you most probably won't be disappointed.  if you're visiting singapore and don't know anyone local who can deconstruct the amazing mix of culinary and cultural histories, i'd definitely say go to a violet oon restaurant and put yourself in the hands of someone who's known far and wide for representing the food of the region.  just don't expect to walk in here after having visited the national gallery and get a seat! make a reservation in advance--you'll be happy you did!"
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,28-Aug-17,"Violet Oon has several restaurant locations throughout Singapore. This one is located in the City Hall section of the National Gallery. It's not every day that you get to experience dining in a beautiful historic building that houses a stellar art museum. It felt extravagant to go from viewing an amazing art exhibit, to then dining in a lavishly opulent historic setting. Reservations are a must. You can dine in the grand hall or on their scenic veranda. The menu is focused on Singaporean Asian influences. The service was fantastic. They were very accommodating for those of us in the group with dietary restrictions. The wine selection for a fancy spot was mediocre. Stick with the cocktails here. I was with a large group and everyone enjoyed their food, better than our expectations! I had the house specialty, the Beef Padang with coconut rice. I could have eaten the coconut rice by itself. It was PHENOMENAL!! The local chicken rice was bland in comparison. The beef padang paired with the coconut rice was one of my favorite dishes while in Singapore.  NOTE: If you are low on fitbit steps, just go to the bathroom a couple of times. It's a trek to the restrooms located in the museum. It's easy to get lost. Definitely ask the staff for directions. They will actually walk out a bit with you and point you in the general direction until you find the signs that then lead you to the museum bathrooms in that section of the building."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",2,27-Jul-17,"The National Gallery is one of my favorite buildings in Singapore - there is unwavering modernity in its regal architecture, natural light that streams in from just about everywhere, and never a touch off kilter in being something to everyone. There is so much promise in a restaurant lauded as a national treasure - the colonial style decor while unsurprising, is tasteful; and the menu looks like the perfect curation of reimagined Peranakan staples and local favorites.  We ordered Hainanese chicken rice for our 2 year old, Buah Keluak noodles, Ngoh Hiang, Chap Chye, and Itek Tim to share. Chicken rice was boring at best - bland chili (not spicy and a tad sweet - yuck), overdressed chicken, and flavorless rice. So uneventful that our kid, who loves chicken rice, spat out each mouthful and looked at the contents of her palm with curious disgust. The noodles and chap chye were so overwhelming in flavor - it was as if we were munching on spoonfuls of keluak essence and fermented bean paste. The slices of duck breast in the soup were rubbery; hinting at rookie soup prep. The ngoh hiang might have been the only saving grace - it was tasty and generous; if not for the heart burn I'm suffering from now.  I'd hoped for so much more. Instead of dishes that were heinously over-indexed on pleasing the tourist palate, and so off-colour in representing some of our nation's culinary gems. I am not opposed to an occasional indulgence in a quality tourist trap - I do love Chatterbox. And perhaps living in the vicinity of Katong where some of the best Peranakan food institutions operate has spoilt me rotten, but I know for sure that naming this joint National Kitchen is a real a misnomer. I have no idea why this place gets the stunning reviews.  The only reason it's getting 2 stars is the solid service and ambience. But definitely not enough to bring me back there."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,12-Mar-16,"Went for lunch here a couple of weeks ago. Our party of 2 arrived before noon to an almost-empty restaurant but we're told that all tables were booked and we had to sit at the bar. The place did fill up while we were eating but there were still a couple of empty tables by the time we left, so we could have taken that.  Anyway, it was our first time here and we were impressed by the food. Had kueh pie tyeh, beef rendang and dry laksa. The taste was good, and the beef rendang portion was big-- 3 small-palm sized pieces of tender beef. I had iced tea, way overpriced at $9. We finished it off with coffee.  The decor and ambience are really nice but I find the food quite overpriced. Will come back and bring visitors from overseas but I don't think I will go regularly."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,13-Jan-20,"Dining here was a real treat. I enjoyed the venue so much. Located inside a large contemporary museum. It's not often you get to walk thru a closed museum, so quiet, then into an intimate, bustling and oh so charming restaurant like this. It's a step back in time with history lining the walls in framed photos and culture embodied in the gorgeous chandeliers and artworks. A classy night out so dress up a bit to feel part of the ambiance. Service was some of the friendliest we've had anywhere. Host made excellent suggestions- we enjoyed every dish. Reservations normally a requisite though we got lucky arriving without because a party had finished early and they graciously accommodated us."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,29-Dec-17,"My knowledge of local food and specialities is very poor but my experience there was amazing.  I went there alone and without booking. They found me a nice seat with a beautiful view on marina bay sand hotel.. I ordered entry, main and dessert, a very tasty experience! The staff was absolutely perfect! Very kind and friendly."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,9-Dec-19,Ok so after getting in some history I was treated to this wonderfully appointed restaurant. I enjoyed the authentic food although some of the dishes were too spicy for me. If you have a high tolerance for spicy you may love it.
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,9-Feb-18,"I highly recommend the Violet Oon. It's not only cool because it's located inside the National Museum, but the food and atmosphere are fabulous. The Tau Hu Goreng is a good option for a starter. Both the Daging Chabek Beef Cheek and the Butter Prawn are delicious. I had the Kueh Beng Kah for desser and it's a most try!"
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,15-Apr-16,The Place so nice. You can't see from the street The food is great. All menu is best Noting to say only must try
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",3,2-May-17,Went for the high tea set not by choice. $56 for 2 pax with a tea or local coffee doesn't sound too bad until you realize that how cheap these kueh kuehs actually cost. Taste wise they are decent but for this price I wanted extraordinary. Additional $16 if you want dry laksa to make the meal more substantial.
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,10-Oct-19,"It's a very busy place, so I thought it must be good. Ordered baked lobster, not as good as it should be. When it came up, it was lukewarm and a bit tough to chew. Full of senior citizens, not sure why. Think I am the only tourist dumb enough to order lobsters, no one else there did. Salads are very fresh."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,24-Feb-19,"Absolutely delicious peranakan food. Lots of flavor, beautiful setting and decor, great service. Everything I tried was delicious. Highly recommended."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,14-May-19,"The food and drinks are quite expensive. Since the restuaurant is inside national gallery, the environment and decoration add points."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,31-Dec-18,"This was a very pleasant experience. The decor reminded me of a French bistro but was completely appropriate. The waiting staff were exceptional. We had a variety of dishes and shared, what we normally do in a Chinese restaurant and even had some poisonous fruit thing - fermented - which made it non toxic. Clearly as I am writing this the next day."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,21-Nov-16,"Second visit to National Kitchen, third overall to Violet Oon's restaurants. Still as good, possibly surpassed my memory of how delicious the food is!  This time I tried the gado gado for starters ($18) which was very substantial and filling for two. The peanut sauce was amazing. Even my dining partner who is a wuss with spicy food cannot stop herself scraping the sauce up with the remaining crackers! Tempeh was delish.  Beef rendang -- as fork tender as ever with a strong coconut-based rempah, very good, wish I had bread to mop it all up. Dry laksa remains a classic. We tried the buah keluak noodles this time and I found this dish the weakest -- Candlenut does it better.  I remember the desserts were all sub par in my previous dining experiences, so skip the pineapple upside down cake or gula Melaka something and order the kueh da da: Pandas crepe wrap of coconut.  Do make reservations days ahead even for weekday lunches!  And, the restaurant itself is absolutely gorgeous."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,17-Oct-18,Just delicious. Old world Singapore. I had the dry laksa noodles. Did not disappoint.
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,21-Sep-20,"the food was incredible! every bite was worth savoring:) the ambience was relaxed, great for a romantic dinner for two or chill night with friends! service was good but they run out of good wine selection, need better stock!"
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,23-Jun-16,"Peranakan House Reborn Stepping into National Kitchen is akin to stepping into another mini museum of its own. Or rather the realms of a Peranakan house.  Over 200 peranakan tiles cover some of the wall of the 3000 sq ft restaurant located in the heart of National Gallery, while other corners spot old photos. The titles came form old houses that have been torn down, but still very much worthy as part of historic restorations. Ms Violet Oon 66, has been a strong advocate of 'The Singapore Taste' through her cooking and writings and has set up National Kitchen to advocate just that.  There is another outlet going by the name of Violet Oon Singapore located in Bukit Timah Road and we were there to celebrate the birthday for my bestie!   The Interior The design of the restaurant came about with the help of a Design Innovation Assistance grant from the Design Singapore Council. With the grant they brought the best designs in this restaurant, driven by local design house Black. To create a homey feeling, spot the little touches around. You will be able to see spice pots near the entrance. From documentary, the restaurant's bar and takeaway boxes is green in tone, to reflect Ms Oon's Chinese name- Swee Gek meaning Jade.

National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,2-Nov-16,"I loved The National Kitchen as soon as I walked through the doors. Greeted by an old world charm and an attentive friendly host, we were whisked away to our reserved table (rez req'd) in the middle of a room framed by black and white tiles, gold sconce's and emerald adorned walls. The wait staff was attentive and quick and the manager gave a friendly hello. Singapore's most signature cuisine is showcased in tasty renditions of flavorful dishes."
National Kitchen By Violet Oon,4.4,58,"Asian Fusion, Singaporean",2,11-Jun-18,"Service leaves much to be desired for a restaurant that claims to meet fine dining standards: my waiter's English was quite poor, portion sizes were not accurately described, they didn't refill water unless I specifically asked, waiter would arrive with dishes and stand there until I moved stuff around to accommodate rather than do that himself, etc. Nothing horrifying if this were a cheap roadside joint, but this place pretends to be more than that... The satay was greasy, my rice was undercooked (some grains uncooked!!) and the beef cheek dish flavours were completely unbalanced. Overall a disappointing experience given my expectations and the chef's reputation. Had I known I would have eaten elsewhere as it is clearly not worth the money in a city with so many options. Feels like a tourist trap."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,24-Mar-18,"One of the best ramen... really authentic Japanese ramen. Love the spicy version with cheeks. The cheeks are really tender and melt in your mouth.  The only reason on why I don't give 5 stars is due to the side dishes, I thought they are only average. Try both chicken karagee and fried pork dumpling... both are average.  Keep with the ramen, it's the good one."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,17-May-18,"Great location and great food! For someone who isn't well versed in Raman or even like soup, there are other options to choose from here that can satisfy the ol' appetite.  My co-worker and I shared the yaki gyoza which were excellent! I also had their fried chicken which I'd go back just to have that again, and I had a salad which was a good side but honestly, can't remember much about it anymore.  My co-worker had one of the ramen bowls which he thought was pretty good, but I don't think it's the best he's ever had.  Location is great as it is right on the quay. The restaurant is fairly small so it's more intimate and I didn't feel like my food was mass produced. Service was kind of interesting as I wasn't sure if they choose not to attend tables unless required, but they were polite and helpful when we did flag someone down. You pay at the desk, not at the table which no one explained to us so we sat for quite some time at the table!  I'd totally come here again!"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,14-Oct-19,"A bit difficult to find. 2nd floor, far corner looking at the hotel and river. Mapquest has a different name, not helpful. Ramen Santouka is what you have to plug in AND you have to know 2nd floor. Had better ramen in Tokyo, dah, but good and inexpensive for table service in Singapore. 3 beers, Gyoza, salad and soft boiled egg ramen was only $61 Singapore dollars. (44.50 US) The salad was super fresh, beers were great (2 Tiger and 1 Asahi) ramen good, pork was a bit too fatty for me. Good and friendly service!"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,25-Nov-18,This place is amazing!!! The staff is extremely courteous and helpful. Each person that came to our table was so nice. The food was beyond delicious! I had the original ramen with pork and gyoza. Each little gyoza was perfect and tasted like it was made with Jesus tears! I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a happy belly & a fantastic experience!
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,9-Feb-18,"Nice place, second floor above the street facing Clark quay, ordered the special ramen which was great flavor, rich with very nice tender pork. And the bun (less recommended). And the fried pork gioza- which were really tasty."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,2,4-Apr-16,"Honestly, I've had much better ramen the the Bay Area but it's the first ramen I've had in Singapore. I was craving ramen so gave this a shot. It took me awhile to find.  I left decently full but found the shoyu ramen to be too salty. Also, the salty and fatty pork cheek added to the saltiness.  The atmosphere was nice because you can look out onto the river.  The only issue was the waiter consistently kept trying to upsell add-ons to the ramen and dishes to multiple tables around. It was annoying the upsell table by table and then the customers would just say no question after question. They should know when to stop asking in my opinion or just not be so aggressive with the upsell. Which is why I decreased my review from a 3 to 2 stars.  Not the best ramen and for the price I could try another place rather than returning. I'll have to update this review when I try other ramen in Singapore.  Tip: seems like they're a part of certain promotions with credit cards, etc. It may be worth checking out of the deals and if it's available for Santuoka."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,21-Oct-15,"Located in the purple zone and also a corner of Central is Ramen Santouka. This was their first outlet in Singapore. Their second outlet resides in Cuppage Plaza in Orchard Road.  Santouka's founder Hitoshi Hatanaka opened his own ramen shop at Hokkaido in 1988 because he was unsatisfied with all other ramen establishments. Its thin-noodle ramen with elegant broth topped perfectly with mouthwatering slices of char-siu pork and pickled plums gained popularity in Hokkaido immediately. Now in 2015, there's outlets of Ramen Santouka all across the globe and my friends even mentioned the outlet in LA, tasted better than the outlet in Singapore! Looking through the menu you realize that you get to pick your soup base. Be it, Shoyu (soy sauce flavour), Miso (soybean) , Shio (Salt flavour), or Kara-Miso (spicy soybean at $1 more).  The dining area of Ramen Santouka is a rather elongated one, that stretches into the kitchen. The chef is able to see every customer who walks in and walks out. And for every customer that walks out, the chef will say thank you for patronizing them. It is very typical of Japanese ramen shops in Japan to be small and compact, so that the chefs are also able to witness the customer's experience with their ramen.  Miso Ramen (Medium ) $13.50+ I went with my lone favourite Miso. I admit, the bowl looked small, but it was deep. After my first few dips with my chopstick, I realized I was looking at the chance of skipping Beard Papa for desserts later! The broth itself was thick and you could see a thin layer of oil swimming on the top. It wasn't too gerlat, as much I managed to drink quite a bit of the soup.  The noodles are the winner here. They are extremely springy. Similar to that of maggie noodles and yet without the waxy exterior that instant noodles give you. The texture of the noodles were consistent throughout the entire serving. The bambo shoots here were also crunchy and since they absorbed all the flavour from the soup, they sure were tasty!  The two glorious slices of char siew weren't fatty at all. Instead they were tender pieces of juicy meat, that again, absorbed all the goodness from the soup.  I enjoyed my bowl of ramen as it didn't have me craving for water like the ramen from other competitors which are ladden with MSG leave me."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,8-Sep-17,"The ramen was superb: I upgraded from pork belly to pork cheeks--amazingly fall-apart tender and quite lean. And I had the spicy miso base, which wasn't that spicy--just enough to make it interesting. The noodles were thick but still al dente--good mouth feel. The chicken Karage was delicious, and the gyoza were almost perfect.  My only complaint? In the course of an hour, we heard an endless loop of Kenny G. Despite how good the ramen is, it doesn't make up for the audible torture I had to endure. My tip: definitely try this, but bring your earphones!"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,15-Apr-15,Hands down my fave ramen in Town. So good it was one of my bucket list of final places to eat during my last week living here.  Seriously the pork cheeks are melt in your mouth amazing and the broth is equally as tasty. Even the service is well above average for Singapore standards. You won't leave disappointed!
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,1-Feb-15,"Yum!  While visiting Singapore I had been looking for a place with decent food along the Quay's. Found this via Yelp and while it is up inside the Clarke Mall there is still a view of the river and action below.  I think I arrived rather late for dinner on a weeknight, but there was no wait (i was alone) and was seated immediately.  I ordered one of the set menu's with prawns, ramen and salad etc and it was A LOT of food! Probably enough for two. It was so much that i couldn't finish and they asked me upon checkout if everything was OK. I thought that was nice they were concerned, but it was DELICIOUS I just couldn't eat it all!  Atmosphere is pretty standard, but service and food was above average. I would recommend for lunch or dinner!"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,22-Jan-15,"I'm only home for 1.5 weeks and I have a long list of things I want to eat. Singapore is known for being a culinary haven. If you are a foodie, come to Singapore. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. With so many options and only 1 stomach, I had to make very smart and wise decisions. Every food choice is strategic. It has to be the best if not why bother.  There are tons of ramen places in San Francisco Bay Area. However, I always tell my friends nothing beats the options and quality available in Singapore. Outside Japan, I think Singapore is probably the only country with the most ramen shops per square mile. There is fierce competition. I researched and read reviews, strategically planning which ramen shop to go to. Santouka was my final pick!  Oh boy!! I was blown away. The egg was perfectly cooked. Nicely set egg white and gooey, soft egg yolk. The shio broth was flavorful and not overly greasy. You can pretty much drink up all the broth and not feel coagulated fat swimming in your stomach. The noodle texture was great and it did soak up some of the flavor from the broth. The pork jowl ... OMG ... and OMG one more time!! one bite and I felt my life is now compete! Well seasoned and cooked perfectly. It tasted better than the pork jowl I had at Lazy Bear recently.  I've been to Japan numerous times, ate many bowls of ramen. I must say I'm in love with Santouka ramen."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,18-Mar-19,"Everything we had was super good and we wished we could eat more even after being full! The pork cheeks were unbelievable and everyone should have them at least once in their life. We also had the Miso soup, delicious, the salmon salad, and sushi"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,21-Jan-16,"Good ramen and soup at good value. Nice views too.  I really like the Kara miso ramen. Better then my expectation. Naturally I finished the bowl or noodles and the soup. Never one to waste. My friend had the normal miso soup base, apparently it taste just as good. The gyoza is surprisingly moist inside and the skin is very thin. I think they got the balance right.  The service is prompt and attentive. Too bad they only allow downsizing of the noodles but no upsizing. I love good noodles so its a bit disappointing.  The afternoon sunny view of the river is a bonus. I bet it looks better at night with all the Clarke Quay neon!"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,11-Jan-14,Yelp brought me here. I was staying in the area so it was a short walk for me to come here for lunch on a rainy day. I'm not a huge fan of ramen but wanted to see what the rave was about. It was great... broth and noodles where perfect and I ate everything. I'm giving it a 4 star because of the price point... I think it was on the expensive side and ramen isn't expensive. Also it took me awhile to find the location as it's hidden. If you're in the central or clarke quay and looking for ramen come back here. I'm a fan!
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,5-Jul-14,"For a delicious, fulfilling ramen quick-fix, come here.  I always get the pork cheek and shio ramen, but my friend who had the miso was quite disappointed as the miso base doesn't taste much of miso. In my opinion, the only flavors that should be on the menu are spicy miso and shio.  One word: SHIOK!"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,17-May-17,"Great food, good service, reasonable prices.  A little tricky to find in the upstairs location, but once you're there it's very good. It's also not very touristy for being right in clarke quay. I've been a few times for lunch and dinner and it's always very tasty. I always get the standard ramen base and it's always so salty and flavorful. Will continue to go back."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,22-Dec-13,"Pork cheek ramen. Nothing beats the pork cheek ramen. Sure, it is a tad pricey, but definitely worth it. The pork cheeks are so soft, they melt in your mouth. I also like how the noodles are chewy. I also recommend getting the spicy soup if you want a kick for the broth.  For the rest who prefer a combination of rice and noodles, definitely order their set meals which serve up a generous half portion of ramen and a half portion of rice.  Highly recommended!"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,1-Dec-15,"my favourite ramen in the many ramen chains here.  Love shoyu. While other broth pales in comparison, or stinks of pork bones that I seriously considered conversion of my religion, santouka has a delicious soup base.  Strangely enough, I could do without the pork cheeks. I am just contented with the soup.  It's nice and rainy now. coming to this page is agony to my tummy :("
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,24-Jan-16,YESSS.  The good news: I can finally cross Santouka off my "Man I wanna try that one day" list.  The bad: It's now on a cravings list. And $14++ isn't exactly what you want to spend on lunch everyday.  The deal: Lunch sets are excellent. Spicy fans - go for the Kara-miso broth. Its depth of flavor really sets this place apart from other places.  The sitch: I suspect I reaaalllyyy enjoyed this lunch because the place was empty (super late lunch) and the servers were still so super friendly and attentive throughout. I imagine the eating experience would be very different at peak hours when you are basically sitting on top of the person next to you.  TL;DR - Eat lunch here at a non-peak time for ramen you won't regret.
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,17-Jan-17,"One of the best ramen in Singapore! Tucked away and hard to find but worth the hunt. Had the Kara-Miso vegetable ramen and it was delicious. Lightly spicy, not too salty or oily, just the way I like it. Give this place a try if you haven't already."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,1-Oct-12,"One of the best ramen in Sg.  I love that their grilled pork cheeks which is served on the side and not soaked in your bowl of ramen. It is beautifully seasoned and comes with a great bite. I like this much more than the typical char siew slices that comes with most ramen...sometimes, they just taste too fatty for me.  It is hidden in a corner in Central though. Just look for the nasi padang restaurant Rendezvous and it is right through it."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,2-Aug-12,"The first thing that greeted me at the entrance was the long queue at dinnertime on a weekday. Fortunately, the wait wasn't too long and I managed to get a seat with my friend after about 15 minutes of waiting. The service was friendly enough and I ordered my favorite bowl of Shio ramen. As usual, I was presented with a great bowl of ramen with really thick and savoury soup. However, there's one thing that I would like to say: the quality of the ramen isn't that consistent; sometimes the noodles would taste somewhat ""alkaline"", and other times the soup was not as savoury as usual. But suffice to say that when your luck is good, you'll be eating one of the best bowls of ramen in Singapore. Another plus about this restaurant is the great views of Singapore River, so do request for a seat near the windows if possible!"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,5-Aug-12,"Located in a hidden corner at Central, Clarke Quay, Ramen Santouka is a hidden gem that die-hard ramen aficianados wish that reviewers would stop writing about.  Space is a scarcity so expect long queues should you visit at peak timings. Service is brisk, efficient and straight to the point. And having had the chance to dine at Ramen Santouka in Harajuku when I was on a holiday, I can attest that the service levels and taste are all exactly the same.  One must-have dish is their speciality 'toroniku' or pork cheeks ramen. The pork cheeks come on a separate plate with condiments from the ramen (available in 3 different soup bases - shio, shoyu, miso) so you have the choice of pouring everything in or dipping them in one by one. (i recommend dipping - it just tastes better!)  Having tried most of the other ramen joints that have sprouted up recently, I can safely say that no one else comes as close as Ramen Santoukawhen it comes to taste, service and quality of the food served!"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,3,26-Aug-12,Have come here a few times but i think the ramen is still just average nothing much to rave about it. I find it a little oily at times and the soup more to the salty side which doesn't taste natural. I do like the pork that they serve though as it is tender than the ones i usually eat.  The egg was cooked really well not too runny or hard boiled but it hardly had flavour to it so still a miss for me. The price i found was ok for the amount of noodles and meat that they had added to the dish.  Service was a little on the down side maybe the staff were not trained properly? I would rather go to other ramen stalls to fix my ramen cravings.
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,17-Aug-12,"This restaurant is located in central, among all the japanese restaurant , this stall serves awesome pork meat that you would want to revisit again! As they have advertised , the meat from the cheek is the best and truly it is. The meat is very tender and it just melts in your mouth. The texture is amazing. But keep in mind of your salt intake, the meat is slightly salty and together with the soup, you will end up full after drinking loads of water. Hence it is a better choice to choose the miso soup based instead. Waiting time during the dinner hours are manageable. It takes about 15 minutes to get seated , service level is good. Price might be on the high side but definitely worth the money, given the amount of meat and the great quality."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,26-Aug-12,"I'm gonna say it. THIS IS THE BEST RAMEN IN SINGAPORE. No contest at all.  Everything from the set-up to the furnishing to the food to the look of the chefs to the service is perfect. And I've been there multiple times, in peak periods yes and no, and they were all great gastronomic experiences.  Look at the picture of the pork cheek I've taken. I call it angel's wings for a reason. The texture's so soft and feathery, it melts in your mouth, instantly warming you up from the inside and taking you to the heavens. The taste of the meat is distinct, the moment you eat it, it's there in you for life. The soup's thick and heartwarming, the flavours are well-mixed and the noodles have a springy consistency that keeps you going after many spoonfuls.  The eggs are another level of genius. You HAVE TO buy the extra eggs to try.  There's free plain water that comes in a JUG for you (woots!) and if you can, get the seats that overlook the Singapore River. In this way you can check out the great night view outside and also turn to your left to revel in the open kitchen - the mastery of the chefs.  If I've got one complaint, it's that too many know about this place and I wish the queues weren't so long every time.  Check out eatlikeawhale.blogspot.sg for more pictures and reviews."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,11-Feb-16,Good soup base and quality tender pork belly and cheek. Noodle has good texture too. Even better if they can put more spring onion and green.
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,8-Apr-13,"Santouka in Singapore. ;) As a frequent go-er in Los Angeles, I'm content that there's one right in The Central, Clarke Quay. I don't know if it's due to different origin of meats in the two locations, but the pork here wasn't as 'tender' as the ones served in LA.  I always either get Miso or Shoyu and they don't dissappoint. Can't wait to try Ippudo- Singapore version soon!"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,5-Feb-13,mMMmmmMm. yummilicious. my personal favourite ramen. i first had santouka when i was in e US - it was love at first slurp. i was thrilled when they opened a branch here. *jumps*  pork cheek is simply divine - its tender and tasty. i visited santouka many times and i always find e soup tad salty but the pork cheek evens out e flaw in e soup. that has always been my impression till my last visit last week. e soup is no longer salty. it was just right :) i had e kara miso which i wished was more spicy. it doesnt taste spicy at all.  and i also like how they have a whole jug of water at e table to help yourself with.  awesome ramen + unlimited water + perfect view overlooking clarke quayside.. what more can you ask for ?
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,31-Mar-18,"The broth was delicious. It is one of the best I have had in Singapore. I got the spicy miso with the pan fried dumpling set and savored every bite. I have to agree that the chasiu was not as tender as I would have liked, but that broth! The dumplings were some of the most flavorful I have had. The staff were very friendly as well and helpful when narrowing down choices. I can't wait to go back!"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,25-Aug-15,"Here in Singapore for work and absolutely loved it. Glad we found this place, spent forever looking around for it. Nice place for a beer and a frosty mug too."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,21-May-13,"My boyfriend and I were craving a good ramen so he decided to bring me here!  Although we reached slightly past 9pm, there was still a line :( in any case, last order is at 9.45pm so we still made it!  I don't remember the exact name of what we ordered, but if I'm not wrong he had a Char Siu Ramen (large) and I had a Shoyu ramen (medium) Please go to my blog (on my profile) to see photos!!)  The ramen is a perfect balance between soft and chewy, and the soup was really authentic tasting. I was quite impressed because the soup is very flavorful! The only downside is probably that the char siew / pork was extremely tough. We expected a more tender meat but... I was left un-glamorously gnawing at my meat.  Anyway, my boyfriend has a huge appetite and we were both quite hungry, but the Large ramen was too much for him, and the Medium was wayyy too much for me :( We couldn't finish the noodles!! I would say the large is good for sharing?  We also had a BBQ pork bun each ($3), and it was really really yummy. It kinda looks like the Chinese kung ba pao! It's also served with a mini-sized cup of tea, which tastes like a normal Chinese tea. Please go to my blog to see photos!! I don't quite know how to describe it.  Overall it was a good experience :) the ramen is really good but I wouldn't say it's the best in Singapore!! If you're bored you can check out my blog (on my profile) to find out my favorite ramen place ;)  If we're in the area we'll definitely come back when we have a ramen craving :) it's delicious and quite worth the price! Our check came up to about $40 for 2."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,13-Feb-13,"Thank you Yelp for guiding me here and for helping me decide on what to order. I really love love the Pork Cheek, it's so tender and tasty in a melt-in-your-mouth kind of way.  Tried shio and shoyu broth and I prefer the shio because its cleaner tasting and is less salty vis-a-vis the shoyu. The portions they give for the noodles are huge! I was starving and yet couldn't finish.  Only reason why this place didn't get a 5-star from me was cos its slightly on the pricey side and there was a long queue (so if you're starving think twice about eating here)"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,11-Sep-12,"You can always count on a great bowl of ramen at Santouka, no matter which outlet you go to.  I wouldn't call it the best (I am partial to the darker, richer kinds like at Keisuke Tonkotsu King and Nantsuttei, but that's just preference, but it's pretty darn good.  The queues are not too bad. Perhaps because it's impossible to find it -- or anything at all -- at the maze known as The Central."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,7-Aug-12,"I may prefer Nantsuttei and Tonkotsu King for the type of ramen i like, but Santouka is a very pleasant alternative. The pork broth is excellent and so is the chashu and pretty much everything else on the menu."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,3,8-Aug-12,"When I first came to Singapore, I was skeptical about the idea of queuing for food, particularly for mediocre food. Fortunately, this place is one of the few that I would have no hesitation in queuing for. The dozen or so times I have visited on a weekday evening there is a long queue, thankfully the table turnover is high, so the wait is never more than 15 minutes.  I am a ramen lover, and for a decent bowl outside of Japan, this place is my normal go-to when those cravings become unbearable. Being a Shio Ramen fan, I'll be honest in having no idea what the other items are like. Though saying that, the pork cheek!! Wow!! Such a deep rich complexity combined with a soft tender texture. If you dine here you must must must try it! Service is almost invisible during busy times, though a great tasting bowl of ramen and pork cheek makes up for those short fallings. Jump in the queue and you won't be disappointed."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,22-Nov-12,"This place is AWESOME! OMG, the pork cheek is AMAZING! Your loss if you don't order it because it's perfectly done and oh so moist. It has a slight bit of fat on the side, but who cares! The fat's not even oily at all, and spitting/cutting out the fat would just be a waste of all that lusciousness  And as for the rest of the bowl, no complaints. The broth is perfect (a regular size is not enough), the noodles perfect. You just have to spend a bit more for toppings. But for such bliss, it's all worth it!"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,22-Oct-12,1. Ramen (hot soybean paste) & fried rice set - the ramen broth was so good (not too spicy. just right) - the noodle was crunchy too :) - fried rice was only meh... had better. - I would recommend getting the Tokusen Toroniku ramen set (you can choose your ramen... choose Hot soybean paste! it's the best). Best part of the set is that it comes with a side of pork cheeks (super good. specially imported from the US. it literally melts in your mouth)  2. Chicken gyoza - LOVE! although I've tried the pork one and think it's better. - nicely pan-fried. comes out with a think slightly crispy skin. super succulent and juicy inside (careful when you bite it! it's hot).
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,27-May-14,"So happy I got to eat here whole in Singapore! The ramen was delicious and the pork cheeks, omg the pork cheeks were amazing! I loved it so much that I have to order a side of them! I don't think I've ever had pork just melt In my mouth like this.  I was very happy with my ramen and left very very full!  One thing I don't recommend ordering is ice tea. I unless you are looking for some hot tea with a glass of ice, then I suggest you skip that and simply go for a beer :)  Totally recommend going there because you won't regret it!"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,16-Nov-12,"Probably my favorite ramen in Singapore. I love the simplicity of the broth (I prefer shio) and the pork cheek is just heavenly. I usually order chicken karaage as well and dip it into the ramen.  The only downside to this joint is the noodles. It could just be personal preference though. I prefer it thin but Santouka's are a little bit on the thicker side.  PS: They have another location in Somerset, somewhere near Centrepoint. Same quality."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,2-Sep-12,"Our favorite ramen place in Singapore has got to be Santouka. S declared this the best ramen in Singapore even before we tried several other popular ones like Marutama and Ippudo. The verdict still stands though. The Santouka brand, which was started in 1988 in Asahikawa, produces the best Hokkaido ramen on our little island. Despite the secluded and hidden corner in Central Clarke Quay, the queue gets pretty crazy during meal times due to the small capacity (it's about a 25seater) and insane popularity. I think it has only gotten better with the opening of a second outlet at Cuppage Terrace.  If it's your first time to Santouka, i highly recommend the Tokusen Toroniku Ramen (S$19.50 for shio/shoyu/miso, S$20.50 for Spicy Miso). For that price, you would get a dish of roasted pork cheek and a bowl of springy and curly yellow noodles. Sides sold separately.  The jowl meat is the most precious and delicious part of the piggy. It's only about 200-300g per pig (duh, they only have 2 cheeks!) Very richly flavored and tender! This texture has been likened to fatty tuna. I would say the meat is more firm (this is pork not fish you know).  Best ramen still. Ippudo doesn't come close."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,12-Apr-19,"This is a fantastic little place. The soup broth alone was delicious and the added extras were a great compliment; Pork cheeks egg mushroom and green onion. The Bao bun was Devine. I had read this place was hard to find and it was, tucked away in a back corner of Level 2 The Central, number 76, but it was worth the hassle of locating it. The staff were so lovely taking time to explain dishes, making sure I was comfortable, attentive, and whilst the service was quick I didn't feel hurried"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,25-Aug-12,"This ramen shop is one of my favorite ever since it opened at The Central. It is a small shop with a fairly good view.  Typically, most people like the soupy ramen but i prefer dipping ramen. The noodles are thicker compared to the ones for the ramen. It comes with a thick broth that tends to be too salty to drink but you can dilute its saltiness with tea and drink it as a soup. Oh yes. Don't forget to pair the ramen with a plate of their pork cheek slices.  For dipping ramen, there are very few places that serve that in singapore so whenever i am in mood for dipping ramen, Ramen Santouka is the place I will go."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,8-Sep-12,"Santouka is consistently touted as one of the best ramen places in Singapore and its popularity was clearly evidenced by the queue that was forming when I went there for dinner. Despite the crowd, service was good as the staff were efficient without being brusque. This really is a get in, eat, get out sort of dinner though so if you're looking for a more relaxed pace, you're better off elsewhere. It really is all about the ramen at Santouka.  While Santouka really does serve up a good bowl of ramen, I do think there are better ramen places out there. I've learnt, though, that ramen preferences can be very subjective. So while I found the ramen a bit too chewy on the chewy-springy spectrum, some of my other friends loved it. And while I thought the broth (the Shio broth) was super tasty, some of my other friends thought it was a bit too rich and salty.  But we all did agree that the egg was tasty, though the yolk a bit too gelatinous. And the pork cheek was fantastic and and just the right proportion of fat. The portion is quite large though. So if you're ordering the pork cheek ramen, I would recommend ordering the smaller portion if you don't have a huge appetite."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,28-Aug-12,"Searching for Ramen Santouka is almost like a treasure hunt in The Central - attempt to reach it from another location in the mall other than the escalator near it, and you'd almost always lose your way.  Though, upon finding it, the journey almost seems inconsequential as you peel back the curtains to reveal the treasure within. Springy, handmade noodles served in a thick, flavourful broth topped with tantalizing slices of cha shu (roasted pork) await the curious adventurer, and delving into the tantalizing layers of each mouthful reward the palate like no other.  Few ramen places can compare when it comes to the combination of both affordability and taste."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,21-Apr-15,Amazing ramen! The queue wasn't too long and the waiting time is short. Perfect dine in place for ramen lovers!
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,19-Aug-13,"Overall I was really impressed with this place. Based on others reviews I ordered the ramen (shoyu) with pork cheek and a side of the soft boiled egg tamago thing. The service was super quick - but should be since all the ingredients are already cooked. The ramen broth was very substantial, more like a soup than a broth. Taste was excellent, and I'm sure a lot of that great flavor comes from the oils floating in the broth. This is one of those dishes that if you don't finish it (you should finish it though, it's really good) and put it in the refrigerator it'd probably have a healthy layer of fat congealed on the top the next day. Also known as Good Flavor. The pork cheeks, contrary to everyone's comments, does not actually melt in your mouth. There is a little chewing required, albeit not as much as, say, a pork chop of the same size. The cheeks are really flavorful. Fat, pork and salt, how can you go wrong? Everyone loves bacon. Either you love it or you don't know you love it. But you do love it... This is bacon for kings. I would eat the cheeks off these pigs any day. The egg was also good (for a hard boiled egg). I liked the creamy center. The marinade used to flavor the egg is very subtle and not overpowering. I love them, I should have ordered another. This place is kind of difficult to find - at least it was for me. But if you are stubborn (like me) and have ramen on the brain (like me) you'll get there. I had to walk through a different restaurant just to get there. And then on my way out I felt sorry for all the fools eating at that other restaurant. They should've gotten ramen."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,7-Nov-13,The best place to get Japanese Ramen in Singapore.
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,15-Jan-14,"Broth is complex and flavorful, and the noodles are done well. The pork cheek is fatty and marbly, a good addition to a small sized bowl of ramen. I wanted seconds!"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,15-Aug-13,"Ramen Santouka has different soup bases for the ramen, like shio/shoyu/miso/spicy miso, and they come in three sizes! i love that. i chose the smallest size shoyu ramen ($12.50), and it was just the right size for me! (: loved the robust broth and springy noodles, and i was so full after that! and i loved the tamago!!! it was so delicious *drools*. it's really the very well-executed japanese egg which is slightly more than half-boiled inside (maybe 3/4? haha) so that the yolk is still gooey even though the outside is hard boiled.  what i would really recommend though, is the pork cheek ramen! it was SO GOOD. after eating my one pathetic slice of cha shu in my ramen, i tried one slice of my friend's pork cheek. and it was so melt-in-your mouth tender! absolutely delightful! this is THE perfect dish with the broth-noodles-pork cheek-egg coming together in a harmonious blend of delicious flavours and you will not regret having this ;)"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,24-Jan-13,"The tokusen toroniku ramen is something special - the pork is very soft. The miso broth is decent. The noodles are top quality. The only criticism is for the price I'd like to see more toppings along with the pork, the bowl seemed a bit empty. Otherwise, a great fill."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,3-Feb-13,"It was good. The pork cheeks had a lot of fat but were pretty tender. The normal pork was a little hard but good. The spicy ramen tasted nice and flavorful with enough spice for a kick but it wasn't overwhelming. The large size is actually quite large for Singapore, and the small size is quite small."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,1-Dec-15,"Their ramen is considered the best I can find in Singapore. I particularly like Miso and Shio, giving different taste and yet very fulfilling. Special pork cheek is a must try!"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,10-Jul-13,"Opps what if I say this place is even better than Ippudo? Well in Singapore at least, I am not a fan of Ippudo in Singapore. If you are like me, give Santouka a go! The pork cheek is ohsodivine, and the broth... I swear I went to heaven right there. My only complain: The portions could be bigger, sorry hungry... what to do :P"
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,4-Nov-15,My favorite ramen shop. Really delicious soup and also nice char siew. Haven't been disappointed. Will keep going.
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,25-Feb-13,Trying out the amount limited ramen and the pork cheeks. Really really juicy
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,23-Mar-15,"Best ramen I've ever had outside of Japan. This is a famous brand with many worldwide branches, but the Santuka in Singapore is better than any others I've had in the US in the past. It's very pricey if you go for the top end pork, however, and it does feel kind of strange to pay 30$ for what's supposed to be a homey low class dish. There's usually huge lines here if you go at the wrong times, but turnaround is usually pretty fast."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,3,19-Mar-15,"Decided to try this place after seeing so many positive reviews on Yelp. My honest opinion, ramen here is average only. There are other better places. Here, the soup ain't the best. Not salty but also not really tasty. Pricey too compared to other places."
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,4,1-Oct-12,Excellent stuff. One of my go to places for a ramen fix.
Hokkaido Ramen Santouka,4.3,59,Ramen,5,12-Jan-13,"Still the best ramen in town!! Order the black pig ramen (which meats are separated from the ramen) and you won't be disappointed! If you order the other ramens, they're comparable to the other ramen joints in town"
Gu Cheng ¹Å³Ç,4,1,Malaysian,4,3-Aug-17,"The restaurant was located under a rather old HDB block, within walking distance from the MRT stations. There was outdoor alfresco dining, as well as, indoor air con dining.  Penang Laksa éÄ³ÇÑÇ²Îß·É³ (S$7.80) Flavourful, tangy and spicy Malaysian fish based rice noodle soup. The spicy and sour broth taste so good with a hint of lemon grass and mint leaves. The assam laksa was rich in flavour, and was served with a scoop of Hae Ko Ïº¸á (sweeten dark prawn paste) for the extra kick.  Penang Hokkien Mee éÄ³ÇÏºÃæ (S$8.80) Steaming bowl of noodles with rich shrimp broth, studded with sliced pork, shrimp, vegetables and chillies Although some of the dishes were listed spicy on the menu, the spiciness was actually mild. This dish was one of the examples which was commonly served more spicy.  Crispy Tofu ´à¶¹¸¯ (S$5.80/ 4 pieces) Tender pork and seafood filling. Crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It was firm inside and packed with lots of liaos such crunchy water chestnut and juicy minced meat.  Gu Cheng's Signature Carrot Cake ¹Å³Ç²ËÍ·¼@ (S$8.80) Stir-fried radish cake with prawns and eggs. Chinese sausage and preserved radish that is cooked with our special sauce. Due to HDB's rules, there was limitations in cooking in the kitchen, but they still managed to produce a plate of nicely crispy carrot cake minus the wok hei.  Penang Lor Bak éÄ³ÇÂ±Èâ (S$3.80/ roll) Marinated fried pork filling wrapped in bean curd skin with a pinch of Chinese five-spice powder. The lok bak, looked similar to the local version's ngoh hiang (five spice roll), was packed with chunky five spice powder marinated pork, and rolled up with soy bean skin ¸¯Æ¤. It was served with a mixture of cincalok and onion achar.  Penang Otak éÄ³ÇÎÑö (S$3.80/ piece) Steamed fish and prawn custard with spices, wrap in banana leaves. It packed with chunky meat.  Penang Cuttlefish Kang Kong éÄ³ÇöÏÓãÞ³²Ë (S$6.80) Cuttlefish and Kang Kong tossed in sweet & sour tangy sauce, topped with ground peanut for a crunchy texture. Crunchy crispy you tiao but the sauce was a tab watered down.  Beef Stew ìÀÅ£Èâ (S$8.80) Stewed for 12 hours in Guinness Stout with potatoes and carrots in a full flavoured brown sauce. It looked quite watery but the meat and vegetables were quite tender and soft.  Prawn Paste Chicken Ïº½´¼¦ (S$5.80/ 4 pieces) Chicken mid joints marinated in a putrefied prawn paste. Plump and bursting with juices on the inside encased in a shatteringly thin and crispy crust. The meat was juicy without too salty.  Salted Egg Chicken ÏÌµ°¼¦ (S$7.80) Tender chicken fried to golden perfection and coated with velvety cream of golden salted egg. Wiped clean the rich eggy sauce with the tender boneless nugget-like pieces.  Finished off the meal with Ang Ku Kueh (peanut), Kusui, Talam Pandan, Kueh Lapis, Pulut Seri Muka ($1.50/ piece).  Don't forget to accompany the meal with its in house made drinks such as Gu Cheng's Signature Rose Tea ($3), Sour Plum ($2), and Calamansi ($2).  Currently the restaurant having a 1-for-1 promotion for its lunch set which included 1 Main course, 1 Side dish, 1 Drink, 1 Dessert, when one made a reservation through HungryGoWhere's website or mobile app, from 18 July 2017 to 31 August 2017."
Momiji Japanese Buffet Restaurant,4,1,"Japanese, Buffets",4,1-Feb-15,"Truly value-for-money Japanese buffet. For slightly under $50, it's eat all you can including free-flow beer. Spread is quite good given the price you pay. Not the best of quality but good enough for me. Highly recommended for Japanese buffet fans!"
Goldhill Hakka Restaurant,4.8,5,"Hakka, Seafood",5,14-Jun-22,"The proprietor has switched to commercial fish paste--no longer the squishier housemade parang (wolf herring) fish paste of old. But the modern take is snappier, less fishy but also less sweet. The yam nuts have the legacy texture. The highlight of the meal for me were the steamed flower Lala (clams).  A very strong example of Yong Tau Foo and other steamed items"
Goldhill Hakka Restaurant,4.8,5,"Hakka, Seafood",5,2-Jul-17,"Yong Tau Fu cravings? Try Stephen's Hakka Yong Tau Fu located in Katong. I have been eating Yong Tau Fu created by this family for almost 40 years. Stephen apprenticed with his father, and now his daughter is apprenticing with Stephen. Getting Yong Tau Fu here is a family tradition and on our Favorite Foods in Singapore List.  What makes this place so very special? Let's begin with the most amazing red sauce and chili sauce. The red sauce is my favorite since childhood since I couldn't eat spices when I was younger. Now, they are both delicious to me. It is rare that I rave about a condiment, but these sauces are pretty special.  Next, the fish paste is fine, firm and flavorful. It pairs well with the delicious variety of bases: bitter gourd, eggplant, medium firm tofu, fried tofu, red and green chillies. They also have little fish balls. They also have my favorite white is a fish paste roll wrapped in tofu skin. Yong Tau Fu is usually fried, then cooked longer in a robust broth. Sometimes, I enjoy eating the wrapped fish paste just after it is fried. I remember hanging around the wok when I was young and eating these as a snack or appetizer.  After it simmers in broth, the Yong Tau Fu is pretty good, too. I love the flavor of the slightly wilted cilantro cooked by the steam from the broth. I love mixing the red sauce in the broth for a delicious red soup. Hmmm. I wish I could get me some right now.  If you are lucky, they have fish roe. Wow! Roe is amazing with the red sauce. Okay, if you get my drift, I love the red sauce so much that I can almost eat it with anything.  Other specialties at Goldhill Restaurant are the steamed Pomfret, and the small stir fried clams. These 2 dishes do not carry-out well. However, the Yong Tau Fu develops beautifully when you take it home to enjoy in your own home. A toast to Stephen and his family who brought be back down through memory lane from the first bite to the last sip of broth mingled with that red sauce."
Goldhill Hakka Restaurant,4.8,5,"Hakka, Seafood",4,11-Jul-12,"This quaint old place along Changi Road is a real throwback to the olden days and for the younger crowd, feels a bit like you've travelled up to Malaysia for a meal. It was pretty crowded when we were there for lunch on a weekday, so we sat outside along the five-foot way, and sipped our Water Chestnut drink cooled with ice from a little bucket, kopitiam style.  The main draw here is the awesome Hakka Yong Tau Foo, but the place is also famous for its seafood - the Yu Sheng (raw fish) was great - and this is coming from someone who doesn't like sashimi - and the La La (shellfish) was quite good as well. The quintessentially Hakka dish of Abacus Beads, Yam and Tapioca topped with dried shrimp was very respectable.  If you've never had the chance to try Hakka cuisine, this is a great way to get a taste of the culture, but be warned that parking along Changi Road is not the easiest, especially on weekends!"
Goldhill Hakka Restaurant,4.8,5,"Hakka, Seafood",5,18-Oct-15,"Not my first time here but definitely my first time reviewing this place. It's so quaint, authentic and the food is great. I've always been here on the weekends only and each time the food quality is consistently good. A very nice experience if you've never had traditional Hakka food. There is a very limited menu but I've tried everything on it and it's all amazing food. Highly recommend trying at least once!"
Goldhill Hakka Restaurant,4.8,5,"Hakka, Seafood",5,8-Apr-17,"If you are health conscious and want good & fresh YTF, I highly recommend this eatery. The decor is nothing to shout at, but the YTF are all hand-Made.... Very fresh. No carbs are served here ......just very fresh YTF, steamed fish.  To me, this YTF is SG's best"
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,16-Oct-23,Love the ambiance and the food was really great! The staff are very friendly too they helped me choose pho that perfectly suits my taste.
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,1,6-Feb-21,Open 6 years / not authentic PH? / no lemon and not enough sauce / too much MSG / not comfortable sitting / dirty toilet / not amicable service / our first and shall be our last //so dusty shelves !!!!!!
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,20-Sep-18,"This review is mainly for the crab noodles because it's my favorite thing on the menu! The pho is good but not as good as these crab noodles. Yum.  The line here on weekends can get quite insane, but I arrived at 6pm and held on to my table for dear life. Service is efficient but they were quite confused with our orders as we constantly placed new orders instead of placing one at one go. I guess they're more used to people who show up to eat and leave, and not us grazing types.  The fresh roll is not my favorite but I quite liked the meatballs. They're nice and juicy and come with a delicious dipping sauce. But enough distractions, let me talk about the crab noodles. Unlike pho, they come with mee tai mak which is a kind of short rice noodle and is super slippery and look like little tails. As a result, you have to scoop them up with a spoon, inhaling all that delicious broth along the way. The soup is like a super jazzed up version of pho broth, with all the added umami delightfulness of crab and seafood. The bowl is generously topped with crab & pork meatballs as well as some shrimp. I literally inhaled the entire bowl in one go and had barely anything left for my companions who wanted to try it. Oops.  I would go back again just for my favorite crab noodles. I've also tried the bun and pho which are good but ... pale in comparison to those crabby, savory, delicious noodles."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,4,16-Nov-20,"Small Vietnamese eatery by Beach Road. Been searching for a good pho place in town for ages and happy to say this place did not disappoint :)  Food: Ordered the Sliced Beef and Brisket Pho and a side of Crab Spring Rolls. The broth was flavorful while the rice vermicelli was smooth and bouncy. Took away a star because both the beef slices and brisket were a bit dry and tough. Spring rolls were fried perfectly though.  Overall: This will probably be my new go-to place to satisfy pho cravings! The place is cramped and super busy, so don't have high expectations for the service or ambience. Still, it's worth checking out for an authentic bowl of pho!"
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,3,21-May-15,"I was excited to read the glowing reviews of this place and got my expectations high.  I grew up eating pho in Canada (both Toronto and Vancouver) where you just cannot miss the numerous pho restaurants dotting the cities. So my standard of good pho is what you get from any pho place in North America. There is just no bad pho over there and it is a staple food in every Vietnamese family there.  First off, the chairs are most uncomfortable. The stools are too high for me to eat off the table easily, I felt I was bending over double just to eat, and I am a short person. Then the combination of air conditioning and fan going gives two types of temperature. You get the cool air followed by a blast of warm air, it is most disconcerting.  I ordered the sliced beef and brisket pho with extra beef balls. The soup is tasty though I wish it also comes with a side plate of bean sprouts and basil and slice chili and lime for customer to add to it. The meat is terrible. I cannot see or taste the brisket at all, and the meat is very chewy and tough. Such a big disappointment. The beef ball is good though I cannot tell if it is handmade or from a machine.  The summer tea takes some getting used to. I will suggest to stick to the Vietnamese coffee or something.  The service is good though. Bring cash. I do not remember if it accept NETS. Definitely no credit card facility here.  At the moment, I think Pho Tam Anh at Chinatown Point is better for pho."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,1,23-Dec-20,"When there to dine on 22 Dec 2020 around 2pm Throughout our meal, both waiters (1 male 1 female in their mid 40s-50s) were speaking to each other in vietnamese, commenting on our appearance and making fun of our food choices. They made some pretty mean and rude comments on regarding our looks thinking we could'nt understand what they are saying. Don't dine here if you dont want to have their staff member talking shit about you behind your back."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,3,14-Oct-19,"Just mediocre Vietnamese food (appetizers, pho, more). I've given this place several chances and I'm just over it. There are much better places in town that are worth your cravings. Meh!"
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,1,16-Jul-16,"Food taste - authentic Price - reasonable market rate (chicken / beef Pho: SGD7.90) Ambience - Just like typical Vietnamese restaurant, but just half a shop, so very noisy and crowded. Seating - Just stool. non back support so have to finish fast and leave. Not suitable for pregnancy woman and children   Tips: Avoid weekend especially Saturday, the soup finish by 8pm yet the shop close at 10pm. So everyone don't get any soup based stuff except Asam soup based (in the picture) and spicy beef soup. BBQ pork Rice and dry vermicelli still available.  No Tax (GST) but charges 10% for service charge (the usual) Charges service charge but had to go to counter to pay bill. So the only service they do is to bring your order to your table, doesn't justify the 10% service charge."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,4,27-Feb-16,"This is probably a 3.5 star place, so I'll round up for generosity.  Hailing from Melbourne, with a massive Vietnamese population (and having had two Vietnamese ex-girlfriends!), my judgements of Vietnamese food are always benchmarked against what I've had back home.  Which means I'm usually disappointed here in Singapore.  We ordered pho special (dac biet), Vietnamese ""Assam laksa"", some goi cuon (fresh rice paper rolls), and a couple of drinks.  The goi cuon was good, fresh, with a great sauce.  Pho was good - probably best I've had so far in SG - but still not ""Melbourne good"". Of course, it was a damn sight better than the ridiculously overhyped, overrated and overpriced NamNam. It was missing the depth and ""roundness"" of flavour that I love about pho. Generous with meats, though I missed the bits of Vietnamese sausage, tripe and beef tendons that I've come to expect.  The Assam laksa was a bit unusual, complex flavours, I wasn't a fan.  Service was good, friendly and fast. $30 for two of us. Tables are literally 4-6 inches apart from each other, so not the most pleasant ambience. Overall worth a try.  I just hope people stop going to NamNam."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,4,6-Mar-16,"I'd say B¨²n Tht Nng is way better than Nam Nam. I'd prefer to have more herbs than cucumber though. Chicken pho also delicious, with lotsa herbs & soup is full of flavor. Vietnamese coffee was just ok. Not fragrant enough. I love the small table outside the shop with stools... So much like how the locals eat by the roadside in Vietnam! All in all, food is pretty authentic and value for money."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,4,8-Feb-17,"Great and popular place for Vietnamese food. Need to go early or some dishes get sold out quickly. The queue takes a while and we were unlucky that some customers in the place next door were smoking heavily. Nevertheless, the food was worth the wait. The lemongrass drink was refreshing. The pho with soup was very tasty and my friends were pleasantly surprised by how addictive the cockles were. Definitely value for money and worth repeat visits!"
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,4,7-Jan-19,"Sugar cane prawns ($3.90) - 2.5 stars It tasted a bit too sweet and artificial (as if they used those frozen prawn balls instead of fresh or frozen prawns).  Cockles stir fried with garlic AND LARD ($7.50) - 2.5 stars Not my thing - I find cockles kind of smelly and pungent - but my friends loved it.  Sliced beef noodle soup - 4 stars Good pho! Not sure which beef pho dish we got but it was delicious. The soup was flavoured just right, the noodles had the right texture, and the beef wasn't too tough.  Stir fried beef noodle with lemongrass ($8.90) - 2.5 stars My least favourite of the noodle dishes we had. The beef was too dry and tough and there wasn't anything else in the dish to make up for that.  Special beef combination noodle soup - 4 stars Not sure which bun dish we got - it had spring rolls and meat balls. The meat balls were amazing! Soft, juicy, and flavourful.  The best Vietnamese food I've had in Singapore. Nam Nam's got nothing on this."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,1,19-May-18,Pros -Good food -Food arrives quick -Nice interior -Cool menu with pictures -Affordable  Cons -Rude af waitresses. What are you doing? -Thai iced tea is all ice. Ask for a cold one without ice or you'll be paying S$3.50 for a glass of ice. -Pho was very average.  Go somewhere with better service. The menu and interior were the most redeeming parts of this restaurant.
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,3,14-Dec-15,"This used to be my go-to place for authentic pho in the town. A year ago, I would've given it 4 stars, but the standard has dropped. The beef pho, pho ga and bun are just OK (sometimes, the pho broth is tasteless) but it's still better than the overhyped: Nam Nam.  Some things never change and those are the starters/sides. The chicken wings, beef balls and fried spring rolls are pretty good and I LURVE the cockles (they say it's fried in garlic but really, it's half a piglet of lard). The fresh spring rolls are hit and miss.  This place can VERY crowded during dinner. Best to go before 7pm. After 8pm, many items might be sold out.  Eating there isn't the most comfortable. Chairs are too high for the table so your back will hurt if you linger. And they have this annoying habit of forcing 2 people to sit at two-top even when the restaurant's not crowded. Tables are SMALL. With the sauces, cutlery, pho bowls, side dishes and drinks, you practically need to sit at another table to eat. But hey, rules are rules.  Cash only. No booze on the menu but I've seen the owners break out some Tiger around closing!"
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,10-Oct-15,"Their pho is goooood. The place is tiny industrial-cool, dim in a hip kind of way, and that kind of squished that makes you feel real cozy with your companions and all the people a table over.  Food was really quite delicious. Try the chicken wings and beef balls too! Watch out when it comes to drinks though - I found the salty lemonade a little too salty and sour for my taste and the iced tea is a ""cooling herbal"" kind.  Definitely come before 7 if you don't want to wait.  ~$9 for a sizable bowl of pho. Mrs Pho is here for your next pho/Vietnamese noodle craving."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,3,17-Sep-15,"First time to Mrs Pho on a weekday lunch and the place was packed! But people were leaving and we got a table very quickly. Food order is easy - write your own order sheet which is available on the table and then proceed to the counter to place them.  Very soon after, our pho arrived. Though I would have preferred to have our starter of papaya salad come first, it came a bit later.  We ordered the simple beef pho $7.90, my personal benchmark of a good pho. To be really honest, there was hardly any beefy aroma when the bowl hit the table. Taste wise, broth was rather mild as well. I am used to a stronger beefy broth and would have liked more than the couple of token mint leaves and herbs to add more aromatics. Oh well. A squirt of hoisin and hot sauce and a squeeze of calamansi lime were added in an attempt to lift up the taste. Better but still short of what is good. Nonetheless I do appreciate this more than Nam Nam's version (which I feel uses lots of artificial seasonings).  The papaya salad was very good though! Just papaya, a few shrimps and a good dressing and topping of shredded pork, fried onions and crushed peanuts. $6.50   The table for two pax is rather small, given that all the condiments are provided (which is a good thing and convenient) but do take up a bit of space. Our 2 bowls of noodles, 2 drinks and 1 appetizer took up every area."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,18-May-15,Best pho in Singapore! I've been to Nam Nam which did not impress and Mrs Pho takes me back to Vietnam and all the Vietnamese restaurants in the US. The place is not big - I didn't make reservations but only had to wait 10-15 minutes for a table to open up.  We ordered the following and they were all delicious: Hanoi meatballs - great sauces Chicken wings in fish sauce - perfect crispiness Sliced beef & brisket noodle soup (pho) - yummy! Vermicelli with pork & spring roll - can do with more pork
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,6-Nov-16,"The best and most authentic Vietnamese food in town. The broth of the Pho is excellent. I recommend the braised beef version. The spring roles with pork and shrimp are a must have, they are well complemented by the sauce. You may need to ask for more sauce! The food was served very quickly and the decor was interesting. Will go back again as I hear the meatballs are amazing. More to come :)"
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,3,30-Sep-17,"This place has almost reached cult status with Singaporeans; it often runs out of ph in the late afternoon/early evening, so we wanted to try it out. The ph broth is pretty flavourful, but it is NOT served piping hot as it should be; the 'special' version only has beef brisket and beef balls, but no raw beef or tripes; and the beef brisket is rather chewy. The mini clams is cooked with a delightful garlic sauce and served with sinful but scrumptious lard. The chicken wings are below average. Venturing to the toilet shows how unhygienic part of the back section is. Next time, we would try newly-opened Ph C? Hai on the same block of Beach Road. Or stick to Long Phng in Joo Chiat which is much better, more authentic and with a more diverse, longer menu."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,4,24-Jun-16,"When i'm in need of a comforting bowl of Vietnamese Pho, i'd naturally head to Long Phung in Joo Chiat for that warming noodles in beef broth. I've never been disappointed by their bowl, but it's always good to have a backup in case they are closed or when i'm not near the East. So here is another trusted alternative- Mrs Pho.  Mrs Pho has been on my food list for a bit because it has been recommended by trusted foodie friends like Miss Tam Chiak and Superfinefeline. So after several half baked attempts to visit (despite being in the area), Jr and i finally dropped by for a taste test.  Standard side order of Goi Cuon ($3.50 for 2). Thin and chewy rice paper rolls filled with rice vermicelli, slices of prawn and pork belly, paired with that 'chee cheong fun' sauce.  Now on to the star, their Pho! Have the Pho Bo Tai ($7.90) Sliced Beef Noodle Soup or the Pho Dac Biet ($8.90)- Special Beef Combination Noodle Soup. The former is a no frills bowl that comes with thin and tender beef slices, while the latter has meatballs, brisket, beef, and a half cooked egg. I thought the beef balls were very authentic and indeed they are freshly shipped from Vietnam weekly! As compared to Long Phung, we think that Mrs Pho does a more delicate bowl of noodles with milder flavors. Of course, you can always spice it up with the accompanying fish sauce, lime, and chili. If you are not for beef, there's also Pho Ga ($7.90) Chicken Noodle Soup, and Bun Mam ($8.90) Assam Seafood Noodle Soup. and other vermicelli and rice dishes.  Start or end your meal at Mrs Pho with the Iced Ca Phe Sua Da ($3). I thought it was rather smooth and not too sweet really! The Avocado Smoothie ($4.50) was decent too. Now i know where to head to for a perk me up in the Bugis area! A good Ca Phe Sua Da is so hard to come by in Singapore. And of course, the pho.  Come here if you can't take Joo Chiat's grittiness, Mrs Pho is definitely more for the young hipsters."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,22-Jun-17,"Legitimately the best pho I've had in SG, sample size of about 10 places. Definitely recommend standard pho, fresh spring rolls and the lemonade. Always packed on a not-so-busy location, so it has to be gud.  ***update*** Don't get adventurous here. The best thing on the menu is the pho. Trust me. If you need more, stick to spring rolls. I've tried several items now. Although, instill need to sample the chicken wings..."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,1,14-May-19,"Stopped here on my way home from the office. Asked for a beer, no beer. No problem. I asked for a cup of water with my Pho. Was told only mineral water available. I left and went elsewhere."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,4,17-May-17,"Very good pho, neat atmosphere, sassy but good service.  Came for lunch on a saturday and was very pleased. The coffee was great (both hot and iced), the spring rolls were delicious, and the pho very very good. I don't recall the name of the one i ordered, but had brisket in it and I ate every bit of it. Will definitely return.  Note, they only take cash"
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,3,20-Feb-16,"It's fresh, fast, good and with reasonable prices... What else? Mrs Pho is one of the only places to serve up legitimate Pho and some of the classics dishes like Papaya Salad.  The semi-hidden restaurant is small but beautiful in a post industrial decor. Nothing complicated, just enough to feel like going back.  If you're coming for lunch, don't be surprised to queue... The place is often crowded from 12 to 2pm."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,15-May-17,"Dear Mrs. Pho,  You are my strength when I am weak You are my voice when I can't speak You are my eyes when I can't see You see the best there is in me Lift me up when I can't reach You give me faith 'cause you believe I'm everything I am Because you love me  Happy Mother's Day.  -----  By far the best pho in Singapore.  FOOD (must try): - Beef combo pho **will update with more visits**  SERVICE: - fast - don't expect much else  COST: - $ (10-15 per pax) - cash only  OVERALL: - fast dining - good food - best alone or any size group - busy, so go during non-peak hours"
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,15-Jun-19,"I didn't try the pho, but we did get quite the selection of appetizers which were all phenomenal. Yum. I'd definitely go back and recommend to anyone. Good prices too."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,21-May-16,"Passing through Beach Road and hungry for some lunch was how I came across Mrs. Pho. I was greeted with the sound of people slurping their pho and distinctive Vietnamese chatter from the staff....great start....additionally it was 2:30 in the afternoon and the place was packed! Although the pho appears to be the must try, I was craving a rice plate so I went with the Com Suon Cha. Before I even get to the food, I just want to say that I was surprised to see how reasonably priced the items were. Nothing over $8, and the bowls of Pho I see coming out of the kitchen all looked huge. Anyway on to my food, The pork , eggs and the Vietnamese ham combo all blended in real well. Portion was just the right size, you won't come out overly full. I also opted for a fresh spring roll appetizer. I'll have you check out the pictures for yourselves. It was real authentic and took me back to Vietnam and San Jose hahaha. My only complaint....I wish the would add more items as I'm sure Mrs. pho would make them so well! Apart from the food, I liked the decor of the restaurant, very rustic and modern, in keeping with the interior design of most places around Haji lane. I'll definitely come back here and review the Pho!"
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,2,20-Jul-16,"Tasty food at a reasonable price, especially for this area. 5/5 if it's just for the food.  However, have experienced poor service almost every time, whether dining in or calling in to order takeout.  If only there was some way of getting the food without having to interact with the staff/storefront."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,3,8-Jun-16,4 stars for the good food but minus a star for the service as one gets the impression that they want you to eat as quickly as possible and leave.
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,19-Jun-15,"Word. All I'mma say is don't come here. It's crowded enough go away. Kthx...  This place is a legit, Vietnamese-run and Vietnamese-filled noodle shop. It's basically a kopitiam but with air conditioning, complete with tables so close you can hear your neighbor slurp.  I came in at 7.30pm on a Friday and every dish on the first page of the order chit was sold out except the chicken pho, which also got crossed out after we ordered the last 2 bowls.  Not going to say much more. Shhhhhh...."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,27-Sep-18,Best pho in Singapore hands down. What dish do I reccomend? Everything. Most of the soups and noodles I've eaten here are great. I love going with friends and ordering different ones to share.
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,3,10-Sep-18,Salad was good. Spring roll sticking to each other. Pho was average. Am I crazy? Service was fine. No rudeness to be detected. If you like a hipster vibe over food this is for you.
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,3,15-May-17,For some reason pho tastes different in Singapore versus the States. This place is better than others in the City but I found the broth lacking in overall depth of flavor. The Pho Dax Biet was 9.50 and came with a small side bowl of broth with a partially cooked egg in it. I thought that was strange. The staff is quick to take your order and usher you out. Napkins are 30 cents extra. Overall I'd return but don't expect pleasantries or any sort of customer service.
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,14-May-16,"The packed-every-night little place says it all doesn't it?  The food is very affordable. Super awesome setting. Totally casually and pretty darn authentic too.  The Pho? What more to say. Almost as good as what I had in the streets of Vietnam. The fresh spring rolls were delicious and disappeared into the depths of my tummy pretty quickly. I love the glazed wings, juicy and tasty.  The drinks could improve. Coffee was not great and could be better but meh. Was not a huge deal. Service with a smile and all at a good price? It's all good.  Be prepared to wait for a seat guys!"
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,9-Jun-15,"Never thought I would be a fan of Vietnamese cuisine until my colleague brought me here! I never liked soup. And it's quiet rare to find vietnamese restaurant that serves many varieties in their menu other than pho and banh mi.  Here my fav dish is their pork chop and their spring rolls. I eat here at least once a week for lunch with my colleague. To avoid long queue (and if you come with a big group of people), come at 12 sharp or even before then."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,5-Nov-14,"Coming from LA, it's very hard to lower my standard for vietnamese food! Forget about NAMNAM, what's up with the long lines every single day?  I should say this place has the best pho in Singapore!  There is not much space in this cute restaurant but you can expect awesome ambience with nice hippie deco around every corner. Super authentic and original!  Nearest MRT: Nicoll highway! It's along the shophouses across Sultan plaza and opposite of Concourse building.  Avoid lunch and dinner time to prevent yourself from having to wait to be seated. Best to come after 1 or before 12.  I'll be back!"
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,28-Nov-15,"Excellent food, casual and nice ambience with some quirky details in its interior. We ordered Pho Dac Biet and two starters and they are so fulfilling. Located not far from the hip Hj Lane, Arab St, it's a nice option when you're in the neighborhood."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,16-Apr-18,One of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants. It has character and it's authentic! Love the beef broth! There's also chicken options for non beef eaters. Must go!
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,26-Mar-18,I wish this place could be next to my house. :). Ordered a bun & spring rolls. Both were superb! Flew all the way from the US to try this place as it happened to be close to my hotel! Didn't have time to go back. Wish I got to try more stuff from the menu.
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,4,24-Jun-16,Love the Pho and spring roll. Make sure you come ahead of time before the queue formed. :)
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,4,21-Aug-18,"Great place to stop for lunch if you have limited time. Excellent pho, quick service and friendly staff."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,6-Sep-15,This is a great place for street food style viet ! It's cosy and very homely. The pho and soups were great. Definitely will come back
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,30-Aug-15,This is a great place for street food style viet ! It's cosy and very homely. The pho and soups were great. Definitely will come back
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,4,3-Dec-14,"Don't tell your friends about this place!  Just kidding. This place is packed on weekdays - come by 12noon for lunch if you want to get a seat and not have to wait in the queue.  The pho was delicious. The noodles and the broth were excellent. I wish there were more greens (basil, mint) with the pho. I'm not sure why there weren't more.  Aside (IMPORTANT QUESTION): I've had pho in other places (usually overseas but at actual Vietnamese-run small shops) and often you get a whole plate of greens and taugey to add. Or is this a Vietnamese-American thing? I've had actual Vietnamese people tell me conflicting things - is it a regional thing? If you are Vietnamese from Vietnam and can explain this, please tell me!"
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,4,30-Dec-16,Best Vietnamese food I have tried in Singapore. The coconut smoothie is unusual and the best I have ever had anywhere. The dry vermicelli is excellent. Arrive early because this place is packed at lunch time. Definitely great value for your $$$
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,1,8-Jan-20,"Went there and waited at the table for 10 minutes, waiting for a waiter to come and take our order. Turns out that you have to pay FIRST before you can eat. They charge for tissues. And they only serve bottled water. Grumpy cashier and manager. Walked out without eating. Wont be going back again."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,1,27-Aug-19,"Came here as a tourist from America and was thoroughly disappointed. The waitresses and owner were just outright rude and yelled at us for asking for some lime. We asked for waters as well and they rolled their eyes and walked away from us. Food was not very good either and they tried charging us more than what we ordered, thinking we were tourist and unaware! Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone looking for"
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,2,24-Jun-19,"Came here as a tourist from America and was thoroughly disappointed. The waitresses and owner were just outright rude and yelled at us for asking for some lime.

Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,3,28-Jan-15,"I didn't like the food as much as I'd hoped. It doesn't feel as authentic as Lung Phung in Joo Chiat, but if you do not want to hike to the east, maybe it is the best available option.  The space is cute though. It try to emulate street eating in an air-conditioned environment. We do see Vietnamese eating there so it may be more authentic than the other Vietnamese chain stores in the city."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,15-Aug-19,"Excellent food, good prices, fast service. We enjoyed it so much we even came back a second time"
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,4,25-Dec-16,"Decent pho, may not be like the pho back home but decent. The most important part of pho is the soup. It was alittle sweet but every one has a different taste. The spring and summer rolls are good but I think the chicken wings are awesome. Portion are alittle small for guys, if your a dude and extremely hungry, you might want to order a second dish or pho as a back up."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,13-Nov-15,What a pleasure surprise! This was the best pho I have ever had. The broth was packed with so much flavor. We went around 3pm so there was not a big crowd. It was also when the staff was eating their lunch made by the kitchen. You know food is good when their own staff eats there. Pho were $7.90 to $8.90 in price and the portions are great. Be sure to check this place out!
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,2-Dec-15,"Amazing food! I came here with a friend and we ordered the beef pho special, spicy mango, spring rolls, star fruit juice, and an avocado smoothie. The pho was delicious - you get a lot for what you pay for. The spring rolls were fresh and bigger than I expected. They come with a peanut sauce. The avocado smoothie was tasty. I wanted to try star fruit juice and the spicy mango out of curiosity and wasn't in love but if you already like those things I'm sure they're good. I would strongly recommend this place if you're looking for pho for a very reasonable price! We ordered two entrees, two appetizers, and three drinks for S$56 and gratuity was included."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,3,9-Nov-16,"The food is quite nice however, the coffee was a disappointment. The coffee wasn't good and doesn't taste authentic."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,6-Jun-15,"Fantastic. The fried pork spring rolls and meatball appetizers were great. I had the sliced beef pho, while a little bland initially it's was spectacular when I added a little extra siracha and soy, which I prefer to it having been to salty or spicy to begin with. Also the flavor increased as the steak cooked into the broth. My friend had the spicy beef soup, something I didn't try it but he seemed quite happy. My other friend had the beef noodle stir fry which I did taste and I think it is the best Vietnamese stir fry I have had, which is quite high praise as I would never consider ordering something besides pho at a Vietnamese place until now. Prices were good, a little under $60 for all three of us with several appetizers and drinks, etc. All left full and happy."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,4,23-Feb-16,"The traditional fare at Mrs Pho may be a little clunky, but had a rustic, homestyled, authenticity to it. And although a squishy tiny place, service is speedy, friendly, and helpful. Our dishes arrived barely 5 minutes after orders were taken, in quick succession.  We ate:  1) Cha Gio ($3): lovely chunky texture, with wonderfully juicy porky flavours.  2) Nem Nuong ($3.50): decent, but failed to leave an impression, in light of the most amazeballs minced patties in Hanoi just earlier this year.  3) Pho Ga ($7.90): delicate enough, but missing in richness of depth. A tip is to ask for extra lashings of basil and mint, essential in making it all come alive.  4) Bun Bo Hue ($7.90): a hot and spicy beef noodle soup laden with stewed beef that was so-so, and a fantastic Vietnamese ham  5) Bun Bo Xao Sa ($7.90) - chilled rice noodles tossed in a peanut-onion dressing, and topped with beef slices stir-fried with lemongrass: must-try and the best thing here, with its clean and clear and crisp flavours"
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,23-Aug-14,"We love this Vietnamese restaurant. It's a relatively new establishment but it already has heavy traffic even on a weekday. Do reserve and go early to avoid the queue and the disappointment when you're told their pho or spring rolls are sold out. Yes, I know. We have the experience of being told they ran out of herbs for our pho on a Saturday lunch, and served a bowl of pho with just the beef. The waitresses and waiters are not very experienced but they are very friendly and helpful.  We love the beef pho, fresh and fried spring rolls, my sister and her hubby told us the chicken pho and spring roll vermicelli are great too. I think the pork chop rice, chicken wings and meatballs are quite average but my nieces loves them. They also have the best avocado and coconut smoothies. Finally a place that doesn't add tones of sugar into their drinks. If you like your drinks sweet like my nieces, you should try their herbal tea instead."
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,19-Sep-14,Very beautiful small restaurant with very friendly Service and delicious soups. Try the fresh spring rolls -yummi.
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,5,14-Jan-15,We were never satisfied with the pho we've had until we've tried mrs pho. They are closer to what pho tastes like in the bay area and it is reasonably priced (cheaper than most pho places in singapore) give the salted lemon drink a try!
Mrs Pho,3.8,59,Vietnamese,3,27-Sep-16,"first off, the decor is awesome, it really reminds me of an upscale hipster version of vietnam - from the rotating fans to the short stools, it has a really authentic street feel.  everything was good but not great. the ONE THING I REALLY DISLIKE is that their soups don't come with any fresh herbs!! that's the best part of vietnamese food, piling on the bean sprouts, thai basil, mint - you dont get ANY of that here. a breakdown of my meal: - spring rolls: good except the noodles were way too overcooked and tasted like mush. but aside from that, loved the shrimp and the peanut sauce - green mango: really traditional. literally just green mango with chili powder. i enjoyed it but someone that didn't grow up eating it might find it underwhelming or odd. - pho dac biet: just ok. i really wish the broth was richer and more flavorful. i ended up adding a lot of lime, fish sauce and peppers to compensate. - bun bo: i actually enjoyed this dish, i think it could've used a little more shrimp paste but overall i thought it was good. but my biggest issue is that it was missing a LOT of traditional ingredients - no cha, no pigs blood, no CABBAGE.  this place is... authentic vietnamese adjacent. however, i haven't had too much vietnamese food in sg but from what I hear, this is probably close to as good as it will get, so for that i'll be back."
Violet Oon,4.3,13,"British, Hainan, Singaporean",5,9-May-24,"Excellent service, spectacular food and peaceful ambiance.  Visited this location at Orchard in December 2023.  Food was prepared with very fresh ingredients and immaculately presented on the platters they were served in.  We ordered chicken satay, Beauty salad, beef rendang and fish curry with roti. Also enjoyed fresh watermelon and basil juice and ginger beer.  Would definitely recommend this fantastic establishment."
Violet Oon,4.3,13,"British, Hainan, Singaporean",4,27-Jun-24,I tried this restaurant in ION Orchard. I had Dry Laksa. It's very tasty! Worthy to try!
Violet Oon,4.3,13,"British, Hainan, Singaporean",4,10-Apr-24,Beautiful setting and comfortable service! I wasn't a fan of the dry laksa but perhaps owing to personal taste. I would return to try other options however.
Violet Oon,4.3,13,"British, Hainan, Singaporean",5,13-Jan-23,"On my trip to Singapore, I decided to frequent this restaurant. If you want to eat here, please make a reservation in advance!  I decided to order the vegetable curry with roti parata that has the most moist paratas. They were a family favorite! If you want more paratas just order extras on the side. I did and devoured all of them. Next I ordered the beef rendang, beef hor fun and udang goreng chilli. The beef was tender and melted in your mouth. However, the prawns in the udang goreng chili was too spicy for my palette but definitely tasty if you can handle the spice! Finish off your meal with the gula Melaka cake! I will definitely be back on my next trip to Singapore! So obsessed with this place!"
Violet Oon,4.3,13,"British, Hainan, Singaporean",5,6-Feb-23,We didn't know what to expect when we sat down at this restaurant in the middle of a mall. Not your typical fine dining locale but because of how it's situated you forget the throngs of people that are out of view.  The beef rendang is a favorite dish of mine and this one was incredible. Great flavors and texture. We tried several other dishes and really enjoyed most of them. We were told that the tastes aren't "traditional" so when you come here don't expect the same old flavors of classic dishes.  We had a great time and I highly recommend eating here!
Violet Oon,4.3,13,"British, Hainan, Singaporean",5,17-Aug-22,"Violet Oon seemed to be always packed whenever I passed by the restaurant. Finally after years of passing by and wondering what was the hype, I caved in and checked out the place for lunch especially after my hair stylist at Leekajah mentioned about Violet Oon and he liked the food there.  Firstly, do not try to walk in and thinking there would be a table for you. Reservation is the key. I have seen someone turned away by the staff when she tried to walk in. Staff informed her the restaurant was fully booked till 1.30pm. Alas!  SERVICE 5/5 Staff here were very polite, super friendly and hospitable. They checked in on us throughout the lunch and dessert and at the end of our meal. Water was never half filled, water was constantly replenished. The attentiveness of the staffs here deserved a 6 star.  FOOD 5/5 I ordered the Beef Hor Fun (flat noodles). The meat was large pieces of very tender beef. The sauce and flat noodles were delicious! Extra gravy was offered on the side. My sis who has been here often recommended this dish. I have to say my sis is indeed our mom's daughter. She has a good palate too.  Shepherd's Pie 5/5 My bestie ordered the Sherperd's Pie. I was given a spoonful to try. The mashed potato was so smooth and creamy. The beef fillings was rich and tasty.  We also ordered a dessert to share. Pulut Hitam with Coconut Ice-cream- 5/5 Pulut Hitam is malay word for black glutinous rice. It was cooked to perfection. Creamy and so yummy.  Guess Violet Oon deserved that hype. Definitely not cheap eats but worth a visit or two or whenever one feels they deserved a good meal with top notch service.  08.15.2022"
Violet Oon,4.3,13,"British, Hainan, Singaporean",5,25-Jun-23,"Situated inside the mall at Ion Orchard. We almost missed it. We were expecting an enclosed restaurant just to find it smacked right in the middle of the mall, just like a food court but just by itself. I've read good reviews about it and we just had to try it. It was a recommendation by one of the staff at JW Marriott and it did not disappoint. We were first greeted by a male wait staff who led us to our table. Thereafter, it was Jean who took care of us. We already knew what to order as we had a sheet of paper with the recommended dishes. Jean was very knowledgeable and recommended other options based on our taste. We didn't think we could handle the dry laksa, and recommended the tiger prawn pasta instead. There was a roti dish that was only available at their National Kitchen restaurant but recommended the fish curry with roti prata as an alternative. Both turned out to be really delectable. One of us don't eat curry but she enjoyed the fish curry. The serving size would ordinarily be enough for one person. But if you order multiple dishes like us, one would be enough to share and sample. Ironically, the location looked like a food court but it wasn't ""noisy"" and still gave out a ""classy"" vibe, thanks to the professional wait staff. It was all in all a very pleasant experience. Would definitely come back when in Singapore!"
Violet Oon,4.3,13,"British, Hainan, Singaporean",4,12-Nov-22,"My favorite high tea in Singapore. I love their version of high tea. They put a twist on all the little appetizers and the food. It was slightly difficult to make a reservation so book early. Everyone at the table must get the same set of tea but the food was so good, it can't be beat!"
Violet Oon,4.3,13,"British, Hainan, Singaporean",4,25-May-23,"If you are looking for a place with good Singapore nonya food at a good location with good ambience, come here. The food are all pretty good but the menu can get confusing if you don't know what you are ordering. Can get a bit pricey but everyone is nice and the food is great. Do recommend getting a reservation if possible as it can get a bit busy during rush hours."
Violet Oon,4.3,13,"British, Hainan, Singaporean",4,22-Mar-22,"dinner at violet oon, ion last night. i actually quite like the food here, it's the cheaper version of candlenut.  good peranakan food in a nice, comfortable setting. the portion's generous too. we ordered beef rendang, ayam buah keluak, chap chye and ngo hiang. all eaten with jasmine . satisfying meal."
Violet Oon,4.3,13,"British, Hainan, Singaporean",4,7-Feb-23,"This outlet offers a subset of the menu of the National Kitchen by Violet Oon at the National Gallery. So if you are expecting menu range, you will be disappointed. Other than that the quality is consistent."
Violet Oon,4.3,13,"British, Hainan, Singaporean",4,20-Mar-19,Take away is.... would i return... YES! Rendang... nice. kelauh a tad sour but like the way they smooth out and stuff it back it. Lodeh pretty good. Keuh D D unfortunately was served a little cold inside. Tasted ok but the texture of the wrapping too smooth. Perhaps a new rendition?
Violet Oon,4.3,13,"British, Hainan, Singaporean",3,2-Sep-20,"If all of a sudden you're having a Peranakan attack while shopping at ION, you might come here. The food is not bad. Otherwise, for a really satisfying experience, go to the Violet Oon at the National Gallery, or the Peranakan at nearby Claymore Connect, or Candlenut at Dempsey for a modern twist. They also serve non-Nonya dishes like shepherds pie. Ambiance and service are more casual Caf¨¦ style than restaurant."
The Dragon Chamber,4.9,11,"Chinese, Singaporean",5,14-Apr-24,"So good, came back for lunch the next day. They offer happy hour from 11-3 and 5-6:30. Everything they do is top notch. I didn't get it, because I don't like shrimp and scallops, but the ramen presentation is top notch. They make their ramen in house too. Or they wouldn't be able to do it that way. The beef pineapple also had a beautiful, firey, presentation. A little more fat in the meat than I like. But I had plenty of lean meats too. The fried rice was on point. I could have made a meal out of it."
The Dragon Chamber,4.9,11,"Chinese, Singaporean",5,12-Apr-24,"This unassuming Chinese restaurants in China town is known to have some of the most authentic and creative Chinese food in Singapore. Everything was done wonderfully. Very creative presentations. We didn't try it. But highly recommend the ramen. The presentation alone was wonderful. They make their own noodles here, to be able to do it that way."
The Dragon Chamber,4.9,11,"Chinese, Singaporean",5,11-Mar-24,"Walk by the Dagon Chamber and you'll see a seemingly bored woman sitting in a barren, sparsely-decorated dining room. Hidden in the back of this speakeasy is one of Singapore coolest restaurants. Walk through door posing as a faux beer cooler to be greeted by the real restaurant - dimly lit with electric highlights.  While the speakeasy theme and trendy d¨¦cor introduce you to this hip spot, the food is what will keep bringing you back. The firecracker chicken is aptly named - crunchy and extremely hot. Cheeseburger rolls and Flaming Pineapple Beef were fun. But the star of the show was the Wagyu Beef Truffle Hor Fun - one of the best dishes I have ever had."
The Dragon Chamber,4.9,11,"Chinese, Singaporean",5,2-Jul-23,"Amazing experience overall. It is a restaurant speakeasy whereby you go through a hidden door to get to the restaurant. Once inside, the decor is very eclectic. The presentation of the food is very good too whereby they mix the noodles in front of you - the wagyu truffle beef hor fun and the soft shell crab and Hokkaido scallop crispy noodles. It was very entertaining. The D*** soup was very flavourful if you can get past the ingredients. True cheeseburger rolls were tasty. The firecracker chicken was not my favourite as it had that mala spice which is so numbing that you can't taste anything. The desserts were good as well."
The Dragon Chamber,4.9,11,"Chinese, Singaporean",5,29-Mar-24,"The Dragon Chamber was a unique experience. Love the mystic, the red entrance door, the food and service. Would definitely recommend trying this restaurant out!"

The Dragon Chamber,4.9,11,"Chinese, Singaporean",4,16-Oct-23,Crispy chicken was stellar! Such a fun restaurant. We were here for the f1 race and enjoyed the entire dinner.
The Dragon Chamber,4.9,11,"Chinese, Singaporean",5,30-Oct-22,"The most amazing Chinese fusion restaurant in a cool, speakeasy environment. The flavors were exceptional and everything we ordered was delicious. Highly recommended!"
The Dragon Chamber,4.9,11,"Chinese, Singaporean",5,18-Jun-22,Cool speakeasy vibe in a trendy environment; this restaurant has solid Asian fusion throughout its menu. I enjoyed the truffle hor fun a lot and that was my favorite dish. Expect to pay about $30 per person for just food and everything is family style.
The Dragon Chamber,4.9,11,"Chinese, Singaporean",5,9-Jul-19,The uninitiated might just eat the wanton noodle and move on. I had no idea what I walked into when my friend proceeded to open the huge deli case. I would describe this as fusion Asian with a retro secret society ambiance. We had the signature Wagyu beef truffle hor fun with a side of kai lan and lemongrass jelly for dessert. The beef was excellent and very flavorful. If you love food with intrigue this place is for you.
The Dragon Chamber,4.9,11,"Chinese, Singaporean",5,30-Oct-22,"What a cool experience! Great environment, fantastic food, and great service. You want to take pictures constantly."
The Dragon Chamber,4.9,11,"Chinese, Singaporean",5,7-Jan-21,Secret restaurant hidden behind a fridge! Great ambience. Great food. Perfect for little gatherings. Seats are limited so would recommend to make a reservation prior. one of a kind experience
Astons Specialities,4.4,7,"American, Steakhouses",4,26-May-23,"Very reasonable pricing for a steak experience. On a biz trip with light budget. After eating Asian food for 4 weeks, I needed a taste of the US. This menu fit the bill. Would be better if it had a bar, but beer and wine ok."
Astons Specialities,4.4,7,"American, Steakhouses",4,23-Oct-17,"If you're looking for Morton's, you've come to the wrong place. But! If you're looking for affordable steaks, fish or fried chicken (!!!), in a pleasant environment, this is your place!  I usually get the Prime Ribeye/Xtra cut or New York Strip with baked potato and steamed veggies. The Crispy Fried Chicken is also amazing!  The mushroom soup was a little too thick and tasteless for my liking. The house wine wasnt bad. Service is quick and friendly."
Astons Specialities,4.4,7,"American, Steakhouses",5,24-Oct-19,Aston's does not skimp on quantity.  Aston's does not skimp on quality.  You'll get so much BANG for your BUCK here that it's almost unbelievable. The steaks are cooked beautifully and are accompanied by a motley crew of side dishes that are also a delight to the senses.  PEW PEW! PEW PEW!  Whoa. Did you hear that? Sounds like an AWESOME-RESTAURANT-LOCATER-GUN and it has its crosshairs dead set on Aston's.  Come here... or... don't...  ... but you really should.
Astons Specialities,4.4,7,"American, Steakhouses",5,6-Aug-15,"Great place to have dinner / lunch.... good food at good price. I went there many times with my wife. I liked their steaks, I tried different ones, all of them tastes really good. Usually there's a long queue in dinner time... keep ~20 minutes in hand."
Astons Specialities,4.4,7,"American, Steakhouses",5,9-Jun-19,One of the best places to have a weekend or Friday evening dinners. Food is alright. Price is value for money. Have not missed having dinners at Aston's. Keep up the good work! We will visit again. Just live your sides. Tasty and fabulously delicious. Trust me. Try their fish and chicken meals. Only set back is the drinks in the meal deal are a tad bland. Just my two cents worth - improve this and you will be an awful restaurant. As you know drinks is an important part of a meal. Hope you improve this and you will become a great restaurant joint. Other than this Aston's is our choice restaurant for a long long time. We will not hesitate to recommend to anyone and everyone who is hungry or just want a table to have a meal.
Astons Specialities,4.4,7,"American, Steakhouses",3,6-Aug-12,"Affordable, delicious and unpretentious steak. That's what you get here at Astons. While they do serve up a mean array of grilled chicken and fish, the main focus definitely has to be on the steaks that are comparable to many other restaurants, albeit at a much cheaper price. Service is fairly efficient, though they've gotten the doneness of my steak wrongly a few times. But they rectify it almost immediately once you get their attention. Must haves are their porterhouse cut and ribeye steak with extra cut. I've been dining here for years when I'm lazy to dress up to eat elsewhere or when I just don't feel like spending a lot on food."
Astons Specialities,4.4,7,"American, Steakhouses",5,17-Jul-12,"I've always seen mad long queues at Astons and always wondered if the queue was well justified. I had to find out of course on a day when there was no queue. I ordered the honey bourbon ribs. It was fabulous. Above my budget for the dish at $24.50 but damn it's great. The meat slips off the bone like melted butter. The honey flavour on the meat really accented the sweet flavor of the meat. The dish came with a wonderful side dish of mashed potatoes that worked pretty flawlessly with the meat. I also ordered a vienna sausage which was really the dish that stole the show. A small simple sausage dish that you must try to have a clue why i would give this place a 5 star rating. My iced chocolate was the only thing i have to complain about because it was fantastic but there was too much ice in the drink. So by the time i had a 3rd sip, the drink was over. Best part about this place, the food came in approximately 10 mins. Astons is a great joint for a good meal."
Soi Thai Soi Nice,4.8,4,Thai,5,29-Jan-23,"Had an assortment of plates to split with a friend. Had the local fish, fried pork belly, saut¨¦ed bok choy, and Tom yum soup. I also had a coconut milk dessert that was lovely.  Everything was excellent and prepared well! Once you are done, you can pay your bill at the front."
Soi Thai Soi Nice,4.8,4,Thai,5,6-Jul-17,"Two of us have Royal Thai Hot Pot, $38.80 (for 2 pax). We op for raw eggs instead of hard boil eggs and ask for extra spicy soup.  The ""zingy"" flavour is satisfying (but not fiery even for extra spicy), all together with the generous ingredients will give the broth a nice flavor.  The Thai-style omelette have a crisp borders and soft center with multiple soft inner layers. The taste, texture, and smell of this flavored yellow thing is flawless!  Will definitely visit again to try other thai food!  http://dayre.me/celestialdelish/VcBNK01Y9Q"
Soi Thai Soi Nice,4.8,4,Thai,5,10-Mar-19,"This is by far, the best thai food restaurant in west side of Singapore ! The taste is next level delicious ! Food came in real fast the staff was friendly as well !"
Soi Thai Soi Nice,4.8,4,Thai,4,2-Sep-18,"Food is good. Nothing out of the ordinary but it was decent. The mango sticky rice is a must. The experience would be perfect if their service would match up to their food standard. It wasn't bad, I just expected more from the price I was paying. Overall a decent place to get some legit Thai food in Singapore."
Marukyu,5,1,Japanese,5,22-Sep-14,"In a street where new food establishments seem to pop up every week it is nice to find a place that does not follow the trend of being hip for the sake being hip and not being a Korean BBQ restaurant. Don't get me wrong - I like Korean BBQ. I just don't need 20 of them on my doorstep.  I digress. Marukyu is an upmarket Japanese restaurant. Prices are at the very top end for the area but, thankfully, so is the raw materials and food preparation as well. I had the sushi bent box (very reasonable price) and everything, from the grilled cod, via the sashimi to the sushi rice tasted great and was perfectly cooked. (The sashimi wasn't cooked - you get my point.  I look forward to come back and try the fuller menu in the near future. I hope I'll be able to keep the 5 star rating - I love japanese food."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,24-Mar-23,Delicious all vegetarian food. We stopped in for breakfast when only a limited menu is available but it was amazing.  We had paratha korma and an onion masala pancake type of thing. The korma sauce was amazing and the paratha was buttery and crispy. The onion pancake was amazingly flavorful and came with a tasty curried potato hash in the middle and sauces on the side. The veggie soup it came with was fine but the sauces were all very intricate and nuanced. I ordered a masala tea to go and it tasted just like what you'd get from a street vendor in Mumbai.  Prices were very affordable and the ambiance was great.
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",3,14-Sep-23,"Komala Vilas is a super popular Vegetarian Indian restaurant in Singapore's Little India. I came here with two Indian colleagues and trusted them to do all the ordering. The food is Southern Indian, so expect lots of variations of bread, curries, chickpeas and other dips. Despite the restaurants large size, there was a line of folks waiting to get in after we left.  * For me, I enjoyed the Andhra Thali Plate with the huge variety of dishes. No way a single person can finish this monster platter. My favorited were the Rasam (Tangy Tamarind, mildly spicy soup), Coconut Curry, and Eggplant. There was some powdery, spicy dry curry that packed some serious heat. I had to use the yogurt dip and rice pudding as neutralizers.  * Beverages were great - mango lassi was thick and sweet, while filtered coffee was bold and smooth and good end to the meal.  * The one toilet on the second floor was somewhat ok in terms of cleanliness, but had way too much water in the floor.  * Service was friendly but inattentive at times. Instead of napkins, they give paper towels from the sink. Most of the tine, its self service.  With half of the Thali plate and a sampling of breads of various shapes, textures, dips and fillings you will get very full from this Vegetarian meal. After all, ""Man cannot live on bread alone."""
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,19-Sep-23,"We got off at Little India during the Big Bus tour and we were hungry, wile at the Indian temple I asked a few locals and they pointed me here. There was a line out the door and then I found out that this was Singapore's original Dosa place and all the locals have been coming here for years. Originally all They sold was Dosa but now they serve many other South Indian veg dishes. Yeah the food was good, the service was satisfactory and the ambience feels like I'm in India. Mango lassi was excellent"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",2,27-Apr-24,"Would have given this place a better review but they were very discriminating in their service. We ordered two plain dosai dishes, a fried rice dish, cauliflower and garlic naan. As we ate we watched them serve additional side dishes and paneer to all the indian tables and not once did they ask us if we wanted any... they pretty much avoid our table unless we waved them over for something. Disappointing to say the least. As for the food it all tasted good but seamed that for the sauces we only got the sauce while I noticed that others with the same dishes actually had more substance and the dosai for us came out as a flat while the presentation on others was a nice rounded log. Wouldn't recommend going here for tourist unless you understand the language and look indian. Very disappointing. I'm reluctant to even give them the two stars.'"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,10-Aug-23,"We enjoyed the friendly service and food here. We ate tomato uttapam, masala dosa and plain dosa. Also, palak paneer. Palak paneer was too good. The paneer was just like you get in my mom's kitchen. The lady taking the order is quick to write down orders. She didn't realize we ordered dosa thali and not dosa plain so one order was wrong."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,16-Nov-22,Came here because it was 4 stars on Yelp. Had the Masala Dosai (mashed potato crape) and Mango Lassi (Mango yogurt drink). Tasty and inexpensive. Staff was nice enough to recommend them as something a non-Indian person would like or is safe. Everyone was eating with their hands but they gave me a Fork and spoon. Don't sit too long. It's a place where you eat and leave. Tables next to me kept turning over.
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,23-Jan-20,"Was craving dosa and only about a 30 minutes walk from the hotel. Not many places open early in the morning in Little India.  Ordered the pongal, upma, Mysore dosa, uttipam, and mango shake (they didn't have any lassis in the morning.  Very delicious and made to order. Was the only Caucasian within miles and loved it! :-)  For sure will be back when in the Singaporean Little India area."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,5-Jul-19,I asked an Indian friend of mine for a recommendation where to eat in Little India. She told me to go to Komala. And so I did. I felt a little foreign but the staff helped me to the best available to understand the many menu items.  Don't ask me the three items I ordered. All I know is that one was mushroom but they were really good and I enjoyed the many different flavors.
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,19-Sep-19,"Komala Vilas is a nice Indian vegetarian restaurant in Little India that satisfied our hunger around lunch time.  Space can be a little cramped since it was busy and we ended up scaring our table with another patron.  The food was delicious. I'm normally a guy who needs meat in his meals, but the wife was craving vegetarian. I ordered garlic naan with mushroom mutton and she got the onion uttapam with three sides.  The garlic naan has visible bits of garlic covering it, but surprisingly not overpowering with flavor. I wouldn't have minded a stronger punch of garlic, but I do love garlic. The mushroom mutton was also very tasty and not overpowering as far as flavors go. I probably could have ordered another set of naan bread to finish the mutton with.  The uttapam was a pancake-like food which we ordered the onion version of. It's like much thicker dosai with a topping of your choice. The sides were really good and my wife especially liked the curry one. I personally liked the spicy one. The white one reminded me of a cole slaw.  We finished the meal with a mango lassi which was refreshing. Not overpowering with the yogurt flavor which I appreciated.  You can tell a lot of locals cane here to eat which was a great sign. Thankfully they also had a sink with soap to wash your hands since the meals are eaten by hand.  Overall really good experience and we would come back again"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",3,21-Dec-16,"I looked up restaurants in Little India on yelp and wasn't disappointed.  It's completely vegetarian, so I was a bit surprised that there are no chicken or lamb dishes on the menu. I ordered the vegetable ""meatballs"" in a masala sauce. Very tasty! Had it with garlic naan and a mango lassi.  My husband had the Chappati meal which consists of different kinds of curries and sauces. Each one was nice, but not noteworthy.  We enjoyed our meal, but could have used something a bit more substantial. I love plant based foods, but it's nice to have meat curries as an option too. For me personally, I enjoyed my meal, but just wasn't in love with it."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,6-Oct-17,"A entire restaurant full of vegetarian options is usually an easy win for me, and this place definitely delivered. The food was really good, and the staff here were really friendly. The prices are very affordable, and the portions are large. The food does look deceptively small on the menu photos, so I ended up ordered way more food than I needed, but was very happy I got to try a little bit of everything."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,14-Jun-15,"Ever since I found Komala on yelp, I was craving for Indian food. I couldn't wait to try their food. I don't have much knowledge comes to Indian food but I know it was a good meal under S$5. Even tho it was all vegetarian, it left me content. The drinks are rather expensive compared to the prices for the food.  I was very very happy until I saw the sign says C hidden under the cashier counter....lol Fortunately I didn't get a stomache but I really don't wanna think about what goes on in their kitchen."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,1-Oct-19,"Finding a friendly and fast South Indian / Tamil restaurant in Singapore shouldn't be that surprising I think. So yes, I was not surprised by anything at Komala Vilas. And apparently it is a pretty old restaurant which used to be good. I'm glad to tell you they are holding up pretty well.  The food was overall pretty good. We tried everything from the spicy ""Podi Dosa"" to the soft idlies and to the foot tall ""Cone dosa"", which was unsurprisingly, shaped like a cone. They all tasted pretty darn good and consistent. The chutneys could've had a little bit of variation. They all tasted pretty much the same which kind of got old pretty fast.  The best part about the meal was the glorious filter coffee. It was bitter... just so darn bitter and sweet - exactly how South Indian coffee should be. It was a perfect way to wrap this breakfast up.  Will drop by again when I'm craving some nostalgia."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,14-Jun-17,"Went there for lunch after a long day of exploring Singapore so we were really hungry. Tried the Palak Paneer, Aloo Gobi Masala and Plane Dosai. Overall we liked the food a lot. The palak paneer was my favorite. Also got the naan (butter and garlic). I thought the butter naan was better. I wasn't the biggest fan of the sauces with the dosai. We also tried the samosas. The crust was a bit too thick and not very flaky. The service was good even though they had a lot of customers.  Food: 4/5 Service and atmosphere: 4/5 Price: 4/5 Overall: 4/5"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",3,14-Jun-17,"Opens at 7am, so good for breakfast if you don't have something at a hotel.  Ok for inexpensive breakfast. Had the poori set, which is 2 poori and 2 dal. Filter coffee was ok. Fine in this area where a lot of places aren't open early."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,26-Oct-18,Awesome South Indian vegetarian food. Great prices too. Highlights were:  Butter Masala Paneer Aloo Gobi Masala Dosa Garlic Naan
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,28-Nov-15,"So I'm visiting Singapore and everyone has told me to visit little India - sure why not but I want to eat some good food here as well. So I ask my native friends to take me to a place that has good food and hello, here I am.  When you walk in you know it's so authentic. There's a sink to wash your hands cause that's all you're gonna be using to eat with. Just the atmosphere and everything. Oh man.  You've got to try the MANGO LASSI! Most I've had in America have been overly sweet but this. this was on point. Yogurt + Mango and the perfect amount of sweetness.  So onto the food. We ordered Butter Naan and regular Naan and split several of the dipping dishes between 5 of us. We ordered 5 dishes and boy they creep up on you. I was so full by the end of the meal. To be honest after a while all of them started to taste similar to me - but I have low spicy tolerance and it was probably more of that speaking. I'm terrible at remembering names but there was this one dish that stood out that was green (I believe spinach / pea mixture). Anyway if you figure out which one that is you should try it :) Big hit with our table."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,1-Jan-16,"In town for 8 days on business and one of my co-workers had a local friend who suggested this place as its where the Singapore PM bought Indian Prime Minister Modi for lunch, when the later was visiting Singapore. Hey if it's good enough for Modi, it's good enough for me.  One tip - strangest journey to get to the loos - you walk thru the kitchen and the dish washer and there is only 1 unisex toilet and the floor was covered with water! So definitely avoid trying to go to the loo here.  Food wise, this is a South Indian place so you can't go wrong with Dosa - however if you can't tolerate too much spice like me, just let the servers know because I didn't and my dosa came laden with green chillies! The sambar was truly lovely as was the coconut chutney. Not that big fan of the tomato chutney. Loved that you could get second helpings of the sambar and chutneys as well as the subzi for free.  The local folks we were with got an Andhra Plate. I can't recall if this particular item was available only on weekends or just Sunday's but gosh, that plate was turbo loaded with food - no dosa include in this however, unfortunately!  Would def return as good food at great price and free second helpings"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,8-Feb-16,"Dosai meal ($8.50) - 3.75 stars Vegetables (left to right) - long beans, potato, banana Sauces (left to right) - green chili and coconut, red chili and onion, daal, tamarind sauce, cardamom dessert Masala dosai stuffed with a potato curry This was absolutely massive. It would last me 2-3 meals at least. Thank goodness I didn't order the paneer butter masala. Could definitely share this dish. The first two sauces on the left always come with dosai according to the manager/owner and the tamarind sauce usually goes with rice. Everything tasted good! I suppose I didn't give it 4 stars because I was a bit tired of the dish 1/6 of the way through.  Masala tea ($1.80) - 4.5 stars Loved this. Spicy and not sweet. There's sugar on the table for you to add.  Ambience - 4 stars Down-to-earth, homey, and clean. You share a table if you're alone/in a group of two, which was nice. I ended up chatting with a young Sri Lankan couple who knew more about Indian food than me!  I'll have to come back to try the paneer butter masala and the spinach dish."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,17-Feb-18,"People are ridiculous for giving less than 5 stars because they want meat. It's a vegetarian restaurant. If you aren't ok with that go elsewhere. Pretty simple but I guess it's too confusing for some.  We loved our meals here! We (1 adult + 2 kids) were on a budget so we skipped drinks and used the pitcher of water at the table. For $15 USD we managed to get really good meals for all of us. If we had more to spend we would haved ordered more, but it's good to know what you can eat for less in Singapore. We were upstairs and did have about a 15 minute wait for a table. I didn't mind since a busy restaurant typically is a good sign. Not sure if the experience differs on the first floor. We will be back next time we are in town!"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,21-Feb-18,"The first time I ever went to Singapore, over twenty years ago, I got there very late at night and after spending the night at my hotel near Orchard Road, got up early the next morning and took a taxi to Komala Vilas on Serangoon Road. This was the first of many many visits with the most recent one being in late 2017. I sat downstairs and ordered idlis, a medhu vada and upma and then totally relished my wonderful breakfast.  For those who do not know what an idling is, the answer is that it is a white colored soft discus shaped slightly sour cake, generally 3 to 4 inches in diameter, and made with fermented batter (like masa for tamales) using a mix of soaked rice and daal (lentils). Medu vadas are savory fried donuts made from the same flour. Upuma is a savory version of cream of wheat, cooked in ghee and with bits of fried curry leaves, onions, mustard and fenugreek seeds with bits of dried and green chilies plus chopped green coriander leaves.  By lunch time, I was craving the food at Komala Vilas again and upon getting there and learning about the special unlimited meals in the upstairs section, climbed the stairs and sat down at a marble topped table. In a few minutes a server placed a banana leaf in front of me with many small steel bowls. Another server came by and filled the utensils with different South Indian vegetarian preparations. I was served rice, papadums, sambar and rasam and after asking for a fork, started attacking what was in front of me. Never having expected to finish all my rice, I was surprised when the server came around for more to find myself welcoming another helping. It is unlimited and they will keep serving you until you say enough. The stomach will get filled even if the palate will keep wanting more.  I have enjoyed this experience so many times without tiring of it, often to the frustration of my wife who would like to try other terrific restaurants, Indian or otherwise on this magnificent gastronomic gem called Singapore.  My big frustration is that if Komala Vilas in Singapore can serve such delicious and perfectly prepared South Indian food, why can't other similar restaurants outside India, particularly those in the US do so? Even if some copy Komala Vilas' name they fail to replicate its food. If only the original Komala Vilas decides to expand to the San Francisco Bay Area, life could be so wonderful."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",2,25-Nov-18,"Every Indian person I know from Singapore couldn't stop telling me how amazing this place was. So on a jet lagged morning I strolled in to taste the Masala Dosa and idli. The Masala Dosa was no good, no taste and the sambhar lacked your expected South Indian punch. The Idli was good, but I mean it's idli..... two points for the Chutney... if you want to eat better South Indian breakfast, hold on to your gut and try Anadha Bhavan or Sarvana bhavan. If you're upset with this opinion, I understand, I'm spoiled by years of tasteful masala dosa and Idli, this spot just didn't do it for me."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",2,12-Mar-16,"For breakfast they have a very limited menu. I came at 10:30am and was recommended:  Masala dosa 2/5 - potato-curry-stuffed dosa. Lacking in flavor. The three sauces were lacking as well. BIG portion.  Samosa 3/5 - texture was right, but it was also lacking in flavor. Even when dipped in the chutney, still not satisfying.  Service was unfriendly. My coconut took forever to come out, leaving my poor mouth burning til the end of my meal.  After reading great reviews, I was really looking forward to this place! But, you get what you pay for: cheap, mediocre Indian food."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,28-Apr-16,"My boyfriend and I discovered this gem while traveling through Asia for a month. The fact that we are here six times during our trip (generally during layovers between countries), it's safe to say this was our favorite restaurant. Komala Vila is located in the heart of little India. When you enter the restaurant the staff will seat you downstairs or escort you upstairs depending on capacity. Then you'll wash your hands because you won't find utensils here!  The dish that kept both of us coming back was the Masala Dosa. The masala dosa is a crispy crepe rolled up and stuffed with potatoes, peas, and delicious spices. It's paired with three different dipping sauces. I have no idea what they were or what they were called but the yellow one is delicious!!  If you're in the mood for something sweet order a mango lassi drink. It's a creamy yogurt based drink infused with fresh mangos. I'm salivating just thinking about my experiences at Komala Vilas."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,8-Feb-18,"Incredibly delicious vegetarian Indian food! Nice family run place, since 1947. Reasonably priced, nothing fancy, and filled with ""locals"". Had the potato curry and Chana masala with fresh baked burrita (think that's the name) bread that was the size of a child's head! Food was not killer hot (spicy hot), just pleasantly hot accompanied by a thick sweet mango lassi. Flavors were incredible. Loved it so much came back twice during a 10 day stay. BTW - I'm not normally into ""vegetarian"" anything! But after eating here I could take that path! Samosas were hot spicy as they were loaded with peppers. A piping hot Chai masala was a nice way to end my meal. Do NOT miss if in Singapore! PS - be sure to bring your own napkins!"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,1-Oct-19,"Komala Vilas located in Little India in Singapore serves authentic, flavourful Indian food!!!!! It's a vegetarian restaurant that serves amazing curries as well as classic Indian breads!!! A must try is the thosais which are massive long thin crunchy crepes that can be filled with a lot of things such as potatoes (masala thosai) or onions!!!! Another must try is their vadai which are the donuts that are fried to perfection!!!!! Their poori is so light and fluffy and definitely worth trying!!! All their breads, thosais, vadai, etc. pair excellently with the curries that they are served with!!!!! They even have traditional Indian desserts like gulab jamun!!!!! Their mango lassi is also very thick and has a lot of delicious mango flavour!!!!! The restaurant is split into two floors with the upper floor being for rice dishes and the bottom floor being for breads and thosais!!!!!! This place is a definite must try!!!!!"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,15-Dec-14,"Vegetarian Indian at its absolute best.  This place is located along the main road of little India. I dined alone, and was greeted by another solo woman diner. She was so lovely, sat with me, told me how long she'd been going to this restaurant and insist that I try the chai. She even poured it for me.  I ate the best samosas I have ever eaten in my life here. Ate 3 plus chai for less than 10 SG$.  This is my happy place."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,30-May-17,The food here is similar to what I tasted when I was in India. The masala tea smells good and reminds me the journey in India. Lots of people here especially India people. Maybe they can heal their homesick by eating their traditional food. The servants are a little passive because they are too busy I guess. Try if you want to feel like being in India. No worry about using hand or not. They provide simple tablewares.
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,27-Mar-18,"Really delicious, authentic vegetarian South Indian food. I tried the Masala Dosa, Uttapam, and Samosas and all were delicious and cost less than $20 even for so much food. Only downside is that it's cash only."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,3-Nov-14,"Fancy a sampler of all sorts of delectable Indian breads? Look no further, Komala Vilas has got you covered!  Everything we've tried over several trips has been delightful, but my two favorites are the crispy Cone Dosai and the puffy, nearly soccer ball sized Bhattura. No matter what kind of meal you try, it's guaranteed to be wallet-friendly and delicious with well paired sauces.  I'd recommend washing the whole thing down with a delightful lassi and maybe ordering a Paneer Butter Masala as an extra dipping option for your bread.  Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty as they have sinks with plenty of soap on the first floor.  Service is friendly and fast.  PARTING THOUGHT: I like sprinkling sugar on the crispy Cone Dosai...it reminds me of the tissue prata at Nasi Kandar shops in Malaysia"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,10-Oct-17,Visited this tiny hole in the wall outpost a few weeks ago during my singapore trip. Chose to sat downstairs where you get the choice of alacarte menu. The feast served on a banana leaf was not only scrumptious but brimming with good taste. The only problem I felt was the way to the restroom was through their kitchen and not at all clean as per Singapore's standard. Perhaps use the restrooms in the mall close by and come here to enjoy good food:)
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,10-Jan-13,"Well I have a lot of fond memories with this restaurant. I have been here during my every visit to Singapore in last couple of years. Located in Little India this place has been around for a long time. This is no frill authentic South indian food spot. The food comes out quick, is reasonably priced.  They have a lot of options on the menu but me and my family would always order the traditional masala dosa with comes with sambhar(lentil soup) and coconut chutney(cocunut sauce). Definitely a cool spot to hit when in singapore and looking for some authentic ethnic south indian food."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,29-Apr-13,"Uhm...$4 tomoto onion uthappam with 3 sides?! Yea, I'm down! Not only was it good, but the place had AC and the menu actually says what these items are made of. I didn't know that uthappam is just a thicker version of dosai, of which dosai is made of semolina (which is gluten free, a nice plus). I came here basically for some good indian vegetarian food and it didn't disappoint. Restaurant setting with hawker prices :)"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,24-Oct-16,"It's not clean, partly because it's super busy. Be prepared to wait. But the food is amazing. Dosa fresh and not oily. Bhatar (I think that's how you spell it) was killer. We really over ordered a lot. A lot! And it was less than $40 for three people total and was the tastiest meal of our week long trip.  No alcohol or meat available. Amazing veg food!! Excited about returning."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,29-Jul-19,"A pretty solid place to get South Indian fare. I'm pretty picky when it comes to my paper masala dosai (note: its original Tamil name). I've been here 2 or 3 times, and I do think it can be hit or miss when it comes to the crispness and airiness of the actual dosai. However, I've had great Madras filter coffee, sambar, and thayir vadai. Would definitely recommend taking a trip down to Komala Vilas and Little India for the good food and prices."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,5-May-16,1) Cone dosai $5.50 sgd Wow super cool very big and fun to capture in photos Very light and crispy Good appetizer dish for 2 2) We also ordered the bharum drink $3 Nothing special Sweet as expected Bright orange color  4 stars goes to dosai only
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,9-Mar-14,"I had visited Komala Vilas on my trip to Singapore. The restaurant has two stories. The lower floor sells sweets as well as serves some customers. The upper floor is where I think there is full service of customers.  I took my colleague (who is originally from San Francisco) to this place a couple of times. We ordered masala dosa, bathura chole, parotta and kurma during the first visit. What can I say? Excellent! He enjoyed it too.  On our second visit, we ordered the lunch meals, which was prepared well and plentiful. All in all, it was great tasting South Indian food.  A couple of things - South Indian food is meant to eaten with hands mostly. They have a wash basin to wash your hands. But it would be great to keep it a bit more cleaner. Also they take only cash. If you don't have cash, there is an ATM at a store ( a few feet nearby).  I am docking them a star because of the slightly dirty wash basin. I will definitely be back and highly recommend this place."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",3,21-Nov-17,"It was our first night in Singapore and decided to give this place a try as it was pretty late in the night. The food was ok, nothing fancy. The restaurant wasn't very clean. If you're famished and don't have many options late in the night, this is a good place to grab a quick dinner."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,19-Jun-15,"The first Indian place that I visited when I first came to Singapore back in 1991. Says a lot about the longevity of this place. This still has the most inviting banana leaf meal with everything in a free flow mode (most places only allow curry and rice for free flow). Simple, as close to home food. Nice filter coffee. Kids love the big ball bhatura or the cone dosa. Wife likes the crispy rava dosa.  Pleasant taste on the tongue and not too big a bite into the wallet either."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,21-Nov-15,"Wow, what a great lunch. Found this place unexpectedly walking around and via Yelp saw it was likely a good place to stop. The ghee onion dosai was excellent, so was the service."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",3,9-Jun-19,"This little, Indian cafe has garnered quite a name for itself within the Little India area in Singapore, and when my friends and I were wandering around the area decided to give it a try since we were craving Indian food. I got the Masala Dosa ($4.40) which is a crepe-like bread filled with potatoes and onions, and three dipping sauces on the side. One appeared to be yogurt based, another with chili peppers in it, and then another that was similar to curry. The food itself was barebones delicious, and even at around 4pm the restaurant was packed. There were side boxes for to-go samosas that also looked delicious. The menu is hard to understand if you aren't familiar with authentic Indian cuisine, but everything is so good and the pictures provide a lot. We were in and out quickly even though we ended up sitting down, and is a good place to take a quick meal/snack break while wandering around Little India. However, bathroom is fairly hard to get to, so keep that in mind when visiting, and they often squeeze people very close to each other in the dining space. Otherwise, a great, authentic and local place to get Indian food in the area. Additionally, the restaurant is completely vegetarian, so take note meat lovers!"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,11-Jan-17,Great vegetarian restaurant and the dosa's are great! I haven't had one in a while and they are just the way I remember them but better. They are light pancakes with crispy edges. They taste better with your hands so dig in! Oh and order the mango lassi. You won't be disappointed.
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,30-Aug-14,"I was craving some Biryani and so I headed up the stairs of this old-school restaurant on the edge of Little India. Order from a small menu at the entrance, pay cash, take your seat and in a few minutes you get a tray full of delicious goodness, hot rice with all sorts of vegetarian curries, naan, and spoon/fork combo, if you're a foreigner. Look, I don't understand what the big fuss about how to eat this - with your right hand as a local or with a fork like I've been used to. The end result is all the same. So leave me in peace while I enjoy my Biryani, purring like a Bengali tiger. My tastiest, fulfilling, and most affordable (less than SG$10 with a bottle of cold water) meal in Singapore."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,18-Dec-17,Very nice vegetarian Indian restaurant. Tried the chick pea chili dish and it was excellent.
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,27-Jul-13,"Probably some of the best Indian food you're going to get in Singapore will come from Komala Vilas. They've come a long way in the last few years, since a visit from 2007 had left a lot to be desired, but the recent one was definitely one to remember.  All the food is freshly prepared - you can taste it - and the service is very good as well. I recommend getting the uttapam or the dosas, and if you're into more custom/delux dosas, try the paneer butter masala dosa. It's really divine.  The one other awesome thing is the prices. You can go feed an entire family of 4 there for under 20-25 bucks easy. And we're talking good portions, awesome sambhar and chutneys, and the whole nine yards! Definitely a great place to visit for Indian fare!"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,19-Aug-17,Solid. I got the lunch deal. So much food for $9. I'm not a local so I don't have a good comparison.
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,12-Aug-17,Great food with only Indian locals. We had the rice and chapati meals and various small sides and all were great. 7$ per person for a more than filling meal
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,30-Aug-13,"I had some great food at a really great price and there was a lot of it. It was everything I wanted in an Indian restaurant.  I will say, though, be prepared when you go in there. The restaurant isn't set up to cater to tourists."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,20-Jul-13,"An update- The review below is for the Serangoon Rd location. There are actually two other Komala Vilas locations within a couple of blocks of this one. I had a meal at the Race Course Rd location, and it was just as good as the one on Serangoon Rd. The Race Course Rd location features some ""Jain"" Indian dishes - I was planning to try some of those, but they looked to be more ""ala carte"" than the other selections, so I just got one of the combo meals (didn't even have to ask and they brought out another portion of one of the dishes).  I walked by the location on Buffalo Rd, and it was filled with tourists (in contrast to the times I've been at the other locations)."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,13-Jul-13,"Ok, I'm from Madison, Wisconsin, USA, so what do I know about Indian food? Not much I guess, but this place is awesome. I've been to Singapore twice and each time I've come here I've been impressed. Though its not clear on the menu, but I think for most dishes you get unlimited ""refills"" if you ask (so ask!) And yes, the only other non-Indians present are people who frequent sites like Yelp looking for authentic non-touristy places. Ask for a fork (chopsticks I can do. Fingers? No...) If you're into sweets they have a few, but the also have a bakery next door on the corner where they have even more."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,7-Feb-13,"This is my first review. I hope i'm rating the right one since the other Komala Vilas on a different street was not as impressive.  I had kottu here (shredded chappati, said to be a dish that originated from home where leftover chappati are used for this purpose) and it was really good. I liked the ambience and would go back again to taste the rest of the menu."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,17-Jul-12,"This is one of my most favorite restaurants in little india. It's 65 years old in 2012 so this place has been around for awhile now. They provide lovely vegetarian food from which i would highly recommend the ghee rava dosai and the parotta set if you would like some thing light for lunch. For dinner I would go for a paneer butter masala with some naan. The drinks here are particularly amazing. Go for an ice milo, a rose milk or a sweet lassi. They are all pretty sweet both literally and metaphorically."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",1,11-May-17,"I've lived in Singapore all my life and I used to visit Komala's Villa with friend and family. One time, I was treated so poorly when I was there with friends from out of town, that we politely got up and left, but I vowed to never return. I had a friend from out to town visiting so I decided to try out Komala's again after 10 years. Bad mistake. Service is still rude, arrogant, and lazy.  I had a friend visiting from the USA so I stupidly took him to Komalas. Not used to the heat. The man at the end of our table kept the water to himself so I reached over to the other table to grab some water. The staff walked over, removed the water from our table and returned it to the empty table. I guess empty tables are more important than paying customers. He did it on purpose to be mean and rude. He never came over to refill our water and ignored us the whole time we were there. We never got a refill of rice or dhal and were basically rushed out the door. There were no more customers for the day so he just wanted us out.  We were not the only ones who had to raise our hands and wait for service. There are 10 staff members to each customer, but each is more surly, rude, and arrogant than the next. I think they treat the regulars with respect. Everyone else, they treat you like ""we got your money, now leave."" I left frustrated and angry, but I had to save face in front of my guest.  I try to support local businesses, but Komala's Villa, I cannot support. I work hard to treat people decently and with respect. They work hard to remind you that they are an institution and that they don't need your money. It was like this 10 years ago, it is like this today, and if you look at the other comments on this page, I'm not the only person who thinks this way. Obviously they don't care. Be forewarned. You can get better food without the attitude. Stay far away from Komala's Villa. It's just a tourist trap now. Unlucky for the tourists!"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,11-Mar-17,"Love this vegetarian Indian restaurant in Serangoon. They provide great foods and fast service. I frequently go there when I visit Singapore. It never lets me down. I specially like their Poori, Bhatura, Rice meal, Dosa's and Biriyanis."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",1,3-Oct-16,"Hi  I bought a veg-briyani t/way on 3 October 2016. My bill number is 357. I went to the outlet at Buffalo Road at 4.30 pm and was told to come back at 5 pm. As told, I did return to place my order at 5.17 pm. To my dismay when I consumed the meal at 8.30 pm, I realised that the rice had a strange odour. I then realised that it was already spoilt. Thanks for the wait and returning faithfully to purchase a vegetarian meal for $9.00 which is spoilt within a span of three hours from collection.  I will not even consider patronising your outlet anymore based on my bad experience today. This is not my 1st time experience with your take aways.  I am truly disappointed.  You can reach me at alpal242617@gmail.com and I can forward you the bill for your reference.  Thank you."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,13-Mar-18,Delicious food. Service is okay. Not the cleanest place I have been to but that's to be expected.
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,17-Mar-15,"I had lunch here and enjoyed it a lot for quite little money. The place was full of locals which I took for a good sign. staff was really friendly and helpful and the service incredibly quick. The food was tasty as well and as far as I can judge quite authentic. It is all vegetarian so no meat, but all the tastyness does not make you miss it at all!"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",3,3-Jun-15,"I feel like I went to the wrong place, the reviews here are way off. I had an average masala dosa, and a substandard masala chai. The vada however was excellent. I was treated like an outsider, struggling to get extra anything while the servers made sure all the Indian clientele had everything they needed. Wouldn't go back; plenty of good looking alternatives on the nearby side streets."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,28-Oct-13,"had to fly halfway around the world to get a taste of the legendary komala. wasn't the easiest journey; found myself trapped beside a leathery old chinese guy hacking tubs of sputum at 120db every five minutes on an old Air China 737 but this damn food is worth every mile and then some.  i went local and ate with my hand(RIGHT HAND, TYVM) but i may as well have just put it in a kiddie pool and splashed around. needless to say my face lost the battle but my stomach was the true victor.  butter paneer masala, 40 kinds of dosai(sadly i missed the cone dosa), chenna masala, tomato uttapam, bhatura the size of a watermelon, the list goes on....just plain marvelous. and as a special treat at this location only, MILKSHAKES. the mango milkshake was pure divinity, i didn't know whether to drink it or put a ring on the straw and slide my dick into its creamy depths. until i can get across the pond again i'll be dreaming of the otherwordly delights from the baddest of the bad, k-vilas!   JCTSFR: NaN"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,9-Feb-16,Much food. We got good service and guidance. Even asked us for refill. Great tasteful vegetarian food and awesome mango lassi. Will go here again soon.
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",1,8-Apr-18,"Food cannot be tried by other people you are dining with, this is the first time I have experienced this. I have been going to Komala Vilas for years and the service has always been good however, I had the worst interaction today with the service staff and was shocked. I had lunch with my sis and mum today. I ordered an Indian rice meal while the other 2 had dosas. Mine arrived first and both of them took a bite to try the food which was all they did. When I asked for an extra helping of the vegetable curry (which is the norm), I was told due to our sharing my food I was not eligible to get more food. The person attending to me was a manager so I explained that they had ordered their food and were just waiting. He served me the curry without issues. However, when I asked a waiter he absolutely refused to serve me until I raised my voice. I am DISGUSTED and SHOCKED. I have been a loyal customer since I was a child and go to the restaurant at least once a month. I even know some of the servers by face and name. This is the first time I have had such a miserable interaction and it spoilt my lunch. I am definitely going to stop recommending this restaurant to my non-Indian and foreign friends unless the service improves."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,25-Feb-16,"Just excellent vegetarian Indian food! Definitely recommend, got some assistance from waiter to give us a wide variety. Mango lassi also on point"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,17-Aug-17,Very authentic South Indian vegetarian restaurant. Don't be shy because there might be no other Caucasian guest.
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",3,30-Oct-17,Despite of very good reviews the quality of food is quite average. Good value for money though.
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,13-Jul-17,"Very tasty dosas with 8-10 veg toppings. Nice family style seating, excellent mango lassi. Good value"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",3,11-Apr-15,"For the price they charge the food is pretty good! But the ambience is very dull, hopefully a renovation will get it more business!"
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,26-Sep-13,Excellent authentic south Indian vegetarian food. The food is extremely good and I've been here atleast a couple of times each month to have a filling meal. The prices are very nominal and hardly costs 10 SGD for a full filling meal.
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",3,14-Jun-14,"Went to Little India and ate at Komala Vilas. The place was almost full but I did not have to wait for a table. Sat down and was helped by a freindly waiter. I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable and out of place, it kind of felt like I was not welcome. I ordered the tomato and onion uthappam and it was delivered to my table with silverware. As everyone around me had been staring in my direction since the moment I sat down I heard one person comment ""They brought him a fork!"" I proceeded to eat my dinner with only my right hand and then washed up in the back, paid, and left.  I would give the food itself a four stars as it was flavorful, however, the overall experience was not very enjoyable and for this reason I will probably not be going back."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",3,25-Aug-14,"Get here early and ask for the Pongal. It's warm and mushy (I mean that in the best possible way) and perfect comfort food. The rice is soft and flavourful and studded with black peppercorns. It goes really well with the tomato chutney it comes with. Also try the masala vada, the mango lassi and obviously end with filter coffee."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",1,25-Mar-15,The standard of food has dropped so much. The thosai tastes so bland n the chutney is equally bland. what happened to komalas? disappointed. the food tastes like hospital food.
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,21-Nov-15,"A friend was visiting Singapore for the first time and we were showing him around. For dinner, he wanted Indian food so we thought where else can we go but Little India. Plus it was Diwali and we thought it would be festive to go at night and see all the traffic of people and the decorations. We searched online and decided on Komala Vilas coz it was so highly rated by a large number of reviewers. Also, wanted vegetarian for a change. We went during dinner time on a saturday and there was a small line waiting, the line moved pretty fast though since this is a fast food/diner kind of place and people just eat and go. We got the paper dosai, the cone dosai and the veggie korma curry with garlic naan to share. I really liked my veggie korma curry as it was the perfect blend of creamy, sweet and spice and went very well with the naan. We saw everyone ordering a tea drink so we also asked for it after the meal. It's kind of like teh tariq as it's tea with milk but less sweet and you have to pur it back and forth into a little bowl to mix it. I failed miserably the first few times and kind of made a mess but that was still a lot of fun. The tea drink is delicious so I'd recommend you to get one if you are there. Service was efficient and we finished our meal within half an hour to move on to mustafa center, very good stop for some snacks when you are visiting Little India."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",5,2-Jan-13,"While living in New York my husband and I discovered South Indian cuisine and particularly fell in love with the dosai. We had a dosai guy and ate there probably close to once a week. So when moving to Singapore we immediately sought out of dosai fix. Once we found Komala Villas we never looked back. The eatery is split between a more casual ground floor caf¨¦ with desserts and light meals and the upstairs restaurant. The big draw aside from the dosai is their rice meals. You get unlimited rice and curry for $7.20. Yes, they have raised the price a couple bucks since we first came but it's totally worth it. Everyone in the restaurant is using their hands and speaking in Tamil or other Indian dialects. We get plenty of strange looks when we show up. However, much like to trick of eating at a hawker is to stand in the longest line, for eating ethnic food you know you are eating the real stuff if you're the only white person in the room. Try it out, and don't be afraid to eat with your hands."
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,22-Mar-15,This place has definitely changed my perception of restaurants at Little India. Was pleasantly surprise to find the food here good and tasty. Do try the mutton briyani and the every-simple teh tarik. Recommended!
Komala Vilas Restaurant,4.1,76,"Indian, Vegetarian",4,16-Aug-14,Delicious lunch sets. The waiters continuously top up the plate with additional rice and veggies.
The Royals Steakhouse,4.5,2,"Halal, Steakhouses",4,4-Apr-18,I had a great experience at this restaurant. The menu is small but still has something for everyone. I had the ribeye steak cooked rare. I could choose from three different sauces and choose the black pepper sauce which was very tasty. I received my steak quickly with accompanying salad greens and mashed potatoes.  What could have made it better? The open grill area made the dining area slightly smokey.
The Royals Steakhouse,4.5,2,"Halal, Steakhouses",5,19-Jul-19,"Didn't know how to appreciate steak, until 2 years ago.  I had medium rare. This steak actually made me forgot that I had sauce for my first few mouthful. It was juicy and tender. The pumpkin was good, but I felt kinda full as it tasted very filling.  Can't say anything about consistency as it's my first time going but I will definitely check back again."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,10-Apr-24,"One of the newer food halls that recently went under renovations in 2023. Looks very clean and modern looking compared to the other hawker centers in Singapore. Conveniently located by Gardens By The Bay near the Metro stop, makes this a nice pit stop for food before continuing on your site seeing adventure.  Stall 26 - Marina Bar & Bistro If you want a nice cold beer, this is the stall to get it.  Stall 9 - Makan by the Bay Ordered the Seafood Hor Fun Goreng (SG$8). This is a flat noodle dish with egg gravy on top, although the photos don't depict it with the egg gravy. Overall it was good.  Stall C1 - City Satay Skewers galore. Got the satay combo set A (SG$19) which came with 12 satay, 2 prawn, 2 pork belly, and 1 rice. For the satay, you can only choose 3 different kinds as the minimum for one is 4. You can choose between pork, chicken, mutton, beef, and otah. The best ones was mutton. The person taking the order was a bit rude."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,15-Sep-23,"Hawker center inside Gardens by the Bay. There are few stalls that offer different food and drinks. The options may be limited but decent enough. Prices were reasonable. Portion sizes were on the smaller side but it was a great to try different things.  My family and I ordered different dishes that filled the table. There were 4 of us. Most food was just ok but we did manage to finish everything. The crab dish was based on market price so that was the most expensive dish. Overall, it was a good meal."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",5,10-May-24,"After walking around Gardens by the Bay, my brother and I wanted to visit a hawker centre to pick up some lunch. We planned on taking the MRT to Chinatown but decided last minute to try Satay by the Bay. It's a very clean hawker centre with lots of options. We settled on the 20 satay combo (half chicken, half beef) from Geylang Serai Satay and Carrot Cake from Stall 18. Everything was delicious and quite reasonably priced. It's definitely a bit more than other hawker centres, but nothing crazy. This is a great stop for lunch when visiting Gardens by the Bay!"
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",3,4-Jan-23,"One of the few spots to eat when you search restaurants in Garden by the Bay, my partner and I came here between touring the domes. There are many different hawker stalls here and benches, though many were closed around 11am, when we were there.  We settled on City Satay where it was about $12 USD for 10 meat skewers and 2 shrimp skewers. The chicken was very tasty especially b/c we were so hungry having walked the Gardens by the Bay, though definitely overpriced for Singapore and compared to what you can get north of Gardens. The satay sauce though was great, but then again I am a sucker for peanut sauce...I also would have liked if we could mix and match, but the folks there said I couldn't, so I just went with chicken.  Despite the limited selection, the convenience and comparable prices to fancier restaurants in the area make it a great stop to go to when you're around Gardens by the Bay!"
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",5,22-Nov-23,This is a fun and casual location. Great for lunch or dinner. Several food stalls with different options to choose from. The is an outdoor location that is covered. The service is efficient and the employees are helpful if you can't decide what to get. Love coming here when we are in the area!
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,10-Mar-24,"There are so many of them. You picked the best one or go with the price. A $20 SGD will get you a lot of sticks in different type of meat. I saw family just to come here to have full meal with over 100+ sticks. Make sure you get a cold beer to o with the satay. You can sit anywhere (I perfect inside with fan) and secure you spot before it get crowded. It was a great idea to visit Garden by the bay earlier to enjoy this meal. The location is roomy and easy to find. If you take a MRT (TE line), and you will run into this place before the main buildings. They accept both cash and card."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,25-Oct-23,Excellent variety and high quality Hawker Center. Satay is wonderful. Many other extraordinary specialties!
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,11-Feb-23,"After a tip from our Grab driver, we went to Satay at the Bay for a quick dinner before enjoying the Garden by the Bay evening.  The satay skewers with peanut sauce were just right. Chicken and pork belly were full of flavor. All were very good.  Only one establishment served beer - which was fine. All cold.  We arrived around 5:30 and it was fairly empty. By 7:00, you could not find a table.  Fun place to be a little adventurous."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",3,31-Jul-22,"Mmm...I have mixed feelings about the hawker stands offered at this pavilion. The prices are pretty reasonable especially considering you're at Gardens by the Bay, but I didn't quite find what I was looking for despite all the selection.  We wound up getting a plate of fried rice which was good- not great, but fine, but what I really wanted was a refreshing smoothie. There was definitely a lack of adequate beverage selections at this pavilion, and I did find a place that had a guava smoothie. It was like sludge and the most unappetizing smoothie I've ever had. I don't know what other ingredients were in it, but I begrudgingly drank it because I was that desperate for something that would go down easy. I will never forget this awful smoothie. I still cannot believe I drank it all. I kept thinking I could get used to the taste, but I never did.  Because there is so much I didn't get around to trying, I figure there are better dishes around the pavilion, but we eventually went to another venue about an hour and a half later to get different food to make up for what lacked in this visit."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,12-Aug-19,"A very nice hawker near Gardens By The Bay that's a good option if your food cravings are hitting hard!  Decent amount of options for food and I did notice that they do have a lot of seafood options on top of all the typical hawker food. But since it is called ""Satay By The Bay"" you have to try the satay!  City Satay is one of the first stalls you'll see and smell and you can't go wrong with this one. Cheap and great quality satays! The menu shows various set options and a set of 20 is perfect for two people to share. Do note you can mix and match your meat options. I recommend their chicken satay: flavorful, very tender, grilled to perfection, and goes very well with their sauce!  Serving sizes are a tad small but the flavor of the satay and the quantity makes that irrelevant. They do provide a lot of the yummy sauce, always a plus!  Overall, a convenient location for a hawker with good options. A must-visit if you're craving satay!"
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,21-May-18,"We ate dinner here prior to seeing the light show at the Super Grove trees. As the name implies, this hawker center sells satay. But, it also sells other items such like seafood and drinks. Please bring mosquito repellent here, or you will certainly be eaten alive. Thank goodness we were prepared.  Anyway, back to the satay. Here, there are two main satay food stalls competing for customers. Of course we tried both stalls to see which one we liked. Now, we didn't get the names of these stalls. But, we know for certain that we enjoyed the satay stall further away from the dining tables. We tried both beef and mutton satays. However, we enjoyed the mutton satays best. They were more flavorful and aromatic than the beef satays. Also, the peanut sauce from the further away satay stall tasted better too. We were pretty hungry, and we ate God only knows how many satay sticks. It was really hard to stop. Lol.  Come here and check them out. Sample both satay food stalls and see which one you prefer. Enjoy!"
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",3,19-Jul-20,"Although definitely more expensive than regular hawker centers, this is a good option for a meal when you are out exploring Gardens by the Bay. I got a satay combo with delicious peanut sauce that filled me up on a super hot and tiring day. Lots of fresh air since it's outdoors but covered for the rain. I'd only recommend going for the location since there are much better hawkers around Singapore."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,10-Sep-17,"For my birthday in Singapore some friends an family decided on going to the Satay Club aka Satay By The Bay. All of us (party of 8) met up at about 7:30 pm and it was incredibly busy as it was a Saturday night. Recommend taking a cab or uber as parking was limited.  After navigating the crowd, my god sister ordered a whole bunch of food which included sambal kangkong, crispy fried baby squid, steam cockles, chili crab, lots of satay and saut¨¦ed bok choy. Damn it was all good. Service was a little slow as it was a busy night. I recommend first timers to ask the servers how to eat some of the dishes if you are not sure.  After dinner we moved to the desert stall where everyone picked their own desert. I had an iced jelly with lunch longan and canned fruit. It was good but a little too sweet.  When dinner lasts 3 hours, you know it was a good time had by all."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",3,1-Jun-18,"This place is located near the Marina Bay Gardens and I ended up eating here a couple times. The place is much livelier at night as during the day it was pretty empty and hard to flag down the people who run each of the stalls.  At night there is a man and woman yelling ""satay satay satay"" for the satay stall and I ended up getting the satay from there. Be aware that there is quite a wait for them to actually finish making the satay, as they grill it as you order it, so if you're in a rush I wouldn't recommend this place.  The satay itself ended up being just average. I've had much better satay elsewhere, and the sauce was just so-so. It tastes like if you just ordered satay from a restaurant that specializes in something else, where the main focus isn't the satay. Still the dish was cooked fresh and I guess I can't complain.  I also had the hokkien mee (noodles and shrimp) from another stall, and that was pretty bad I wouldn't recommend that.  Overall a good selection of food, but none of it looked or tasted that great."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,10-Mar-19,"With so many food courts and hawker stalls in Singapore, it's not surprising that there's one in the Garden by the Bay. While Satay By The Bay is not the best or biggest food court, it still offers some terrific good eats.  I came here late Saturday morning. Most of the stalls did not open until 11:30 am. After reading some other yelp reviews, I tried the BBQ Wings stall and ordered the three wing combo. The wings are perfectly grilled over open charcoal. The chicken meat literally fell off the bones. The jasmine rice was moist, fragrant, and complemented the wings. Following the wings, I tried an egg and onion briyani from the briyani stand. The breading was good - soft, fluffy and the onion added a kick to the light flavoring. If you are an egg lover - like me - the briyani probably could have used two eggs to give it a bit more omelette/egg flavor.  Satay By The Bay has lots of other foodie options, including fresh seafood offerings. There are lots of Chinese cuisine stalls (e.g dumplings, stir fry, and noodles) and most definitely several satay stalls - hence the name Satay By The Bay. There is also a full bar and juice bar that also offers fresh cut fruit.  Lastly, Satay By the Bay has a nice garden surrounding, and is worth visiting if you don't want McD while you are at the Garden By The Bay."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",3,30-Sep-19,"Ambience Super Smokey, good location cause it's near all the touristy stuff. Variety of stores and many tables.  Food A lot pricier than other Hawker places. Kabobs we got were pretty small and it felt like we didn't even eat much at all lol. $10 for 15 small kabobs!"
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,11-Feb-19,"There are many food stalls to choose from so this a good place to go when you get hungry. They have really good satay but the people working there have a bit of an attitude. My husband and I were try to choose which Satay stall to order from and just because we were taking awhile, the workers from both satay stalls were giving us dirty looks. It's not our fault that they both were right next to each other. Another stall that tried was Huat Huat BBQ chicken wings and that was one the best meals that we had that day, the chicken was really good and the staff was friendly as well."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,5-Apr-17,"We came to try the satay since we were in the area, the place felt like an outdoor food court with bright flashing lights that seemed to be vying for your undivided attention. Since it was open air foodcourt,it was humid and very little breeze to comfort you. WE decided on the first satay shop we saw where the lady was waving a laminated menu in front of us.The combo of assorted satay/ BBQ were very tasty."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,25-Feb-19,I was surprised by the negative reviews. A guess there was a lot of close minded travelers. We went to a satay place that was super friendly and very reasonably priced.  The other food stands had a variety of options and I was pleasantly surprised at the value. Everything looked very clean. I was kind of saddened that the weather was so crappy because I think a lot of the vendors stayed home. Half of the little shops were not open when we went.
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,28-Jan-16,"Satay by the Bay was our first Food Hawker experience in Singapore. It was a fun and yummy adventure. We had 16 people in our group. Each went to explore their own food stalls so we were able to share and sample much variety of food.  Chili Crab - It was messy, and spicy. Take your time and eat with rice. Fish head stew- It does not sound so good but there is a lot of meat surrounding the head. Fried fish cakes - pick out the stuff you want then they deep fried them upon ordering. Popiah spring roll - super thin crepe wrapped crunchy vegetables like carrots, peanuts, jicama, turnip, bean curd. The bomb if you like veggies. Chicken wings - juicy on the inside, crispy on the outside, it was good but not mind blowing. Satay sticks - honestly, the different meats all tasted about the same to me since they have the same sauce. Cane juice and coconut juice- fresh from the source, happy face!  They have open sink with soap for people to wash hand."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",5,6-Dec-19,"I walk ALL OVER Singapore trying to find this place and i don't regret a single minute of it. This was the ultimate hawker stand food. For about 50usd/each my friend and I ate like kings. It was my first time eating bbq stingray and it was....interesting. The place is really hidden away so its a bit of a hike to get it but you won't regret a single minute of it. Get the soft shell crab too, its one of the best things they have. Also you have to get the beer, can't eat Spivey hawker food without beer."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,7-Mar-18,"Lots of satay places to choose from plus some other foods as well. We just shared some satay. We had beef, chicken, pork and shrimp. All were tasty and it came with a peanut sauce which was tasty. We also had some tiger beer here as well. Prices are going to be a bit more expensive since you're near gardens by the bay but it was still good. I would recommend a stop here."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",3,2-Mar-17,"Not the most authentic of hawker centers in Singapore, Satay by the Bay aims to give those visiting Gardens by the Bay a taste of the traditional fare in a slightly more elegant outdoor setting.  It's clean, of course, with the standard hygiene ratings prominently displayed in each stall. And there's variety, from Indian to Malay to Turkish to Chinese to Singapore satay. The six of us ordered a handful of dishes from different stalls to share: roti prata and mee goreng; chicken, lamb and beef satay with spicy peanut sauce and cucumbers (it's a must); fried rice and sweet barbecued baby squid (this one was interesting. They were as crispy as freshly minted potato chips); chicken wings and black pepper beef; and honeydew and watermelon juice from the drinks stall.  The flavors were all there and it was a great introduction to the variety of tastes that Singapore has to offer for my friend, a first-time visitor, but I probably wouldn't go back. I've had better dishes elsewhere in the city (even at touristy places such as Lau Pa Sat). That said, the seafood mee goreng, a long-time favorite of mine, was delicious.  The bathrooms are outdoors and clean, too. Perfect for washing the satay sauce off your hands before taking a stroll about the marina."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",5,16-Nov-19,"If you go to Singapore and really want authentic food head to Satay by the Bay!!!!! Right next to the famous super tree grove and marina bay sands, Satay by the bay is like a higher end hawker centre that serves delicious, flavourful Singaporean food!!!!! There are multiple stalls that serve various different types of foods!!!! You definitely need to try the satay there!!!! The satay there is so so delicious and the sauce goes so well with the chicken, pork, beef and shrimp skewers!!!! You also need to try the barbecue chicken wings which are so smoky and full of flavour!!!! You can even try unique foods, like stingray and the hundred year old eggs, or classic Singaporean desserts or juices, such as chendol or Bandung!!!! You definitely need to visit this place!!!!! You can even do some sightseeing while you are there!!!!"
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,7-Dec-15,"Smokey Goodness by the Bay  Satay by the Bay, one of our favorite places to dine in Singapore. Not just a modern food court, Satay by the Bay brings back some of the old charm of the old Satay Club. Maybe it's the outdoor setting with its wooden stools and low tables or Maybe it's the hint of salt water coming from the reservoir. Which ever it is, it's certainly made Satay by the Bay one of our favourite food joints.  While we've yet to try everything here, there are some notable stalls we would and wouldn't recommend.  Sri Geylang Sate Definitely our favourite stall of the 6 (or 8?) stalls available here. I suppose Satay is quite selective. We love this store because the meats are well marinated and very fragrant. The chicken is is juicy, mutton too. Beef, a little of the dry side but still very very tasty.  City Satay is probably the most popular of the Chinese owned satay stalls. Maybe it's the variety or the fact that they're a well know brand but personally, I feel that he sauce is a little synthetic and factory made.  Boon Tat Barbecue Seafood Definitely our favourite Tze Char stall here. They have a good variety of dishes but we personally enjoy the BBQ stingray here. Unlike other BBQ stingrays, the chilli used here is more dry Belachan than it is Sambal. It's salty, flavorful and goes very well with the stingray.  Another favourite is their Special Fried Chicken wings. Refusing to say what the marinade or batter really is, there is a hint of fermented prawn past. The chicken is nice and crispy and very juicy (except for our last visit where it was a little over cooked). Maybe they aren't used to the crowds thanks to Gardens by the Bay's Christmas Carnival.  Another notable mention is Wholly Crab. Opened by local celebrity Felicia Chin, the crab in a bag looks absolutely delightful. Though we haven't tried it personally, the number of people happily digging in and licking their fingers is enough to get my attention and we're going to try it next time!  Overall, we love this place. Is it touristy? A little but there's enough good food here to keep the locals coming back. Some items may be on the slightly pricier side as compared to our regular food court or food centre stalls but, it's still worth the walk and definitely worth the price.  Satay Party anyone?"
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",5,13-Sep-19,Best place to eat satay satay. Smokey surrounding but that belongs to this kind of foodspot. Cheap cheap but great taste and Flip flop comfortable atmosphere.
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",5,15-Dec-15,"BEST satay in Singapore according to my relatives and.. yes it was indeed good.  A short walk from Gardens by the Bay this place is filled with wonderful and delicious satay and other typical Singaporean foods. It's a great place to unwind after seeing all of the attractions around MBS.  Yes, it's filled with tourist but what do you expect being so close to Gardens by the Bay? This shouldn't deter you from coming and trying the most wonderful satay ever though."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,28-May-18,"This is an OK place by Gardens by the bay for a quick bite to eat. Satay, chili crab, stingray, Indian food, and even some eastern Mediterranean food, there is a good variety here, however it is a little overpriced."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,19-Jul-18,"The place has loads of variety, and very tasty food that can appeal to any taste or dietary requirement. It has more than just satay, there's crabs, lobsters, chicken, rice, pot food, Turkish food and pretty much anything. The satay is nutty and spicy, and the chicken is slightly tough, but delicious, and the chips from the Mariana Bar were crunchy and tasty. Service is a bit slow, but it's a good place to eat if you're willing to wait."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",3,10-Jun-17,City Satay - 1 star Mutton and beef satay ($0.70 per stick) Too fatty and I couldn't even tell the difference between the mutton and the beef. The sticky rice (ketupat) was also soggy. They also advertised their pineapple sauce but said it wasn't ready... it's the nearest stall so it was popular but not worth it!  Seems like there's a stall with blue plates that looks good.  Popiah ($2.50) - 2 stars A bit tasteless.  Coconut ($4) - 4 stars Sweet with some soft flesh.
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",5,28-Oct-17,"Best satay in town. Grilled on charcoal - fresh and tasty. Great place to enjoy a wonderful evening. Choose your favourite meat . Beef, chicken, goat or something else. Up to you!"
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",3,21-Jan-13,"Lots of potential if the place really opens up and get the right publicity and good food.  Right now, there is only two satay stalls, one BBQ seafood stall, one BBQ chicken wings and the drinks stall. There are signs on the other empty stalls on opening dates.  The chicken wings were great. Crispy skin, nicely seasoned. The satays were a little too sweet for my liking, the BBQ stingray were so-so. Pricing were a little high (wings go for $1.40 each), guess that is partly for the location.  It is located right between Gardens by the Bay and the barrage. They actually have their own car park that gets you right to the doorsteps. But we realized later that the barrage is just a nice walk away along the reservoir, and free parking!"
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",5,7-Oct-16,"The Marina Bay Sands/Gardens by the Area area is fairly expensive food-wise. However, Satay by the Bay and the food center area around it is probably your most affordable area. There's plenty of selection and the food that I had (except for the American fare) looks, smells and tastes pretty good.  It's all under-cover outdoor seating with fans dispersed evenly around the eating area. Be wary of random bird droppings as birds do fly through here freely.  Compared to other food centers or or food courts, this place is a dollar or so more expensive, but it will be your cheapest option on a day or evening at Gardens by the Bay."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,7-Feb-19,"Black & White Delight We ordered bbq sotong and bbq baby octopus from this stall. Omg, it was so good. I will definitely come back again for more!"
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,19-Nov-18,Hawker center near the Gardens by The Bay. Several Satay stalls. But decided on some pratas. Plain & Sandine with curry dip. Both were delicious. Don't forget to get some chendol & ais kachang on the stall right around the corner from Indian food.
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",5,9-Sep-16,"Did you know you can eat stingray?! I didn't but once I saw you could I had to try it. It was delicious but be careful about bones. The satay was as good as grilled meat can be..which of course is amazing. Multiple stalls to choose from. My impression which could be wrong is that I was getting some street food without the street food risk because it was at the back of gardens by the bay. It was a mix of locals and tourists which also seems like a positive sign. The people were very friendly and the whole area was very clean overall. If you're at gardens of the bat and don't require 5 star ambiance you have to go eat some meat on a stick, at the very least."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,2-Nov-15,"It's a touristy place, sure, but not a bad way to get your satay fix. There are two rows of satay stalls - the Malay vendors & Chinese vendors. Get satay from both!  On the Malay side, Satay Power is very good. They have a very thick style peanut sauce, tasty and quite power. Chicken wings are super yummy! And best of all, good service and very nice staff.  On the Chinese side, you can get... pork belly satay! City Satay did the job though I wasn't a fan of their weaker and more watery peanut sauce."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",5,6-Jan-18,"Had satay and tried two different satay stalls; 1) Black and White 2) Sri Geylang. We like the Black and White better, the satay is not so sweet and the meat is not so fatty. Black and white has BBQ Mushroom which turned out to be very good too. If you like to try Satay Mutton, my vote is for Black and White."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,19-Jul-13,"3 stars for its scenic location. 1 star for its average quality food. Tried their satay, fried beehoon, BBQ stingray, BBQ cuttlefish, and chicken wings.  The quality is so so and kind of pricey. It is not crowded on weekday.  For those who don't drive, there is a free shuttle that loops from marina bay mrt to garden by the bay and then into satay by the bay.  As this place is still new, many locals including cab drivers do not know its existence. It is located in between garden by the bay and marina barrage. It is hidden behind a parking lots"
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,15-Dec-14,"This place is pretty cool.  Walking from the Gardens and financial district along the river, Satay by the Bay pops up from seemingly nowhere.  Its hot. Its crowded. Its smokey because satay and outside.  But oh man, its delicious. and cheap. Try the first stall on the left hand side; we ordered shrimp, beef and chicken. You can buy a la carte or by 'groupings'. We also had chili crab, soups and young coconut juice. All that food, stuffed to the gils, for about 50 SG$ for 3 hungry ladies.  The next time I'm in Singapore, I'll go back for sure :)"
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,9-Nov-14,"Looking for satay for lunch as my hubby will be flying off back to Hong Kong tonight....no luck at China Town Food Street nor Lau Pa Sat....Whatsapp for rescue and a friend suggested Satay by the Bay...And this is the place to go! Bonfire satay at a food court by the river, how nice! The sugar cane juice is a freshly squeezed one which goes well with the satay! Nice nice!"
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,4-Jul-17,Fun place to go if you are in the area. We went to Sir Geylang Sate and it was pretty good. Wish the amount of meat was larger but what do you want to for .55 (USD) per stick? Just order more! This place also had a fresh fruit stall which was great since the night was hot and balmy.
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",4,8-Dec-14,"Another yelper described Satay by the Bay as sad....and sadly, it's totally true. We came here after visiting Gardens by the Bay and we were one of only a handful of groups in the entire hawker area. That said, it was fun sitting outside at the low tables, and satay were awesomely good. Just as tasty as anywhere else I'd had, with good variety, and the vendors were eager to serve us. Nice views of the bay as well...it's unfortunate the place doesn't seem to do much business."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",1,14-Jan-14,"This food court is the saddest food court I have ever come across in my 15 years in Singapore. The standards are...(wait there are none), sadly to say I'm getting frustrated just writing this post and thinking about the place.  My family and I decided to go because there was some write up about it on the ST today, and to think that Tony Bourdain wants to bring this concept to Manhattan? Sure, just as long as its not a replica of it. The one thing I can never get with Singapore and its developments are that they are always half-assing things. If you've been there and seen the sad satay stalls perched on the exterior i think you know what I'm talking about. They are not even created as permanent stalls, but makeshifts, as if there was some food show and they just came to set up. This is your namesake for crying out loud!  It's a shame... a total shame. Not to mention that only a handful of stalls were open and the options were bbq seafood, bbq seafood, 5 satay stalls, one turkish place and steamboat. Food was...let's just say I would have been a lot happier grabbing a mickey d's takeout. We ordered a chicken kebab, (bland) bread was good though, hommous was one-note, baba ghanoush went sour. We tried the bbq seafood (next to the popiah stall) everything tasted the same...and sadly they cook just to cook, no thought in to it, just as long as it was edible.  I don't know what to say GBTB, clean up your act a little, you spent so much money on your gardens and you place this eye-sore in the corner...of which your little wooden plank signage was horrible at directing us.  Will I ever come back? I think the answer is clear. That is unless they bring in better stalls, and spiff up the place."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",3,22-Jul-13,I think most of the food not really nice.. BBQ service super poor.. Ordered a stingray n was extreme not fresh at all.. Must try bbq chicken from the Muslim satay stall next to geylang seri 10x much better then huat huat !! Indian food is good as well . Tried the crayfish porridge from the seafood soup stall and didn't expect that it turn out super tasty.. Never had it anywhere else like that...Must try or regret ..!! My friend ordered prawn mee.. Gosh .. It's so so normal..
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",1,5-Dec-16,Beware of the fruit stall. Ordered a stick on papaya and staff gave me 1/2. When confronted staff said it wasn't fresh and walked away with it!
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",1,10-Dec-17,Thought it would be a great hub to get assortment of great grilled meat! And variety of street food options! I made a mistake of choosing city satay and food was not only horrible but it was also undercooked! Meat was stale! Food was not even edible! If you are a tourist please do not go here! Save your time and eat somewhere else!!
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",5,24-Mar-18,"right beside the marina barrage, great view. the food there are top notch local delicacies. first time there and looking to go back again soon"
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",1,17-Nov-13,"Been there but let me just say disappointing. Satay is expensive. Drinks is expensive and scarce. Long line for drinks and Served by grumpy aunties. Other than a good location, food is rated so so. For tourists only."
Satay By The Bay,3.7,52,"Seafood, Barbeque",1,30-Mar-13,Tried this place last night. Most of the stuff are over priced. Fruit juice at $4! Satay at 80¡é a piece. Coke at $3 per can. Did not try the BBQ seafood but I expect it to be expensive. I felt like I paid just to rent a place to sit for 40 mins. Everything is a long wait 25-30 minutes. Bad expensive experience.
Public House,4.5,2,"Bars, Singaporean",5,23-Oct-15,"Popular for a reason, and whilst it is a bit of a home from home, the staff make it a nice relaxing fun place for a few drinks with friends.  Can get a bit busy at the weekends, but if you want the pool table get in early!!  Price wise this is where it wins out, despite being in one of the busiest areas right next to the financial district it still manages to keep things reasonable.  We managed to get some food one night as well, just as the kitchen was closing so we were very grateful they rustled us up some chicken wings, onion rings and chips - all of which hit the mark with some Tiger beers!"
Public House,4.5,2,"Bars, Singaporean",4,28-Sep-14,A popular hangout on weeknights for business people working at the nearby financial district. A british themed bar.
Violet Oon Satay & Grill,4,10,"Seafood, Singaporean",1,19-Nov-19,"Not authentic PERANAKAN food ! So noisy with loud music and dark .... The worst are the TOILETS which are quite far away and NOT CLEAN ! PUBLIC TOILET ! The service is SO SO , so many empty tables and we are tucked in small corner for two :/:SATAYS are too sweet ! BEEF RENDANG is under average . DO NOT RECOMMEND this place !"
Violet Oon Satay & Grill,4,10,"Seafood, Singaporean",4,23-May-17,"Cheers to April as April is always Fabulous with food. I have heard of Violet Oon's Peranakan Food and always wanted to try thus wish was granted. However instead of going to the one located in Bukit Timah, we went to their latest restaurant located in Clarke Quay.  I was not surprise of its interior as it was kind of along the line where a Bar's ambiance will be liked. However it still have a good feel of Peranakan Style (old school) amongst those modern furnishing, decking out in dark woods and authentic Peranakan tiles. Overall the place reminds me of their rich culture but with a revamp into today's settings.  If you are hankering for Violet Oon's Peranankan Cuisine like me, fret not. Even though this is a bar and grill, they do incorporate many popular dishes like Ayam Buah Keluah, Kueh Pie Tee, Ngoh Hiang etc.  Suitable for vegetarian, these Fried Bean Curds were served with julienned cucumber and fresh beansprouts. Bean Curds were sliced and topped with very yummy Violet's Signature sweet and tangy peanut sauce. A perfect go to start your meal if you are looking for some appetizers.  Tau Hu Goreng - $9  One of the best Ngoh Hiang i ever had for it was not oily and these Ngoh Hiang tastes refreshing with the crispy deep fried bean curd skin cradling ingredients like prawn, crab and minced chicken with water chestnut seasoning as well as five spice powder. Dipped this fried Ngoh Hiang into the given sweet sauce or Sambal Belachan. It also goes well with the seasoned sides - Achar.  Ngoh Hiang - $15  When it comes to Nonya Food, this is the classic. Spicy and tangy chicken stew with a few Buah Keluak nuts infused with fresh root spices of Lengkuas and Tumeric. I like that the Chicken meat was tender with generous serving of Buah Keluak however it still lacked the good taste that i find on the meat. Could it be the strong tumeric soury taste had overtaken the authentic taste?  Buah Keluak Ayam - $23  With a variety of Satay to choose from, each type of meat comes in a plate of 3. We had the large chicken chunks marinated in spices, grilled and served with thick flavour pack spicy peanut toasted sauce topped with freshly grated pineapple, steam rice cake, cucumber and red onion. Recommended!  Chicken Satay - $14  You cant miss out this classic dish from the menu! I would say the all time favourite to order. This festive dish of braised mixed vegetables and bean curd skin in a rich prawn bisque is really awesome, love the part where the mushrooms were so juicy and plump. It may seems a bit oily but best of all its not cloying at all.  Chap Chye - $15  Choose between Nasi Lemak Rice and Jasmine Rice. The Nasi Lemak Rice is served elegantly in a small little white pot, packed with alluring fragrance of the coconut milk.  Nasi Lemak Rice - $2  Loving the sweet ending to our meal with a scoop of Gula Melaka and coconut ice cream drenched with Gula Melaka syrup. What makes the good experience will be the toasted cashew nuts toppings.  VO's Ice Cream with Cashew Crunch - $10  Overall, I find that it is a good place for gathering as well as chill out. The ambiance makes alot of difference and you will never feel as if like you are visiting the usual traditional Peranakan Place."
Violet Oon Satay & Grill,4,10,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,24-Nov-18,"Went for afternoon tea after spending the day at the museum. Great atmosphere, service, and food. The local version Peranakan afternoon tea is great. Very nice savory and sweet foods make for an authentic taste experience. Highly recommend if you're looking for a more interesting afternoon tea."
Violet Oon Satay & Grill,4,10,"Seafood, Singaporean",4,17-Nov-18,"Semi-upscale Singaporean food. As the name suggests, the satay here is really good - juicy tender meat - you can't go wrong with any selection - chicken, pork, beef, shrimp  Besides the satay we also tried the Mee Siam, which was a tad bit spicy, and the Barramundi, which was well cooked/seasoned though perhaps  Good desserts and cocktail selection as well. A good place to bring out of town guests for local food in a nicer setting"
Violet Oon Satay & Grill,4,10,"Seafood, Singaporean",3,23-Jul-17,A very fancy Nyonya Type of restaurant. Food here is ok. A very good place to bring your guests here.
Violet Oon Satay & Grill,4,10,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,1-Aug-19,Wonderful satay and fried rice. Wow. Amazing food and excellent service in a really cool environment! Great job guys!
Violet Oon Satay & Grill,4,10,"Seafood, Singaporean",4,14-Jul-18,"Good clean place to meet up with 'food nervous' expat friends. Plenty of staff ensures service, service, service. The food is well plated with many delicious options - it's a safe place to explore seasonings and spice. Very handsome decor. Do it."
Violet Oon Satay & Grill,4,10,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,17-Oct-17,"This was one of our favorite meals in Singapore. The chicken satay and sauce were great-sweet heat. We also had the beef dish and mixed vegetables in coconut broth. The side order of jasmine rice was just enough. The setting in Clarke Quay is great too-we did riverboat cruise after this fine meal, so the location worked out well too."
Violet Oon Satay & Grill,4,10,"Seafood, Singaporean",4,7-May-17,"Some items were good, others were meh. Recommended: Tumeric Sotong, Beef Satay, Beef Rendang. Avoid: Mee Siam - they use pasta instead of bee hoon - what?. Meh: Chap Chye - looks and tastes home cooked."
Violet Oon Satay & Grill,4,10,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,10-Sep-17,This is a great option to bring out of town guests and visitors who want local flavors in a beautifully designed setting. The service was excellent and the food a nice balance between being refined and authentic.
Once Upon A Thyme,4.4,7,"Street Vendors, Italian",4,5-May-16,"A great pasta option if you're at the Novena MRT station. Turn left after the exit turnstiles and head into B1 of Square 2 Mall. The stall is simple yet whips out some nice aromas. Primarily a takeaway place, but there are some counter seating behind the stall.  The Spicy Meatball Tomato Cream was quite good. Handmade chicken meatballs and spaghetti in a tomato cream sauce with hint of spiciness. The meatballs were nice and tender with good flavor. Pasta was a bit overcooked to my liking.  Looking forward to trying the other menu items soon."
Once Upon A Thyme,4.4,7,"Street Vendors, Italian",4,2-Oct-18,"I've only ever eaten the fried fish aglio olio here, but I found it really great value for money. The shop is meant to be a takeaway place, but there's a bunch of seats directly behind it for customers.  Service was really quick, though I dislike that they take cash only. The pasta was delicious but a bit greasy. The fish was freshly fried upon order, and the portion of pasta is a bit small, but the fish makes up for it. Overall, a quick crowd-pleaser meal. Yum."
Once Upon A Thyme,4.4,7,"Street Vendors, Italian",5,11-Jun-16,"Once upon a thyme, a little (ok not so little) girl who was extremely hungry, roamed around in the mall & cant decide what to eat. Right at the basement, smack in the middle of all other shops, she saw this pasta takeaway shop with a long queue of human patiently waiting for their orders. Her eyes sparkled. Maybe this is good?! With her fastest fingers, check yelp first lah!  Wow. Good reviews on yelp! Must try!  The menu is categorised into aglio olio, tomato based and cream based pasta. Price range between $7 to $10. Very affordable lunch for workers in the area. There are some uncomfortable side seats where you face their busy work area & the table makes my legs awkward. I chose a seat at the corner so that i can sit sideway to enjoy my meal.  You order, pay, get your receipt with q nos and wait for your number to be called. The staff has a super bright smile and happily entertained my request of putting chili padi in my pasta. You have no idea how this made me so so so delighted. Haha. I love chilli padi in my cream pasta & had a runny nose for a week already. That chilli really made my day. He look very happy putting up my request & even ask cheekily: you want more cheese?! Hehe. Oh my.. Because of him, im giving another 1 star.  Ok here comes my pasta. The cream is so thick & very generous portion! With slices of chicken breast, edamame, tonnes of herbs & spags, this $7 of goodiness is the best food i had in the week. (Been eating plain food.. Zzz) I love it & will return again. Thank you for selling affordable good food in Singapore. -- New fan of OUAT (read how they start up in a coffeeshop on their website!)"
Once Upon A Thyme,4.4,7,"Street Vendors, Italian",5,29-Jan-15,"Top notch delicious pasta takeway spot at affordable prices located in Novena MRT (Square 2 basement). I've had different versions of their aglio olio and my favorite is the aglio olio with battered fish! For only $8, you can amazingly delicious aglio olio and 3 huge glorious chunks of battered fish.  Unfortunately it closes at 8pm or I'd buy even more dinners from here!"
Once Upon A Thyme,4.4,7,"Street Vendors, Italian",5,7-May-15,"Once upon a time....well, 2 days ago to be exact, I had the opportunity to try out the pasta at this vendor. My oh my, it was good. I had the penne funghi with cheese. The pasta was al dente and the sauce had the right consistency and taste. The portion was perfect, not too much or too little. The best part was the price, 5.80 sgd. I'll truly miss this place once I leave Singapore because it was one of the best pasta I've had in a long time. I would have gotten something for my long flight back to the U.S. if my flight wasn't so early. Cheap, quick, friendly, and great taste."
Once Upon A Thyme,4.4,7,"Street Vendors, Italian",4,10-Jun-16,"Tried a few times, like other reviewers said, with that price it is probably the best CP pasta stall in town. The sauce, the texture of the pasta and the variety, worth giving it a try."
Once Upon A Thyme,4.4,7,"Street Vendors, Italian",4,15-Jun-15,"Nice pasta place for take out. You order at the counter and wait for your number to be called to pick up your pasta. There is a limited menu with lots of pastas, some drinks and bread and soup. I enjoy the spicy aglio olio with sausage and mushrooms. My wife likes the turkey bacon carbonara. Be forewarned, there is no where nearby to sit."
Fatty Cheong @ Toa Payoh,5,2,"Meat Shops, Cantonese",5,2-Oct-16,Stumble upon this stall while looking for some food. It just opened n was not sure of the food. The older roast meat joint previously at this vicinity was sold off to another owner that was worse. That was last year.  I returned to this stall frequently and now the business is rolling. only recently I realized that it was related to the famous fatty cheong of Bukit Merah.  The char siew here is the best meat around. There was no extra fake red colouring. It is roasted to natural colours of the condiments. The meat was chop to thick slices with a generous amount covering the plate of freshly cooked fluffy white rice. The meat had some fat on it and unfortunately that was the best part! the fat and the caramelized roasting sauce combined into the most delicious concoction. The rice and char siew is covered with a nice thick roast sauce giving much flavour to the rice. unfortunately they were no greens.... cucumber etc on it.
Fatty Cheong @ Toa Payoh,5,2,"Meat Shops, Cantonese",5,1-Nov-21,"Great food! I think the wanton me was really nice, and environment was decent too. Would revisit again in the future."
Torasho Ramen & Charcoal Bar,4.5,4,"Bars, Ramen",5,11-Mar-20,"Loud, boisterous crowd, and super delicious food. Very lively atmosphere perfect for a night out.  We walked into Torasho Ramen and Charcoal Bar on a busy Friday night without any reservation but lucky us, we scored a table by the bar because someone didn't turn up! The restaurant has a chillax and lively vibe, with over-enthusiastic staff, great song playlist while the ever-efficient chef and sous-chefs working their magic in the open kitchen. The name of this restaurant is quite misleading - the restaurant does not focus entirely on ramen but also small and big plates for sharing.  We ordered Lobster dry ramen as ""starter"" followed by wagyu chips, grilled oysters, chicken wings karaage and ending the meal with a beautiful slab of 150gm Kagoshima beef. The wagyu chips are a show stopper, so simple yet so delicious. It's super addictive - potato chips fried in wagyu fats and drizzle with bits of truffle. Sounds amazing already! The dry lobster ramen is good to share, while the Kagoshima beef is so good. Get it done medium rare, so it's juicy and tender. Of all the dishes we ordered, the grilled oysters would probably be my least favourite, so I'll probably give it a pass next time.  Tras Street is already dotted with many interesting restaurants and Torasho is a great addition to the quieter part of Tanjung Pagar district. You can't miss the restaurant if you're coming from Chinatown, as it's the first restaurant you see on your right. To make it easier, it's opposite Six Senses Hotel Maxwell.  I highly recommend this restaurant for it's chill vibes where you can eat, talk and laugh without being tied to the etiquette of a fine dining restaurant. The affordable price point and great service already warrant a return visit for sure.  So, come one come all!"
Torasho Ramen & Charcoal Bar,4.5,4,"Bars, Ramen",4,18-Jun-22,Food all good except the short rib was a miss little on the dry side. Noodle was perfectly done with just enough spice. Service was ok.
Torasho Ramen & Charcoal Bar,4.5,4,"Bars, Ramen",5,31-Aug-20,"Came here on a recommendation of someone who mentioned the Tsukemen here is one of the best in Singapore (perhaps a close match to the famed Fuunji in Tokyo). While Fuunji still remains number one to me, Torasho does serve a mean Tsukemen that is yummy and affordable, and I'd definitely return for my ramen cravings.  They also have Wagyu Chips which are SO good -- thinly sliced potatoes fried in beef fat and topped with truffle. Y u m.  The space is small and cozy, and they don't take walk-ins so be sure to make reservations ahead of time! Ambience is great for dates or with a group of friends.  Cashless payments only. Limited street parking available (alternatively a really short walk from Tanjong Pagar MRT)  Can't dine in? They sell DIY ramen packs as well!"
Torasho Ramen & Charcoal Bar,4.5,4,"Bars, Ramen",4,19-Mar-21,"Torasho is a modern izakaya, serving up some interesting fusion food along with Japanese classics. We tried the Tsukumen (dipping ramen) where the cold noodles are served separately from the hot broth. Was super delicious. We also tried the pork taco - surprisingly good, the gyoza - also nice and the chicken karage - too oily for our liking. Washed these down with some nice chilled beer. Special shout out to the lime basque cheesecake - was better than some spanish places we have tried!!"
Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,4.6,15,Chinese,5,19-Feb-23,"Cheong Fun back in the States has always been a hit or miss for me. Either the rice paper is too thick or there just isn't much substance in the rolls. This hawker stall looked promising and you just can't really beat the price.  And just as expected, this stall had one of the longer lines at the hawker center. Everyone else had the same idea and was starting their day off with an order of cheong fun. It was pretty cool watching them prep everything, I don't think I've ever seen how it's made. Everything looked so fresh and the workers were so efficient in pushing out orders.  We ordered the shrimp (classic option), char siew, and scallops to try. Out of all three, the shrimp was the best but the pieces could've been bigger. But the nice thing about smaller fillings was that we could focus more on the rice paper, which really stood out. It was so thin and silky smooth, nothing like back home! The scallops used were also really small pieces and I thought shrimp was good enough if you're craving seafood.  For the sauce, they drown your plate and add a dollop of chili sauce on the side. You don't have to worry about cheong fun to sauce ratio here!"
Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,4.6,15,Chinese,5,12-Jan-23,"Cheong fun has been my absolute favorite dim sum dish ever since childhood, so I was excited to come try this place out! I've never seen the dish actually being made, so it was cool to see how each piece is made, from the batter being steamed, the meats placed inside, then being carefully rolled and chopped. Each plate is made to order on the flat metal work surfaces they have set up, so you might be waiting for a while in line if there are a lot of people in front of you. But I think it was well worth the wait!  I stuck with my trusty prawn order and it did not disappoint. The rolls were so silky that they were a bit difficult to pick up, but once I managed to do so they melted in my mouth! Highly recommend any cheong fun fans to stop by, and will definitely return if I'm ever back in Singapore."
Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,4.6,15,Chinese,5,15-Sep-23,Found this place on Yelp. 20 minute walk from my hotel. Worth it! The cheong fun with char siu did not disappoint! And this little market is worth it.
Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,4.6,15,Chinese,5,13-Jan-23,"The highlight of this hawker center was Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun! Watching them make it fresh, by order was amazing!  They are so efficient - one person is taking the orders and doing the packaging/plating, one is taking the unsteamed rolls and placing them into the steamer and arranging it onto the final surface, and the last is oiling the last surface and rolling and cutting each roll perfectly.  They ask if you want chili - definitely get it! It only adds to the experience even more. The cheong fun itself was so silky and so soft! I do think they could give more filling, but honestly you can't beat the price! This price beats any Dim Sum restaurant in the states nowadays.  If there's one stall you have to visit, it's definitely this one."
Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,4.6,15,Chinese,1,14-Feb-24,I was there on the supposed opening hours and this place was closed. There's no signs posted. maybe it's out of business. What a disappointment
Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,4.6,15,Chinese,5,5-Nov-23,One of the best dishes that I had while in Singapore. Really loved the dish and atmosphere. Went in the AM for breakfast and would not have it any other way.
Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,4.6,15,Chinese,4,14-Apr-19,"They make it all fresh but only two at a time. So if some person orders 20-30 portions for take away, then expect wait +1 hour, which unfortunately happen to me. I would estimate only a 20-30min wait in line if the people in front of you only order portions for their own dining. The actual ³¦·Û is very good and you can tastes the different from what you get in restaurants. The shrimp is also very fresh and excellent texture. Combine these with the sauces and you have a five star dish. But with the +1 hour wait standing in line, i'd deduct one star for the total experience. If the wait would have been 20-30min instead, i would have rated 4.5 stars for the total experience."
Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,4.6,15,Chinese,5,23-Nov-19,"With all of the great markets and restaurants in Singapore, you would think I wouldn't come back to a Hong Kong Style Noodle Shop? You thought wrong dude! This place is bomb. A family runs the shop and make your noodles fresh to order. It was a 15 minute walk from my Hotel and was more excited to come back each time. If you like Pork, the Char Siew is unbeatable. The Cheong Fun and Prawns were also exceptional. The thing that makes this place so special, the noodles MELT on your tongue before you even get the chance to bite and enjoy them. Such good flavor and texture. If you are around this market or neighborhood, pay them a visit."
Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,4.6,15,Chinese,5,4-Dec-15,"This is fresh, silky goodness, hand made to order when you order. Go with the prawn or plain chee cheong fun. I found the char siu average and the scallop chewy. Havent tried the abalone.  The wait can be long since everything is made a la minute, but you can spend the time looking at all 20 photos of chow yun fat posing with the proprietors.  (Apparently, they didnt want to take his money when they saw him but he insisted)  One of the best chee cheong funs in sg. Chow yun fat might even agree!"
Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,4.6,15,Chinese,5,30-Jul-13,"if any stall can define pek kio food centre then Pin Wei is it! even the business photo for the food centre shows a plate of Pin Wei's craftsmanship!  a customized JIT set up with 2 identically rectangular flat steamers lying alongside another similarly sized, greased, flat work surface where a liquid rice mixture flows in from one end onto muslin cloths lining the steamers, gets subjected to the laws of science regarding a change of physical state then undressed by being separated from it's host clothing to reveal a slippery smooth, silky thin cheong fun before being rolled to give extra depth or in cases where foreign objects such as char siew, prawns, scallops or abalone were introduced, to provide a seductively sheer yet protective layer for them foreign talent, then cut up into bite sizes as it emerges at the other end of this continuous work flow, minimally moisturized with a slightly sweet light soy sauce, fragrantly peppered with sesame seeds and further spiced up, as you deem fit, with homemade chilli.  this, is a precision assembly line that will meet ISO 9001 standards at hawker prices.  this, is a master handcrafted product that will gluttonously glide down your throat to your eagerly awaiting bellies.  this, is satisfaction guaranteed or your money ......................... is out of pocket!:)"
Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,4.6,15,Chinese,4,8-Oct-12,"If I am ever in Pek Kio, fretting over the long lines at Wah Kee Prawn Noodles, we will always order this chee cheong fun.  The chee chong fun are made on the spot when you order, and it is like those served in HK dimsum restaurants. These are thin and soft, either plain, with char siew, or shrimps, or scallops or abalone.  I actually like the plain ones as they comes with a good sesame oil/soy sauce mixture which is really yummy. Shrimps one comes a second for me."
Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,4.6,15,Chinese,5,16-May-16,"Worth the wait!  The rice rolls are nice and thin, the shrimp is plump and moist and the BBQ pork is finely chopped. Prices are on point."
Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,4.6,15,Chinese,5,31-May-18,"A must stop for me if I ever have a chance to visit Singapore again! The chee cheong fun were so tasty, they brought back all the wonderful childhood memories that I had when it came to this type of food. I love all the different meats or just the plain ones with soy sauce."
Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,4.6,15,Chinese,5,31-Mar-18,They only do one type dish here- the only choice you have is what type of meat you want in it-but they do it to perfection! Highly recommended.
Hong Kong Style Chee Cheong Fun,4.6,15,Chinese,5,31-Mar-13,"Extremely tasty and soft, fresh -- unlike any you are likely to find in a restaurant. A must go to have...."
Vietnamese Stall - Sim Lim Square Food Court,4.3,4,Vietnamese,3,13-Dec-15,"One of the things I am always craving are Pho and Bun Bo Hue so when I went to Sim Lim Square form some electronics accessories, I was happy to see that there was a Vietnamese food stall in the basement, part of the Broadway foodcourt.  I got the Spicy Beef Noodles Soup which I assumed would be Bun Bo Hue. I believe it was but it lacked depth and the different sorts of beef (i really missed the pork knuckle and the black pudding) which make me love this Vietnamese noodle soup so much. But hey, it was only 6 S$, so I'll be forgiving and forget the fact that it was a tad salty and greasy for my liking and highlight that it came with a sizable portion of beef, something which is not common in foodcourts.  Would I eat this again? Not really, only if I happen to pass by this foodcourt again as it did not look like other options were much better but I would certainly not go out of my way for this.  Arguably, I've never been to Vietnam so maybe I am not entitled for having an opinion on how Vietnamese food should taste but I have spend considerable parts of my life eating Pho both at my Vietnamese friends homes and in Vietnamese restaurants in Paris, SoCal and Philly, all of which have sizeable Vietnamese communities so sue me for having an opinion... Or send me a message if you know where to get a delicious Bun Bo Hue or Pho in Singapore!"
Vietnamese Stall - Sim Lim Square Food Court,4.3,4,Vietnamese,4,17-Mar-13,"This is a review of a early dinner from the Vietnamese Stall at Broadway Food Court in the basement of Sim Lim Square.  This food court is almost always clean and neat. Tables are quickly cleaned and cleared by the staff. Even when busy, I am usually able to quickly find a table to squeeze into. For whatever reason, choping is not as common here.  http://tinyurl.com/bmumgnb  While not necessarily friendly, the staff is fast and efficient. The stall is kept clean and neat.  http://tinyurl.com/cutg9dq  They serve a number of Vietnamese staples from pho and bun bo hue to banh mi.  http://tinyurl.com/cxhg3wn  Spicy Chicken Noodles - I ordered a chicken with noodles dish. I quite liked it. it had a nice pep to the spice level. The chicken was tender. The noodles were well-prepared. The portion was relatively generous.  http://tinyurl.com/bnh82dt  The cost was $4.50.  Overall - If you live in the neighbourhood or shop at Sim Lim. I consider this a nice option for quick bite to eat. It will fill you up. It will not empty your wallet. It is fast. Plus, it is pretty darn good."
Vietnamese Stall - Sim Lim Square Food Court,4.3,4,Vietnamese,5,3-Nov-14,"This is great food! The Pho Boa is as good as you would get from Vietnam. With Pho, the most important thing is the soup. If you got that right, all else follows and they have it perfectly.  The other items are also good. The spring rolls and egg rolls are made to order so they taste fresh. The beef stew is fantastic. Tender and flavourful. This is good simple food at good prices.  I also should say, the owner is very nice and sweet. She always has a big smile and works hard. Love this place!!"
Vietnamese Stall - Sim Lim Square Food Court,4.3,4,Vietnamese,5,23-Mar-19,Great bum bo hue with ham and beef. My wife loves it. The soup is very nice and spicy hot. The ham and bee hoon too little. Must add more to be full. Keep up the good work !
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,23-Mar-24,Creamy coconut based soup with a bit of spice. This dish was meant to be eaten by the spoonful and each one was smooth yet creamy at the same time.  I came here before the stall opened and was surprised there wasn't more people waiting. I noticed this stall was the only one with an organized queue setup.  Their laksa was so affordable at S$4 a bowl. Please note that it's easier to pay with cash. There are some limitations with Apple Pay. The only regret I have is not getting 10 more bowls.  This is easily one of my top 3 must eats in Singapore.
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,9-Apr-24,"A bit out of the way around Little India, but worth going to this staple laksa stand. No chopsticks, just a spoon so you get that broth/noodle combo from each bite. The coconut broth is phenomenal. Just a hint of spiciness for an enhanced flavor along with the fish cakes and cockles. Cool how they make theirs in a charcoal stove, the old fashioned way. A bowl goes for SG$4."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,26-Apr-24,"I was in Singapore and wanted to try a traditional dish or a dish of Singapore and one of the dishes that came up was laksa, to be honest I wasn't sure what it was but was going to try it anyway haha. The women working here are fast and efficient and very nice. It didn't take long for them to take the orders and make it. Laksa is pretty much a fish soup has noodles , fish cake and some type of clams or muscles lol I'm not 100% sure what was in it but it was good and I also got some chili paste on it for a little kick!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,10-Jan-24,Small but powerful -- this laksa is well worth waiting in the long line.  This is a lesson in coconut milk lemakness. The broth is rich and flavorful and the spice is well balanced. An absolute delight.  These small bowls are lighter on ingredients but it's all about the noodles and rich broth here. Come in between mealtimes but still expect 15-20 min waits.
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,5-Mar-24,The Laksa here is amazing! I recommend ordering 2 for a normal guy. Add extra fish cakes and bean sprouts...yummy Get a beer from the stall opposite corner and sit and eat like a local. This place is off the beaten path and a nice walk afterwards when you are full of terrific Laksa. A normal bowl is $4 SD. How can you beat that? Do a late lunch and you are good for the night!
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,18-Jan-23,"I'm so glad we made time to grab Laksa before leaving Singapore, and at Sungei Road Laksa too! Our friend had visited before and mentioned this spot was the place to go, so we all obliged and woke up early in the morning.  - SERVICE/ENVIRONMENT - They have a line queue set up, whereas none of the other stalls do, so if that isn't telling you this has to be pretty good, I don't know how else to convince you! There was a line when we arrived, but it moves fairly quick as they continuously make bowls of Laksa as people line up, assuming you aren't going to order just one!  - FOOD - Laksa ($4.00): Yup, that's all - $4.00 for a bowl of goodness. Although it is smaller than your usual noodle bowl, it was enough for a single serving, at least to fill you up hunger-wise... you'll probably want more than one bowl taste-wise! So creamy and so flavorful, with clams and fish inside too. This was definitely one of my favorite foods after visiting Singapore!  - OVERALL - Don't skip Laksa at Sungei Road Laksa. Make the time to come at least once!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,15-May-24,"Seriously the OG. The best laksa in singapore hands down. Love them, but just be prepared for a queue almost whole day but that just shows its popularity!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,19-Feb-23,"I knew Laksa was an uniquely Singaporean dish that people had to try but I never had any interest, mainly because I assumed that it would be really spicy. I was eventually convinced to try and came to Sungei Road Laksa off of a highly-rated recommendation.  This stall had the most people and that's always a good sign. It moved at a slower-than expected pace, just because it looks like they're constantly making bowls of laksa so I'm not sure what the hold up is. Once you order, they add everything in like an assembly line. You can opt out of the chili sauce (which I did) since I heard it really adds some heat.  I really didn't expect to like it but this was one of my favorite meals! The soup base is curry, thin enough to be a soup but still had some thickness to it, which helps it stick onto the noodles. If I remember correctly, there were fish cakes and cockles too. The noodles are cut with scissors into manageable pieces (no need for messy slurping!).  For SGD$4 a bowl, you're really doing yourself a disservice if you don't try their laksa. Highly recommend making a pit stop here for a quick bite!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,12-Jan-23,"When in Singapore of course we had to try laksa! This place is super popular and we came first thing in the morning. There was already a moderately sized line but luckily it moved pretty quickly.  The laksa here was super creamy and not too spicy. There's only one size for the bowls and they're pretty small, but for the price they're still a steal! I honestly prefer the smaller size because it leaves me with more room to try other stands, and you can always order 2 bowls if you're feeling extra hungry.  I thought it was a little weird that they don't provide chopsticks and even have a sign stating so, but apparently the noodles are pre-cut to make them easier to scoop up with a spoon. We had no problem inhaling our bowl with just the provided soup spoon!  Overall, delicious food for a good price. A must-try if you're in Singapore!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,30-Nov-22,"I saw a lot of food reviews recommending this place for Laksa so my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. Laksa was the only thing that they had on the menu and it was 3 sgd per bow if you dine in and 4 sgd if you're doing takeaway. The laksa itself came with some calms, bean sprout, some minced meat, and sliced fish cake. If you want any extra toppings or noodle they are 1sgd each.  We went there at around 2/3 on a Saturday and the wait was around 20min. I had very high expectation based on the reviews that I have read but I have to say I was a little disappointed. I thought the laksa would be very flavorful but the flavor of the spices was not as prominent as I thought it would be. There's this laksa instant noodle from the brand prima taste (you can get them from Asian grocery store!) and I would say the laksa from that instant noodle has even deeper flavors than this laksa that I tried. Don't get me wrong, this laksa was still good especially with its price but I don't think it was worth the wait. I would not go there if the line is longer than a 10min wait."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,9-Aug-22,"This is what my Laksa dreams were made of. Coming fresh off of Malaysia, I didn't get the chance to eat Laksa and my travel research told me this was the place to come to.  The laksa was cooked over charcoal and was very creamy and came with large raw cockles (they asked if I wanted them...she smelled a naive tourist). The noodle soup can only be eaten with a soup spoon (no chopsticks needed or provided). I absolutely loved the taste of Laksa and you could spice it up as you wish, which was provided on the side of the bowl."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,13-May-23,"This laksa is delicious, some o of the best I've tasted. Singapore is where I first met and rapidly fell in love with laksa. Laksa outside of Singapore doesn't measure up, at least those which I've tried. This laksa place is in a sort of hidden hawker food court, but they continuously had a well organized line. The service was friendly and as fast as could be given that each bowl is freshly assembled and there's always a line. The laksa is delicious as is, but you can add extra toppings for slight adders to the price. One bowl of laksa was right for me, but the bowls are not huge and I saw many people buying 2 bowls for just themselves. Each order is very reasonably priced at 4 Singapore dollars (about $3 US). I only saw bowls of laksa being served, but it seemed most people bought drinks from other vendors in the food court or brought their own. I did see several people enjoying a beer with their laksa, and there's a convenience store only a two minute walk away. If I lived here, I'd eat here every week."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,1-Dec-22,Great memories on the childhood laksa. Bowl size is perfect for the $3 portion. Tried it at least once in your lifetime!
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,23-Mar-23,"This is Singapore's best laksa. 5 stars!  One star for delicious laksa. Not too much coconut cream and full of tasty dried shrimp. The broth is cooked on a charcoal fire, giving it a delightful old school smoky flavour. The rice noodles are just right, not too mushy like the thinner or thicker versions. Simple great tasting laksa, not overly complicated (I'm sure it's complicated to prepare!) And unpretentious.  One star for location. They unfortunately had to move because the previous landlord kicked them out and took over selling their version of laksa. This new (well, at least 15? Years old) location is in a coffee shop. More seats!  One star for price. It's getting pricier.  One star for Will I Come Back? Yes please."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,20-Dec-22,Food was amazing and the fragrance of The spicy gravy was mouth watering . Temp hot noodles quickly served up when Leder
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,22-Nov-22,Best Laksa ever! Hard to put in words you just have to try if your a Laksa fan. Always a line but moves pretty fast. It's kind of a residential area within a little strip mall. Parking is not a problem. I would give Sungei 6 stars if it was a larger bowl. Def a must try !
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,6-Nov-22,"Best laksa for my taste buds! Spicy , savory and every bite was a wow! Parking is not much of a problem. Usually a line but we'll worth it. If it was a bigger bowl I would give a five star rating. I will be back!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,17-May-19,"Laksa is a popular Southeast Asia spicy noodle soup with rice noodle in coconut milk curry soup. I'm not a big fan of curry but had to try it out. It was good and definitely worth a try if you can handle some heat. Even though I don't like curry, I still enjoyed it.  Sungei road seems to be the best but we also tried the laksa in the Colony buffet (in Ritz Carlton) and thought the quality is pretty similar but this laksa is a fraction of the price. $3 for a small bowl."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,29-Apr-19,"Laska is not my thing and after trying this still not my thing. I love noodles and soup, but I prefer simpler and clear broth. Although I'm not a fan of this soup, I can see why it's popular with the flavor profile of curry, coconut and chili.  Bowls are small, but good size. If you're from the Americas think of it as a small chicken bowl size or a bowl of soboro don. Noodles are cut, only utensils available are spoons. Which fits perfectly for every bite and easily able to get a spoonful of noodle and fish balls and cakes.  $3SGD. How can you go wrong with something flavorful. If it was my kind of food, I would eat this again and again just like the locals. Don't be alarmed at the long line. They serve it rather quickly. It ain't no howlin rays kind of wait, if you're from LA."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,21-Jan-23,"Definitely authentic food, hand mixers bowl by bowl, coal burning. Bunch of other street vendors in the same food Hall. Will definitely be back. Bring your own napkins. Lady taking order & collecting cash very friendly, but the lady making the food was unfriendly, didn't want any pictures taken. If going at busy hours,"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,12-Sep-18,"A little shop amongst 15~20 other little stands serving amazing authentic food. No frills, they're not there to entertain you. Walk up, tell them how many bowls of the delicious yellow soup you'd like, pay and pick up your food. No chopsticks provided at this shop which is kind of funny because you're eating noodles. But the spoon will force you to slurp up all the soup along with the noodle. Not a bad idea actually.  This bowl is TINY especially compared to American standards. I could probably eat 3 of these alone. Each bowl is only $3, so luckily I could comfortably afford all three bowls. BUT I didn't. I wanted to save my stomach for all the other goodies around here!  Fyi this was a tiny bit spicy.. just the way I like it. And there are little clams in there (so yummy!!!!) --in case you're allergic.  Highly recommend!!!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,18-Apr-18,"Best Laksa of life! Extremely affordable; $3 for a small bowl. Broth made traditionally with charcoal. Creamy coconut milk paired with spices, herbs and spicy sambal together create a sublime bowl of laksa. I love the hint of freshness from raw clams. Sungei Road Laksa do not give out chopsticks but rather, pre-cut noodles so you can inhale it with a spoon. The flavour profile really changes with every bite; sambal, clam, herbs, ouff tofu.  One of the best thing I ate in Singapore! I licked the bowl when no one is looking! Definitely worth traveling for!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,19-Mar-17,"$1.40 USD for a bowl of Singaporean laksa (the stuff most common in the States). Score!  The real deal. Chili, turmeric, lemongrass, other fresh herbs and fermented shrimp all lovingly cooked off before adding shrimp stock, clam stock, and coconut milk, simmered over a charcoal fire.  A handful of pre cooked noodles. Warm it by pouring the hot soup over it and dumping it out a few times. Add cockles and home made fish cake steamed over an open fire. A little side of the chili base and that's it.  No chopsticks. You eat this with a spoon. The noodles are very soft (overcooked by Western standards) but somehow it just works.  The flavor, a punch to the palate, is unmatched in depth and complexity. Very strong seafood flavor, herbaceous notes, rich from coconut with a long fermented finish. It makes the laksa at the best place in my hometown taste like water in comparison.  Washed down with a fresh squeezed calamansi juice to kill the spice. Satisfaction achieved.   ps. Because of the wood fire, the flavor beats that of the more famous three number spot with Gordon Ramsay affiliation. Just saying."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,5-Sep-17,"The laksa here is so good. And at $3 it really is a steal.  It's located at a hawker stall. After reading the reviews about it being small, my wife and i ordered 3 between us. Seemed to be a good amount for breakfast.  As other reviews mentioned there's no chopsticks. But since the noodles were cut up I didn't find this to be a problem at all."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,16-Aug-17,"This is a simple bowl of laksa. No frills. I like the renovated stall. You only have one option now. Strictly $3 per bowl. No upsize. I saw people order two bowls for themselves after they requested for large and was told only one size.  It is not a big bowl but it can be filling, especially when you also order a drink. It is without chopsticks (also stated clearly at the stall - I think they got tired of people asking) like the original katong laksa in katong.  It comes with just bean sprouts, sliced fish cake slivers and cockles. None of those fancy prawns, taupok or even crayfish in other versions. Mix the chili into the gravy to get the red gravy we are used to seeing. It is not that spicy.  Now that I like cockles, this is the place for my fix. It is chockfull of it. The first time I tried it was over 10 years ago before the renovation and I was not that into it. Maybe because it was hot and muggy, plus I did not care for such a small bowl with simple ingredients then."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,2-Jan-23,Best laksa in Singapore. Worth a visit every time. Inexpensive authentic and clean with great service
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,13-Aug-18,"Laksa so good. There won't be a line if you come early. At $3 SGD, this is a steal. The broth was so creamy and delicious - I wish I had doubled down on the order. Definitely worth the visit!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,4-Jan-19,"Laksa here is so good! Tasty and rich in flavor. Line is always long, but goes by pretty fast. Bowl is a bit small, but its not pricy either. Love the combination of the fish cake, cockles, creamy coconut curry milk broth spices and noodles - everything blended so well just slurp up all the liquid yumminess! Delicious and worth a visit!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,26-Mar-18,"As soon as we landed in Singapore, we were planning our food adventure. The first stop was Sungei Road Laksa, which was conveniently located within a 10 minute walk of our Airbnb.  We shared a bowl of this delicious soup and were tempted to get more but knew that we had many other things to try. I loved the creaminess from the coconut milk paired with all the spices to give this dish a nice kick."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,8-Apr-18,Overall great Laksa- love the small bowl portion size. I didnt enjoy the clams in it however and i picked them all out. The food centre had large fans that def helped in cooling the place down to enjoy the food.
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,21-Dec-18,"The bowls of laksa at Sungei Road Laksa, located in a small hawker center, are small but packed with flavor! You can tell this place is popular just from the lanes they've set up to organize guests waiting in line, and for a cheap, uniform price of $3, you get a flavor-packed bowl of rice noodles in coconut milk curry broth, topped with fish cake, cockles, herbs, and chili paste on the side! Interestingly, they also have a big sign on their stall that says ""no chopsticks,"" and you're only given a spoon to eat the dish, ensuring that you slurp up all the liquidy goodness!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",3,12-Dec-17,"Good place to get decent Laksa  Recommended, but with caveats (read on...)  We were out shopping and in the mood for Laksa, and this place was highly recommended.  Food: We kept it simple and ordered only Laksa (and Kueh Pie Tee from next door). The Laksa was flavorful, even if the gravy was a bit thin. It was available with cockles, which was disappointing since some places will happily substitute prawns. And they sell only one size, which I would call small. The Kueh Pie Tee was tasty, but with ground peanuts is not traditional Nonya style.  Cost: At $3 for a bowl, the Laksa is an excellent value.  Service: Good, the queue was quite long, but went quickly. The uncles were quick to clear away the bowls after.  Atmosphere: This is a coffee shop (no aircon).  Overall: If you're in the area and craving Laksa, it's definitely worth stopping here."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,18-Feb-19,"Sungei Road Laksa was one of the more popular laksa-selling places I found online. When I arrived, there was already a sizable line that had formed. After I got in line, another large wave of people appeared out of nowhere and the line pretty much doubled in size (the amount of people waiting here speaks to its popularity).  The laksa was super cheap and looked delicious; HOWEVER, the portion size was extremely small. They do not give you chopsticks and only provide you with a small soup spoon to slurp up all of the noodles in the bowl, but I didn't find this to be a problem at all. The coconut flavor was pretty strong, but after I finished my bowl, I found that the overall flavor was not as strong as I was expecting. I liked the spices and seasoning in the broth as they were not overwhelmingly heavy. I thought that I would still be starving after downing such a tiny bowl, but I was surprisingly content. That being said, I easily could have had another bowl.  For me, Sungei Road Laksa was a delicious introduction to laksa (first time trying it!). Although the line here may deter some visitors, I would definitely recommend giving this place a try if you're in the area."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,5-Mar-18,"Worth the hype and the trek! This seemingly humble bowl of $3 SD laksa is packed with a heavenly blend of sweet, sour, spicy and lots of umami....after one spoonful I already wanted another bowl!  I arrived around 11AM and waited only about 10-15 minutes, building up my appetite as my eyes feasted on watching the aunties stirring and ladling big spoonfuls of soup over a charcoal stove. The soup is fills you with umami and fresh cockles and packed with strong flavors of chili and curry, all balanced out by sweet coconut milk which lightens the broth to be perfect. A noodle soup is good when you drink it to the last drop and that's exactly what it did."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,22-Dec-19,"When we got to this hawker center, we immediately saw sungei road laksa as a line had formed. After a small wait, we got out bowl of delicious laksa.  The soup in the dish was delicious and had a nice coconut flavor to it. The noodles were also smooth and the protein went well with dish.  Overall it was a good bowl of laksa for the price you pay. Would eat here again if I'm in Singapore again."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,16-Jun-17,"$3 SGD for a delicious bowl of laksa served the traditional way with no chopsticks. I came here at 10:30 in the morning and there was already a line with 3 people in front of me. With only one item being served and only one size, ordering was a breeze. When it's your turn, just let them know how many bowls when you're standing in the queue.  Watching them prepare a bowl of laksa was fascinating all on its own as they use the broth to blanch your bowl of noodles multiple times. The bowl is then topped off with a scoop of cockles and some homemade fish cake, and definitely ask to get it spicy since they put the chili paste on the side of the bowl. Taking my first sip of the broth made me realize that all the laksa I've had before was by no means on par with Sungei Road. The soup has layers upon layers of flavors starting from the sweetness of the coconut to the saltiness of the shrimp paste, the complex blends that builds the curry, and finally the spiciness from the chili paste.  Eating a bowl of noodles without chopsticks is quite hard especially since the noodles are pretty long, don't wear a white shirt by the way! The bowl of laksa is small by comparison but a perfect size if you plan on eating something else afterwards."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,14-Apr-17,"These small bowls of intensity are elevated by a scoop - yes, a scoop - of cockles. I'd never seen anyone so cavalierly scoop spoonfuls of cockles out of a big bucket of cockles before. To me, cockles are things you laboriously pry open for minutes on end just for one sweet bite. Having 7 of them in one bowl was unimaginably decadent.  Also, the broth: while it's coconutty, that's not the dominant taste. It's funky and green and very spicy if you choose to mix the whole dollop of chili in.  They don't let you use chopsticks, which I don't understand, unless it's to recreate the frustration of trying to get cockles out of their shells; the noodles are too slippery and long to be held by the spoons and you end up slurping them right out of the bowl. Luckily, that's not considered rude in Asia."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,17-Jul-21,"A very local food court. Food is cheap and good. I tried the laksa (they have only one item so no menu needed!), it's very authentic. When I was in line, a local elder gentleman told me he's been coming to this place for laksa for decades. A truly historical food spot!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",3,29-Dec-16,"Came at 11:45am or so and there was a very minimal wait. About 3-4 people ahead of me. When I left around 12:05, there was a long queue of 15-20 people. With 3-4 people ahead of me, it took maybe 5-7 minutes to get through, so it definitely goes by pretty quickly.  $3 SGD for this bowl of noodles. The soup was good, but not as rich as I expected for laksa. One bowl is probably not enough for a meal, but a great snack size. The noodles were quite soft, a bit too soft for my liking. Almost don't have to chew...  Ordering system is a bit quirky. You tell them how many bowls you want, when there are still customers in front of you, so they can start preparing them. Its quite interesting to watch them work. It seems like they have the process down to a science. The number of scoops of soup in and out of bowls, etc. And they work with a charcoal stove.  No chopsticks, only spoons, but they cut the noodles into spoon size portions for ultimate speedy consumption.  I would recommend trying."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,6-Nov-16,"Awesome place for laksa. They only give spoons, but luckily they cut the noodles so it wasn't too hard to eat. The flavors are spicy and savory, and they also had plenty of seafood pieces throughout the whole bowl!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,15-Nov-16,"Where to find a bowl of traditional and yummy Laksa in Singapore without burning a hole in your pocket? Well, its right here at Jalan Berseh in a humble corner of a coffeeshop. Considering bowls of laksa that we had eaten before, nowadays, how many of them still have the gravy cook over charcoal fire?  There are a few stalls named Sungei Road Laksa, apparently they are not affiliated with this stall as they have openly declared on their signage that there are no other branches. Sungei Road Laksa is a family business and you can the family members each having their dedicated tasks. You can observed the flow of their ordering process while you are in the long snaky queue.  What makes a perfect bowl of Laksa? I'm not a fan of Laksa with strong ""Lemak"" (Coconut Milk"" gravy and Sungei Road Laksa has a well balance of all flavours in a simple $3 portion bowl. Just like the traditional way of eating, there is no use of chopsticks for the noodles as the long noodles were  Laksa - $3  Gravy is not spicy and that is one of the reasons why I started loving it when I was a kid. Ingredients are simple with cockles, slices of fishcakes, laksa leaves and chilli to add some spicy kick to the bowl.  I wouldn't say no to this comfort bowl of childhood favourite. They are opened daily 9.30am to 5pm but closed on Wednesday. I bet you will feel the same that the queue is worth waiting for!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,7-May-16,"easily a five stars review! but i also procrastinate to write, easily.  easy menu options, small bowl($3) or big bowl($4)? out of town visitors, from my motherland, in queue in front of me were debating what they should order? i had to step in and yelp! they then proceeded to show me photos of rojak? so i said only laksa here and no, it is not the katong kind! the sign above the stall clearly says sungei road laksa?! in any case, once it's your turn to order, just say big or small and perhaps how many, thanks.  easy on the wallet and stomach, cheap and not too jelak(cloyingly rich)! yes, even the big bowl may not be enough for the ravenously hangry. but remember, everything in moderation and you might live to 100!  so yes, the easiest part about coming here is finishing that small bowl. if you are not fuss about how cooked your cockles are, you can be done in 3 mins? if you prefer less bloodiness, submerge your cockles and leave to sit for a minute or two? still, you can easily up and go 5mins after receiving your bowl!  that's where the easy parts end.  folks, get the timing right. some have missed out because they keep coming on a wednesday when they are......CLOSED! also they are more a morning/lunch business, so come early as they will close as and when they sell out.  the queue can be long but it does move fast. however, you might still sweat a little as it is rather hot and stuffy in this coffeeshop.  the essential use of charcoal fire ensures the right temperature and imparts a smokiness that cannot be replicated otherwise. so it is anything but easy to make that tiny bowl. just look at the prep that goes on behind the scene before each bowl can be slurped.  finally, coming here is also not easy. not near mrt or bus station, walking is required unless you drive, uber, grab or cab here. nevertheless, i can easily predict that you will be back!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,7-Nov-16,"On a Monday at 11:30am? No wait!  The clams. So fresh, so clean clean. The fresh clams itself is worth $3. So I ordered two bowls. If you're used to the US equivalent of a small pho bowl, then you have to order two bowls.  I'm sure there are better laksa places for the locals, but this will do the job if you're visiting and wanted to see what the hype is all about!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,18-Dec-18,"The food has been phenomenal  Laksa was awesome, it was cheap yet heavy.."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,17-Jan-14,"I ate the best bowl of Laksa at Sungei Road Laksa and I think now there is no turning back!  My sister was complaining when I made her follow me and took the trek to have mid morning snack. Maybe I should took a taxi but my google map app told me that it was like 15 minute walk from my hotel.  But it was all worth it when she ate that whole bowl all by herself! It was empty and she even drank all the soup when I went and get us a barley drink!  I ended up getting one for myself! It only cost $2! The soup base has so much depth: spicy, sweet, salty and creamy! I love the cockies! I love the noodle! I love how I can eat the whole thing with a spoon.  Worth getting there early to beat the rush as it was not busy at all when I was there. I can have a few more rounds if I wanted!  Maybe I should have a few more bowls! Extra Spicy please!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,1-Dec-15,"This is really as good as it gets!  The only thing that could beat the rating would be if this is in an air conditioned food court.  The laksa gravy is not too thick and it brought out the goodness in the creamy not so spicy soup. Even though the bowl of laksa only costs $3, but I always take a cab to eat it since it is pretty far from my place. But as you know, it just means it is worth more than $3 since I am willing to cab over. ;)"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,26-Jul-20,"Nice laksa, will definitely come back for more, i lile laksa too so this is perfect! Laksa is like laksa"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",3,30-Jan-16,"Normally the queue is huge but today there was none so quickly took the opportunity to try this place.  The broth is tasty and better than most Singaporean laksa places, but lacked the ""oomph"" I'm used to from Malaysian varieties.  A good (massive) dose of sambal would help. Otherwise for $3 a bowl, it's a pretty good deal."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,21-Nov-15,"Slap your momma good, haha, really for the price and what you get you this is a can't miss. If you are visitor to Singapore, and want to get some laksa you might want to try couple of places before here because it ain't the same anywhere else. Either you think something costs way more than here or it is not as good. Suck it up, stand in line, get large bowls of laksa, sit down and slurp.  I was expecting half hype, half failure when I stood in line but I was pretty much blown away by the price point and the quality of food. First of all the color of it look amazing, than the amount of fresh cockles you get in your order was way more than what $4 will get you, I was expecting 3 or 4 pieces but it was a nice big spoonful of them. I went for a late lunch so the line wasn't as bad, it seemed liked all the other food stalls were dead except here.  Come here. get in line, and slurp away."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,8-Jan-17,"Truly this place deserves a /5 rating.  This place is small and lunch room style seating, but the food is so damn good. If you are in Singapore and want Laksa this is the place to be.  Always a long line but worth the wait. Staff are friendly and you simply pay by the bowl no other options. Here it is only 3 SGD, so I feel that this is a great deal."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,10-Dec-18,"The laksa here is definitely tasty and rich. The laksa gravy is the main character of the dish. I would give the taste of this dish 5 stars.  However, I believe the service can be better. When I came here during one of the Saturdays, the staff was able a bit rude and impatient to us. On normal days, they are fine. I would recommend this to anyone who are looking for tasty and delicious laksa."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,30-Jan-16,"While I cannot profess to be a connoisseur of laksa as a speciality dish, I will say that I know a bowl of tasty when it's put in front of me. For foreigners and visitors alike, this laksa stall is the perfect example of a local no frills hawker if you want to experience the authentic experience.  The laksa itself is well balanced, and isn't overly rich like many others I've tasted. The noodles are cooked well, and the slices of fish cakes and herbs that top off the dish is just perfect. Note that this does come with fresh, raw, cockles. As I once heard something about cockles carrying hepatitis...I pick those out. All in all, this is a great deal for only SGD$3!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,30-Mar-18,"3.5-4/5  I prefer Katong Laksa over this place, while they do seem to take the Laksa making art more seriously (at least by the expressions on their face), for me the one size only (small) and the lighter broth doesn't win me over easily.  Expect a lineup if you go during lunch hour.  Repeat: No"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,4-May-16,"I like my laksa chock full of seafoody goodness, so this really hit the spot. Served with cockles and sliced fish cake only, no chicken, prawns, or taupok. This is the first time I've had laksa with only a spoon, and I now appreciate why they do so. It really tastes fantastic when you slurp it all up by the spoonful! They heat the laksa stock over charcoal - not sure if it adds to the flavour per se but whatever they're doing works.  I went there at about 1:30-2pm, and business was still brisk. Queue wasn't long but it was still a good 10-15 wait."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,19-Dec-14,"Laksa is a must try dish while visiting Singapore, and Sungei Road Laksa is your MUST GO place to get laksa in Singapore. Yelpers gave another great suggestion and this place definitely did not disappoint.  The place is located in a more residential part of town. I actually took a taxi here as it wasn't very close to any subways stations. But it was so worth it! Its one of 5 stalls in a smaller hawker center. So order your food, watch them cook it, and take your order to any open table.  They only sell one item (not even drinks), but its so good! Their laksa broth is creamy and flavorful, yet still light. You get a choice of spicy or not spicy. The spicy comes with a spoonful of chili sauce. Get it spicy, as it provides a good kick without the burning sensation. I rarely ever finish the soup when I eat noodles as I always feel like restaurant soup noodles use a lot of msg or salt in their soup. However, this was one of those times where I drank all the soup, licked the bowl, and still wanted more!  I love the cockles they have in the soup. It has that seafood freshness and sweet taste, which I've never had before.  The bowl is really small, but is only $2 SGD. The taxi driver suggested I order 2 bowls since the bowls are small. He was right, and 2 bowls were just perfect!  They don't sell drinks. Instead, you'll see a lady come by from another stall taking drink orders. I brought my own bottled water, so I declined. But the lady sells juices and beer. There's also another old lady that comes by to sell you tissue packets, just in case you weren't carrying any on you. (No napkins provided here either.)  FYI, they don't give you chopsticks for these noodles, and you don't really need them. The spoon they provide is enough to finish all the noodles and soup!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,14-Nov-12,"This is the most delicious Laksa that I have ever had on my entire Singapore trip.  Cockles were sweet and fresh, the Laksa noodles were al dente and the broth is amazingly tasty. The broth has bold flavors of coconut milk, shrimp paste, spice paste....etc. You won't get thirsty after having this soup, but you may want to get a jug of Sugarcane juice or barley soup to cease the ""fire"".  The only cons that I can think of is the long queue. This place has no airconditioning and the queue is long. However, watching ""uncle"" make the broth on the charcoal fire in a bronze soup pan is quite entertaining. His facial expressions look very calm and zen, even in this kind of hot weather. The way how he stirs the broth is like exercising Tai chi. It's definitely worth waiting for it.  I highly recommend my Yelpers to have Sungei road Laksa."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,23-Jan-18,"Excellent bowl of laksa! Yes it is a small bowl so order a big bowl or additional bowl. Some said is expensive due to the potion but i said is extremely affordable for everybody. The gravy will automatically be finished once you cleared all the ingredients as well. Ok, just finished all the gravy because is delicious!  Avoid peak hours (i avoid weekends), no air con this coffeeshop, people are friendly there to share a table with you."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,24-Jan-15,"Craving for a bowl of good affordable laksa?? This is one place you will find it.  Located at Jalan Berseh Road near the Jalan Berseh Food Centre & along the Old Sungei Road is a small hawker centre where this bowl of traditional laksa is served.  Prepared in the old style of cooking in a Charcoal Stove, the gravy is excellent till the last drop, it is not too thick nor spicy, it is just right. The aroma of this laksa will draw you to them & excite your tastebuds. It is a favorite of the businees crowd and the residents of the area.  If you are up for something traditional and local, this is one you must must try."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",3,12-Aug-17,Came here because of the positive yelp reviews. A bowl is only $3. It's good if you like a creamy curry taste and don't mind the hunks of fish that taste really fishy. The noodles are really good.
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,26-Sep-12,"Raw cockles, charcoal fired laksa soup, eat it with a spoon. This has to be the most old school laksa stall left.  Picked by celebrity chef, Andre Chang as his pick for Singapore. ""Started in 1956, this food-stall vendor still uses charcoal to boil his laksa soup, and the price is still only $2! It's the place where I can find the most authentic laksa flavor in Singapore."" --Andr¨¦ Chiang, Restaurant Andre, Singapore"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,8-Oct-12,"I am not a laksa person but this is a good bowl of laksa. The soup is very flavorful, rich and thick.  Bring a pot there, buy the soup home, have a laksa party and make many happy tummies!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",3,4-Jun-19,Noodles is not so well cooked. Having said that I think the portions of the raw cockles is good.
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,2-Apr-16,"In local speak.. Very good lah.  This is my favorite Katong laksa place. I come here straight from the airport (and also make an attempt to come here before I leave). Katong laksa being a signature Singaporean dish.  It's also unique in its own right that you do not eat it with fork or chopsticks, but only with a spoon. I guess that's where half the flavor comes from (the broth).  It's tasty and cheap ($3 !) for that it gets 5 stars alone. Not to mention it's cooked on a charcoal fired stove which adds to the flavor.  This particular place is a family business and very recently got passed down to the next generation, so I'm very happy that we can still enjoy the cheap and tasty goodness that this place has to offer.  The best time to come is around opening time (9-10am) or late lunchtime (around 3pm), otherwise expect a long queue. Personally the morning is the best as the food is the freshest."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",3,25-Nov-17,They only have one size and a bowl of laksa costs $3 SGD only. Came here pretty early and after thirty minutes there were long lines. I thought the soup was okay... I was able to eat it all as the portions are small. It might be because the cockles had a super strong seafood taste that slightly turned me off. The soup itself was good and enjoyable. They only give spoon which made it a little difficult to eat the noodles.
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,29-May-16,"Hands down the best laksa I had in Singapore. I'm not Singaporean so not sure about the authenticity, but just by looking at the way the laksa is prepared, I doubt little has changed over the many years, full respect to the owner for maintaining the tradition and flavour for so long."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,22-Jun-15,"Officially my favorite laksa in Singapore. I had the best bowl of laksa today. Despite the heat and insanely long line, I enjoyed every bite and slurp. You will slurp, I guarantee. The soup is cooked on a charcoal stove and continually stirred. The cook looked very serious going at her craft so it raised my expectations. Not too creamy, it doesn't make you feel sick by the end of the meal. And the portion is really kinda small so you should have two bowls. I made the mistake of ordering just one then I saw the couple next to me get three to share between them two. Argh, the line... I didn't bother to re-line up. Now I know. Come here seriously laksa eaters!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,27-Apr-18,Best Laksa packed with huge favors. I ordered 3 bowls for lunch. I came back the next day for another 3 bowls before leaving Singapore. Worth it!
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,10-Apr-15,"Really long line and pretty good eats but don't be fooled by the $2 price tag. The portions are pretty small so you might want to go ahead and order two, I'm pretty sure you won't want to wait in line again.  I read about this place in my in-flight magazine and apparently they cut up their noodles so that the entire dish can be eaten with just a spoon. How efficient!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,1-Sep-18,Outstanding laksa in an informal setting. Long lines but worth the wait. Don't miss it if you want great laksa.
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",3,25-Apr-18,"I never had laska in my life and was highly anticipating my visit to this shop. While there were a lot of flavors going on, I didn't enjoy the dish and couldn't finish it even though the portion was small. The seafood/brininess was too overpowering for my liking. 3 stars for $3!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,10-Nov-15,Best laksa in town. But they increased their price to $3/bowl for a small bowl. Still long q during peak hours! Really disappointed in the price increased....
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,10-Oct-17,"Really good laksa and it's only $3 a bowl, well worth it. It's the only thing they do and they do it really well. A bit off the beaten path, but definitely the trip."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,17-Nov-14,"If you're looking for authenticity, this is probably as good as it gets. This stall is one of many on the floor, with plastic chairs and tables in the eating area, and can be easily spotted by the queue that's formed in front of it.  I decided to check it out as I love laksa and was intrigued by the good Yelp reviews.  After queuing for what seemed like ages, I got a small bowl with steaming laksa, and from what I could make out, lots of cockles. The broth was not overly spicy, and not thick and rich enough for my taste, but good, and the noodles were ok - pre-cut to provide for easier eating. All for 2 Singapore dollars (ca 1,3 EUR).  Drinks are ordered from the ladies circling the tables, and paid directly with them.  The atmosphere is really very authentic- I was the only caucasian eating there today, and it's a nice refuge from the rain in monsoon season - I escaped a total downpour walking into the stall area :-)  If you're really hungry one bowl won't suffice though, but you'll be spoiled for choice as to what to eat next from the other stalls.  I have had better laksa but for the price and the atmosphere I was glad to have tried it out, and you should, too."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",3,30-Nov-17,This place was highly recommended. I was so disappointed when I tasted it. The laksa I had in Malaysia is way better than this. The laksa was lukewarm in temperature and should be warm. The taste was a bit bland but the ingredients were ok.
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",1,2-Oct-17,"Totally disappointed. Heard and saw lots of good review before visit. The soup based is cooked with gas and warm ONLY via charcoal. Soup base is above the normal salt level. Can taste that their soup is much more salty than most. Soup based not thick as mentioned in other review. Conclusion, not worth the time and surely a disappointment. Tried yesterday 1st Oct 2017 afternoon."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,10-Aug-12,"Why is this one of the best laksas in Singapore? With 328 Katong Laksa trailing behind?  The soup alone has me won over, hands down. With a great mix of coconut milk, spice paste (rempah) and savoury dried shrimp - the laksa broth was adequately creamy yet not too overly spicy so one can just consume it at one shot. If you would like it more spicy, their sambal provided can be mixed in. The cockles and fishcake slices used were good quality ingredients that were fresh off the shelves in the supermarket.  What's best is that it is only $2, where can you find such delicious food at such a great price."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",2,24-Mar-19,"Was looking forward to visiting this place when traveling in Singapore because of the great reviews. Unfortunately, Laksa did not taste good at all, couldn't finish it. They had No pictures sign! I found that a bit ridiculous.."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",3,25-Nov-18,"Caveat: I'm probably not qualified to write this review. I had only tried laksa a couple times before at sit down restaurants, which likely have a completely different approach to this dish. Anyway, being in Singapore, I knew I had to come and try an authentic bowl of laksa. After reading a few google hits on ""best laksa in singapore,"" I saw that this place consistently was mentioned and was closest to my hotel (my mom will walk nowhere in the heat). So we came here. It was located inside a pretty archetypal hawker market. not the cleaner style newer ones that are inside and air conditioned, but an open air alcove of food stalls with just a few ceiling fans to combat the heat. (Note, this place does have bathrooms that don't charge, which is a plus for a hawker market). Anyway, the sungie road laksa stall is located in one of the corners to the market. I'm pretty sure they only serve this one dish, so it's pretty efficient service. However, note that they do not provide chopsticks, which I found weird. Although the laksa noodles are cut short, they still don't fit that well onto the spoon and chopsticks would have been helpful. Moving on. I ordered a bowl for myself and a bowl for my dad. I guess the first thing I noticed was that this version didn't have prawns, which I thought was a sine qua non for laksa. It had only fish cakes and what I thought were clams but what my Singaporean mom said were cockles. So I guess they were cockles. It was not aesthetically pleasing like the laksa I had seen before. Also, while I used to love them, I'm not a huge fan of bivalves anymore because they kind of taste like sand and saltwater to me now. Also they look gross. But how did the whole thing taste? The broth was tasty, though it started getting very spicy toward the end because I mixed the entire dollop of chili paste into my broth. Definitely buy a chaser of water with this dish. The fish cakes had a very light flavor to them, however, the cockles tasted like the aforementioned saltwater and sand, which I didn't prefer, but ate anyway because I was starving. Overall, I guess I was just expecting more. More seafood, more flavor, more presentation. But, my Singaporean dad, who grew up eating laksa, said it was one of the best he had ever had, so I guess it's probably really good to people who know what they are talking about."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,22-Jun-18,It's worth trying ! Just remember to Bring your own chopsticks!!! I purchased a pair from a supermarket before when for it
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,27-Apr-18,"Absolutely delicious. Straightforward bowl of laksa for a good value. I really enjoyed the cockles and how the flavors were a great blend. I just wish they had larger sized portions but with only $3 SD a bowl, getting multiples is an easy solution!"
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,25-Oct-18,Simply put. Delicious laksa. I could not complain about anything at all. The ingredients were perfect. thanks.
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,30-Apr-16,"Fantastic laksa, possibly the best in Singapore. The bowls are fairly small, so it's usually the case that I have to have two to fill myself up. Not inexpensive, but worth it."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,7-May-15,"The price is totally fantastic, you get a small bowl of light and spicy coconut broth served like how we use to eat during primary school, ahhh, those were the day where i pay 50cents of a bowl like this, now that i am older, bring back memories, the ingredients includes fishcakes and cockles and the nice laksa leaves that leave a pleasant after taste, that a wow as you move around to digest your meal and those laksa leaves that stuck around and linger on. my 2nd trip there and definitely counting on but hopefully they located themselves nearer to bugis. if not its a long journey down there."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,12-May-16,"Sungei Road Laksa may serve up one of the simplest bowls of laksa, without modern adornments like eggs, prawns or otah, but what they lack in frills, they compensate with freshness and quality. The illustrious heritage hawker still uses charcoal to fire up his stove, and if you ever thought it was no biggie to use charcoal fire, Sungei Road Laksa will change your mind; it's immediately evident that the smoky char of the fire imbues each bowl of laksa with an irresistibly heady aroma.  The queues may be legendary but clockwork-efficient production of the noodles ensures the line moves fast. But if you're really averse to waiting in line, the best time to hit up Sungei Road Laksa is after the peak lunch hours on weekdays. There's hardly a queue then.  The standard order Laksa ($3) is loaded with beansprouts, fishcake and cockles. The cockles, though petite, are swimmingly fresh and succulent, and lend a briny accent to the rich and robust gravy. If you can take the heat, ask for extra helpings of the sambal chilli to stir into the gravy, it adds a potent punch and complements the laksa base."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",3,29-Aug-17,"I know I shouldn't be expecting flavorful curry that packs a punch/quite a bit of spice with Singaporean curry laksa, but I was still slightly disappointed by my bowl of laksa here. While it made a decent (albeit small) meal, it wasn't necessarily my favorite and didn't leave me impressed. Unsure that I'd make the trip out here again just for the laksa. It is cheap, though -- $3 for a small bowl."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,14-Oct-12,"The laksa itself was served like Katong Laksa style, with only a spoon and no chopsticks.  What was visually appealing was the explosion of colors brimming from side to side. The redness of the cockles matched beautifully with the green of the parsley and the yellowish broth.  The broth itself was very light, not lemak like Katong Laksa, but it was because of this lightness that I especially enjoyed. A tinge of refreshing sweetness, infused with the coconutty flavors.   Gorgeous Laksa  The cockles were not only huge, but very abundantly generous. The textures were just amazing, cooked to perfection. The noodles and bean sprouts added the much needed texture and color as well.  It was so delicious that I literally had 2 and a half bowls at one go. And let me say, I rarely consume so much food at one go. Every bit of laksa flavor had me intoxicated and just clamoring for more."
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",4,22-May-17,Good laksa use to eat there years ago when it was only 50cts. Now is already over 3$ but the laksa is still good . Strong laksa favor.
Sungei Road Laksa,4.4,88,"Singaporean, Chinese, Noodles",5,26-Aug-14,"Best laksa in the city. It's not a restaurant, it's not even a cafe. Just the place where some people cook this great soup for just S$2."

Their menu and ordering process was all done entirely on the phone, but was quick easy to use.  For the table, we got a wide assortment of food--Three plates of Stewed Pork Belly ($9 each), a large plate of Chicken Feet ($6), a plate of beancurd ($4), two bowls of rice ($2 each), and a side platter set that included peanuts, tofu, and egg ($3). I also ordered a Honey Lemon Tea ($2), which was perfectly refreshing with the hot weather, and tasted better than even most of the local boba shops I've visited. All of the food came out incredibly quickly, and tasted incredible. The Chicken Feet especially was something I had been craving for a while, and wasn't able to find at local dim sum stalls. The Pork Belly had generous portions, and the food was more than enough to leave all of us feeling full. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to try the Bak Kut Teh, but I will definitely return here to try that next time.  I see why this restaurant holds a Michelin Guide recommendation for five years running--I will definitely be revisiting this place in the future."

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,22-Oct-18,"Damn, this place is the place to come for dinner.  We had: veggies, beancurd skin, pork belly, premium loin ribs soup, and rice.  The premium loin ribs soup was very very tasty. The soup was very well made and with lots of punch.The flavor was on the spot. I addition, the ribs were very tasty up to the bone.  The punch of the night was the pork belly. It had the proper combination of fat and skinny meat. The sauce made the dish even more tastier.  I gotta warn that this place gets pretty crowded and the wait line can take up to 1hr or more. So, be prepared for such long line and long wait time."

Needless to say, I want more. I had three bowls. Side dishes are bit salty. It also came with a bowl of rice.  It's stereotypical Singaporean. Small dishes and lots of soup.  I'm not complaining but the broth soup thing must be lost on westerners who did not grow up with soup.  The soup is almost white in color and they refill it from a kettle made for tea. Thus, the name translates into meat bone tea.  However, this thick broth is exactly the kind of thing Asians grew up on, especially southern (Cantonese) Chinese.  I would love to come back, but knowing my immediate family, which I put them under the white people category, this is not something they'd be up for.

I ordered the Ba Ku Teh, which at about $7 comes with 3 pork bones and soup. But as you are eating the bones and the soup, they come around and refill your bowl with more soup! The big benefit of that is that the soup always tastes super hot, because there's only so much soup at any given time, and every time you get more, the soup pipping hot, which keeps the experience super enjoyable.  The broth has a rich tasty pork taste, with a bit of pepper in it. It was a hearty, warm loving soup and I personally liked the amount of pepper, I thought it balanced the soup really well.  The Cai Lan was also pretty good, as well as the Lemon Tea. Overall a super enjoyable experience and one of my favorite meals in Singapore."

The soup can be tasteless at times though after a top up it can pack a punch of peppery goodness. It does not taste like it has been made with actual ribs, slow cooking for hours, lacking the natural sweetness and taste of home cooked soup.  As it is perennially crowded with tourists and locals, the staff is very efficient in seating customers and clearing tables. It really reminds me of the game ""Diner Dash"". I always feel like I am in the live version of it when eating here.  To shorten any potential time wasting, diners are expected to pay when the food arrive, just like in some coffee shops and hawker centers. So you can just leave once you are done with your meal.  The pork ribs is tender but not that tender that the meat can slid right off without some coaxing. The side dishes are ok.  I will only come here when I want sliced fish in bkt broth or if I am in the area. Otherwise, there are probably other better bkt around.  I believe this is a CASH only place."

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",4,15-Sep-15,"Across the street from the shops at Clarke Quay, the restaurant has two locations side by side. The corner location seemed way more crowded, so we hopped into the other side. We ordered up some water chestnut waters to hydrate and got to looking at the menu.  Beware of those wet naps! Those are NOT free and they will charge you $0.10 each. If you don't want miscellaneous charges, you just return the wet naps when you pay and they take it off your final bill. I wished I knew that tidbit in advance!  For food, we got the popular pork rib soup and a few other dishes, like cai xin (mustard greens), braised chicken feet and braised pork belly to share among the three of us.  The pork ribs were tender and fell off the bone, while the soup was heavy in white pepper. It wasn't too spicy since the heat level dissipated after a few seconds. It was so delicious.   The pork belly was super fatty, gelatinous and flavorful. The chicken feet for me was just comfort food. Both portions were relatively small, but tasty. The greens were there for balance haha.  Anyway, food is legit and service is very quick! Once the food arrives, you pay before you eat so you can bounce out when you're done."

Even though there are two of these almost right next to each other. Even though the waiting lines are always big, it doesnt take that long. The soup is a must try. Its peppery and clear. Rib is tender and you can get the soup refilled unlimited times. Side dishes like Bok Choy, Mustard, pork belly etc are tasty as well. Must try place!"

Price: the soup is expensive than the sides but just try for once it's ok 3. Taste: the soup tastes nice and you can ask them to have more soup for free

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",4,31-Mar-18,"Great broth!!! So the staple item to order is the original bone in broth combo, we ordered a few since we had a huge party. So the pork rib is very tender and absolutely amazing, it's flavorful and juicy. We ordered some vegetables for the table, bowl of rice and some other side dishes but honestly the pork rib soup the star of the entire place.  As you are eating your entire meal, be careful not eat all of the meat immediately because they will come around and REFILL your BROTH!! The broth is sooo friggin good, it is peppery and rich and just so amazing. Like I was able to enjoy rice with broth and it was so worth it. I'm not sure what their secret recipe is for the broth but you can tell they spend a lot of hours to make the broth.  They also sell packages of the broth seasoning in case you want to make it from home. Which i am a little upset that I did not buy. If you are visiting Singapore, it is definitely a must to just stop in for a bowl of pork rib broth.  Not necessary to order the other vegetables and side dishes, but definitely order a bowl of rice to go with the soup. Make sure to maximize the number of refills!! I was able to get three!!!"

Ordered the pork rib soup (which is what they're known for, especially if it's in the name of the restaurant) and they constantly refill the soup which is nice. It tastes heavily of white pepper but I love it, and the pork is so tender it falls off the bone. Definitely one of those restoring and revitalizing feeling soups.  Also got the braised pork belly which was good, but if you're sticking to a smaller breakfast, just go for the bak kut teh  Would definitely come back for another"

I like that Song Fa's Bak Kut Teh has no soy or black sauce added to their soup/broth. Strong and mostly white pepper flavor with subtle herbal essence.  Not cheap eats. Small bowl with small portion. Very little soup. When asked for soup refill, we didn't get it until the 3rd request. Soon after food was served, server asked for payment. And soon after payment was made, service disappeared along with condiments. Tactics to get people to leave? And not linger around?"

Let's just say this place will be a must visit from now on. The food is awesomely good, plentiful, and dirt cheap.

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",4,11-May-16,"Per recommendations and reviews, this was my first Bak Kut Teh here in Singapore. First off, It's nice that there is the corner restaurant and the one a few doors down. The corner one was busy so I went to the one that was indoors and was greeted by the person working the queue. It was still busy but lucky me it was less than 5 minutes wait since it was toward the end of lunch. Also, there was AC which was a nice break from the heat and while eating.  I ordered while I was waiting so the service was extra quick! I had a bowl of Bak Kut Teh and Kai Lan. The soup was good but I found it was quite peppery. The meat was flavorful, tender, and fell off the bone. I initially thought there wasn't enough soup but they come around and top up your bowl with hot soup after you've eaten a rib so there's more room; definitely a plus. Also, give it a try and taste the meat with the condiments provided.  Overall the service and people were nice, food came quickly, and it was flavorful and tender. Also the conscientious location is also a plus.  Tip1: Try to go during off peak hours so you have a shorter queue Tip2: I believe it is cash only so be sure you have some on you. You pay once you get your food at your table"

I really like it as it's very homey, like something my mom makes. The only downside is the price. A large bowl is $9 without rice or anything. Also, a cup of water is $0.30, so it's quite expensive. I mean, a plate of Hainanese chicken rice runs under $5 in Singapore, but here you literally get three pork ribs in a bowl of clear soup. But it's definitely tasty. Service was quick and friendly as well."

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",1,13-Feb-19,"I have never had such a bad experience at any place except for this one ! First of all, my 70-odd mother and eight-year-old son waited at the door for a long time. Finally, the shop boy asked us if we had ordered it. Do you have a number? We said we'd just given the menu, no number, and no one asked us to order, and he didn't care. He said, 'You can't do this! And then he just skip us and take the people in the back.' I hurried to ask another shop assistant in the queue, explaining the situation, we have a small family of three people will not be stuttering, cut in line / cheating! that the man was reasonable, after arranging the group of guests in his hands, we got to order food, and order number. When the food is ready, we'll order a small serving of bone tea and premium bone soup. The soup is too little, the shop originally has the service of free refill the soup, however we have to call three times, and to wait for a long time, and the attitude of the service staff is particularly unfriendly! I also asked the waiter if he had any tissue paper. A waiter replied in a very bad tone: The wipes are already on your desk!

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,1-Nov-13,"Bak Kut Teh = rich pork rib soup  Everything at Song Fa is pretty delicious, but their infamous bak kut teh is a must! I kid you not, but since coming back to the states, I still salivate over this peppery pork soup. mMm...it's simple, yet complexly delicious...and who can resist unlimited broth refills (yes, unlimited!) added to your bowl. Granted, when I was in SIN, it was super crazy hot and hard to put down hot liquids in my system, but I can only imagine how much more delicious this ""meat bone tea"" would taste during the cold winter months. The rich peppery taste can easily warm your stomach. In fact, with Winter fast approaching, it prompted me to write this review. I'm determined to find something comparable here in the states.  The meat from the pork ribs fell right off the bone and is best eaten with either a little bit of soy or a nice bowl of mee sua. I prefer noodles over rice, but I see others easily make rice soup with the brother and a nice bowl of rice. Craving something on the lighter side? There's also plenty of veggie options (beancurd skin, chinese broccoli, salted veggies) to complement the meat palate.  Keep in mind that Song Fa does get pretty crowded, no matter what time of the day and you are often asked to share a table if you come alone. With the constant amount of people, it can get pretty stuffy from time to time. However, service is super quick and they make every effort to get their patrons in and seated as quick as possible."

Food is served in 5 minutes or less and you pay when the food is served - no need to chase done the waitstaff to pay after your meal. I wish more places did this. 3. Simple, delicious food. The food tastes fresh, with simple clean flavors. A lot of food in SE Asia includes tons of spice, which can be overwhelming meal after meal. The flavors here are much more subtle, providing a nice change. Furthermore this is one of the few places I've found in Singapore where it's easy to eat low-carb/slow-carb, just go sans rice!  And the price is right! Large soup S$9, side of veggies S$4. Highly recommend!"

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",4,2-Oct-17,"Bak Kut Teh is one of those dishes that inspire a sense of heritage and at the same time could be a hot topic to debate over the style and where is the best. Now, I am not claiming to be an expert by any means, but Song Fa is producing a pretty impressive teocheow version that I would go back for more.  The flavors are simple: Pork ribs slowly cooked in a light pepper and garlic broth. Yet when you have the first sip of the broth, you realize you are having something far more complicated. The flavor is clean and to the point, yet the layers that develop make you keep sipping till you forget that there are pork ribs to enjoy. The pork was tender and at that point where it was still just about to fall of the bone, yet not quite pliable where it became difficult to eat. The side dish options are pretty respectable and give that nice balance of flavor that you end up craving.  Service was quick and efficient. As you wait in the line, be prepared to order, because the your dishes will arrive as soon as your butt hits the chair/stool. There is an efficiency to their process and you will be quick to enjoy your dishes, while helping them keep their line moving.  Definitely would go back! It's quick service, nice location, and pretty impressive dishes make me a fan."

The pork was tender and at that point where it was still just about to fall of the bone, yet not quite pliable where it became difficult to eat. The side dish options are pretty respectable and give that nice balance of flavor that you end up craving.  Service was quick and efficient. As you wait in the line, be prepared to order, because the your dishes will arrive as soon as your butt hits the chair/stool. There is an efficiency to their process and you will be quick to enjoy your dishes, while helping them keep their line moving.  Definitely would go back! It's quick service, nice location, and pretty impressive dishes make me a fan."
Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,16-Sep-18,"Made a trip out to this restaurant during my stay in Singapore and I'm so glad I did! The food (specifically the bak kut teh) reminded me of home and it really hit the spot. The meat is SO TENDER and literally falls off the bone. We got 2 large ones + other dishes to share amongst 3 people and it was just the right amount of food; however, we all agreed that we each could've finished our own bak kut teh. I recommend one per person (they have both regular and large.. large = more meat) If I ever go back to Singapore, I'll definitely visit Song Fa again!"

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",4,31-Mar-15,"Song Fa = Solid  I can't believe it took me so long to get to this famous bak kut teh spot! This Clarke Quay location always has a queue, but when we visited over the weekend it wasn't too bad.  As they were out of the premium long ribs, we settled for the regular pork rib soup. At my first sip of soup, I could tell right away that it was flavourful, but not as peppery as Founder's on Balestier. I still prefer Founder's broth, but don't get me wrong- Song Fa's is still very, very good.  For me, a lot of bak kut teh places fall flat when it comes to the quality of the pork meat. Sometimes it's dry and tough, which puts a damper on the dish. However, Song Fa passes this test with flying colours- I was amazed at how juicy and tender their pork meat was. How did they do it?! I guess that's their secret. In my opinion, this is where they're better than Founder's.  I only deduct one star because I wasn't too much a fan of their you tiao. I found it slightly greasy and not very fluffy. It took me a while to really chew it 'til it got soft enough. But overall, I understand why people flock here. It's location is tourist friendly, the prices are good, and the al fresco vibe really gives you a local Singaporean experience!"

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,2-Jul-15,"Bak kut teh -A Singaporean classic that is a must try. The fall off the bone pork rib is happily swimming in a tasty broth of classic Chinese spice. Hard to describe, divinely flavored. Looks like Philippine sinigang but tastes uniquely all its own. Order the fried donuts to soak up the broth and you will be properly sorted.  During peak hours of lunch and dinner be ready to wait, but trust me... its well worth it."

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",4,7-Jun-18,"Lol this is the asian version of ribs. Instead of BBQ grill and char, that is drenched in sauce -- here you can have boiled ribs in a savory soup. Meat so tender and flavorful! The soup, it's super thin (like most Asian soup) and so good!  For the two of us we ordered: One order of ribs One veggie dish One pork belly side One bowl of rice One small order or fried dough  Meal was more than enough to feed us both, and very tasty  Service was quick. Food came out quick too. Once all the food arrived to table, they bring the check over. When you are ready to pay, walk up the bill to cashier"

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,23-Jul-18,Popular bak kut teh (peppery pork rib soup) restaurant in SG with several branches throughout the city. This restaurant lives up to its hype - the Bak kut teh has a strong pepper taste/smell which is a big plus for me and the pork ribs are tender. We also like the stewed pork belly which was (guiltily) satisfying. The sides of braised tofu and preserved vegetable were also good. Portions were quite sizable (3 meaty ribs per bowl). Vibe a bit hectic / busy but if you are ok with that then this is def a good spot to check out / bring out of town guests to.

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",3,3-Apr-17,"I was told this place is the original Song Fa Bak Kut Teh in Singapore and lines are usually pretty long for lunch and dinner. Can go up to an hour wait. So my girlfriend decided this was something I had to have during my visit.  I don't recall what my husband ordered. He had the spare rib soup that was boneless and said it tasted pretty regular. My girlfriend ordered the fish which was surprisingly good. Not too fishy but the soup is pretty neutral. I had their signature dish.. the black-peppered spare rib soup. Its definitely different from what I've had before. Good but not wowed by it. I'm not sure if this is a local favorite dish but it feels like this is something neutral for tourists like me. Not too heavy and not super bland. Just the perfect balance in flavor to give you that savory taste. But I wasn't wowed by this place in all honesty. It wasn't something out of the ordinary and something quite simple to make at home. I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends who wanted to visit Singapore... unless they want to eat on the safe side.. this is probably closest to safe without being too salty, too sweet.. too strong or too overwhelming."

I ordered a small, which was indeed quite small... but it alright, I probably won't be able to finish a larger one anyway.  I know there are people who swear by it but for the others out there, you are not alone. Perhaps you are just like me who prefer the stronger tasting Malay style BKT. :P"

Thankfully, my friends went early to queue and we got a table by the time I arrived.  Service here is pretty fast, and you pay on the spot when food is served. I ordered the pork rib with pig stomach combo, which was decent. The pork rib was soft and the soup was peppery. We also ordered kai lan, salted vegetable, and marinated pig intestine to share. I love the pig intestine. Decently cleaned and marinated well - not too salty.  I also appreciate how they come around and offer soup refills :) Definitely recommended for a night bak kut teh hunt near Clark Quay!"

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",4,30-Apr-14,"There are two Songfa Bak Kut Teh locations within 30 feet of one another. The one facing New Bridge Road is indoors. The other wrapping around the street is outdoors. Considering the humidity of Singapore, I opted for the indoor Songfa with rotating fans.  There weren't many customers since it was past peak hours of lunch. However at 2:30 pm--during the first half hour into my dine--couples, groups of friends and a crew of middle-aged men trickled in. 80% of the restaurant was occupied. Half an hour later they stealthily left as they had come.  The interior contained black-and-white photos of Clark Quay and color photos of their dishes. With questions sprouting in my mind regarding the food and its history, I inquired the waitresses. They didn't speak much English so it was up to my imagination and Google to answer my curiosities.  I ordered a small bowl of Pork Ribs Soup, also known as ""bak kut teh"" and ""meat bone soup."" The soup had a strong presence of black pepper. The soft garlic cloves dissolved as you gently squeezed the meat out of them. Some of the pork ribs were soft. Others had a slightly dry texture even when rehydrated in the soup. If you run low on hot soup, ask a server for free refills.  Usually Bak Kut Teh is paired with rice or noodles. Instead I consumed it with a small plate of Choi Sum topped off with garlic chips. The vegetables were seasoned just enough to have flavor, but not so much that it would take away attention from the soup.  Each table has a pot and mini sink. You boil your own cup of tea. As for me I drank their Homemade Water Chestnut, which can be ordered cold or warm. It tasted medicinal with a slight sweetness.  My bill totaled to $11.80 SGD ($9.39 USD). And yes, they charged 20 cents for the wet tissue. Dear Singapore, what do you have against dry napkins?  PS: The tiny bathrooms here should be illegal. Consider using the toilet before eating. Eat first, then go? Good luck! Every inch counts. The men and women's bathroom should be combined. Aside from lavatory woes, I'd come back for more Songfa Bak Kut Teh."

They have braised pork as well. Choose from pork ribs, trotters, organs (liver, kidney, intestines, etc)."

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",4,27-Apr-14,"I've never had Bak Kut Teh before, so my Singaporean friends of course wanted to drag me here! We came on a Wednesday night with a party of 6. I heard the line would be quite long so I actually got there like 5-10 minutes before the rest of my friends got there, and even though it was fairly busy, I managed to snag a table quite quickly, albeit right next to the door. I guess I'm pretty lucky!  Anyways, given that I was new to the entire thing, I had my Singaporean friends make recommendations on what to order.  I myself got a large bowl of pork ribs, lime juice, a bowl of rice, and a pork trotter dish to share. I didn't actually know what trotter was, and when I found out that trotter = feet, I was like.. oh that's obvious. My friends said it was good so we got an order.  You get like 3 ribs with the large order. The ribs themselves are very soft and tender, bit lightly flavored as a lot of the flavor has gone into the soup, but it was very good and what I expected.  The broth is great! It's rich, warm, and delicious!  I loved the lime juice too! I should get more lime juice drinks in the future... as long as the Mexican lime crisis concludes.  The trotter was decent. Perhaps not really to my taste though, maybe I didn't like the texture.  All in all, it came out to be like 12-ish a person. Awesome price for delicious food.  Would totally come back next time I'm in Singapore. Hooray for Singaporean food!"

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",2,19-Dec-17,Founder of Song Fa BKT Yeo Eng Song started serving bak kut teh from a pushcart stall in 1969. Nowadays Song Fa no longer operate from a pushcart but promise the same original fall-off-the-bone tender pork ribs experience. Sadly what we had was far from that. Our premium loin ribs looked impressive but the meat was super tough and dry. The standard ribs were surprisingly much softer and flavoursome. The soup was not overwhelmingly peppery but just enough to make you sweat. Not the best bkt place we've been to unfortunately and there's nothing that would entice us to come back anytime soon.

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,4-Feb-13,"Throughout my years of living in the Lion City of Singapore, there are a few foods that seem to make virtually every ""Top 10 Foods of Singapore"" List. One of those dishes is ""Bak Kut Teh"" or ""Pork Rib Soup"" and our favorite place to eat this delectable goodness is SONGFA BAK KUT TEH.  According to the SONGFA website: Bak Kut Teh is a Chinese soup popularly served in Singapore. The name literally translates as ""meat bone tea"", and, at its simplest, consists of meaty pork ribs in a complex broth of herbs and spices boiled together with pork bones for hours. Bak kut teh was introduced to Malaya in the 19th century by Chinese workers from Canton, Chaoshan and Fujian. So what does this mean to the average joe like you or I? Not too much, other than to know that this is a historically simple and good dish that has been served on this side of the planet for eons and it's damn good.  SONGFA is always crowded and they move people through quickly, think of it as local fast food. The menu is filled with a lot of local delicacies that may be a bit tough for an untested Western palette (like Pig Organ Soup or braised Chicken Feet) but if I may be so bold order this: Pork Ribs Soup, Dough Fritters & Kai Lan, you won't be disappointed. And the best part? The broth is bottomless, so the goodness will keep on going.  I know it might seem odd to get excited about soup in the warm & muggy climate of Singapore but the flavors make up for it, this is home cooking at its local fast food finest. So if you are near the Quays and looking for something quick, cheap and filling, I heartily recommend SONGFA BAK KUT TEH, the goodness will not disappoint!"

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",4,29-Jul-16,"My favorite meal in Singapore. Get the pork rib soup. You HAVE to get that. Do not get the premium pork loin soup... it's just not as tasty in my opinion. Skip the pork belly unless you want super fatty chunks with not a lot of meat (maybe it's meant to be eaten like that... I don't know). The broth in the pork rib soup is really something special. Okay, I'm a tourist so I don't know how it's supposed to taste or how genuine it is but I do travel a lot and I have never tasted anything quite like this. The broth is perfectly salted and it has an herby smokey flavor, very satisfying. I liken it to a tea based broth. In my opinion it was pretty inexpensive given it's in Clarke Quay. $9 for a large bowl, approx. $6.85 US dollars.  Overall, its a great place for a tourist like me to get a taste of the local cuisine. I felt like I was transported to another time and place. A time when Singapore was more simple and less of a global smart city (which I think is pretty damn great fyi)."

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",3,9-Jan-13,Lunch time is sooo crowded! Be sure to go early to avoid the lines. I reckon the queue has more to do with Singaporean's obsession with the dish more than anything. Most Bakuteh joints in Singapore are pretty decent. It's a national staple.  1. The pork broth was great. They could be a bit more generous with the pork ribs though.  2. You tiao - is cold and soggy. Do not order. Unless you intend only to dip it in the soup (commonly eaten this way in Singapore) then its lack of crispiness is tolerable.  3. Would not recommend ordering the Pig's throttles in black sauce - too much pig skin and fats. Very little meat.  Price range - 10 per pax.

They even have a sign out front where they update how long the wait is for a table.  I love the interior decor. Makes it feel homey, even though the tables are pretty close to each other. The tables along the walls have their own sinks and heated tea pots for those who want hot tea.  The must order of course is their Pork ribs bak kut teh. The ribs are fall off the bone tender, and the soup is full of garlic and peppery goodness. Get an order of noodles to eat with this soup! And if you run low on soup, they give free refills on soup!  Their braised chicken feet with beancurd is also very good. The chicken feet are braised very soft, and the flavors are spot on!  They even sell soup packets for you to make your own bak kut teh at home, just need to add garlic and ribs!  Its about 2 blocks away from the Clarke Quay subway station, so super convenient."

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,25-Nov-17,Bak kut teh (pork rib soup)- initially used chili sauce to dip into but the meat really doesn't need any enhancement and the chili sauce proved to be a distraction. The broth is peppery and you can taste the bone marrow and meat from hours of boiling. Unlimited refills on the broth and I made sure to get as many refills as possible. I got noodles with my broth but you can get rice. I felt afterwards my flu being sweated out.  Honey lemon barley ice tea- initially skeptical about the combination but proved to be a winner. Great way to cool off after the meal.

So my local partners in crime got us a reservation at this hip and happening place for pork rib soup. Once seated we ordered the namesake dish, some veggies and fried dough. It came out rather fast, was piping hot and looked delicious.  And the soup was delicious in a simple home cooked way. The pork bones were meaty, tender, and my guide pointed out that there were 2 grades of pork rib bones but looked similar to me. I noticed there was a lot of white pepper used to flavor the broth.  So who woulda thought the simple clear soup mom has been making for the last 40 years was a close version of the Bak Kut Teh... Now that I've came, saw, and experienced, I know how to glam up mom's brew!"

Chinese mushroom or fish soup, tomato with pork bones Hong Kong style, and Japanese Ramen base nail me. And Bak Kut Teh appears among my second ring for soup preferences.  The ones we have in HK tends to be heavy in herbs. It always tastes rather bitter with a chinese medicine smell...And served in those brown clay pot. Which totally make a medi dish. :( But the soup remains sweet, salty and fresh. I know this sounds wired, but it is one of the best pork bone dish.  Okay, let us talk about the authenticity here in S'pore. Pure soup, pure pork bone soup. With herbs, seafood, some grandma's soup. Not those 10+ hour Canto style. Very simple homemade soup.

Chinese mushroom or fish soup, tomato with pork bones Hong Kong style, and Japanese Ramen base nail me. And Bak Kut Teh appears among my second ring for soup preferences.  The ones we have in HK tends to be heavy in herbs. It always tastes rather bitter with a chinese medicine smell...And served in those brown clay pot. Which totally make a medi dish. :( But the soup remains sweet, salty and fresh. I know this sounds wired, but it is one of the best pork bone dish.  Okay, let us talk about the authenticity here in S'pore. Pure soup, pure pork bone soup. With herbs, seafood, some grandma's soup. Not those 10+ hour Canto style. Very simple homemade soup.

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",4,9-Dec-12,"I like the ambience of the place. The table I sat on has a tap beside me and that really served me well in cleaning the cups etc. I haven't had the authentic feel of enjoying a bak kut teh with tea cups and boiler for such a long time. Most places serve their tea in plastic cups.  The meat is tender and neither too hard nor too soft. The service is pretty alright and average. What else... I think if you would like an above average bak kut teh with a reasonable comfortable ambience which is not too expensive and yet located in a very centralised place (its just opposite The Central), the question you have to ask yourself is ""why not?"""

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,22-Aug-12,"On cold nights or rainy days, i often find myself craving for hot peppery soup and that's when i'll head down to Song Fa Ba Kut Teh to warm up my shivering tummy.  My favorite bkt is the clear soup (otherwise called white soup) which is packed with lotsa black and white pepper. Not a fan of the black herbal sort (too much herbs for me).  Verdict? The soup is not bad, savory enough and is very aromatic. The meat is so tender, it peels off the bone with a light tug of your teeth. The ribs absorbs the flavor of the soup so thoroughly you don't even have to dip it in too much dark sauce to give it the extra flavor. I have tried both the premium and the regular ribs here and the regular ones are much better. Trust me on this one. The regular rib is better than Founder's premium ribs as well. For $8 you would get the large bowl and that's about 6 ribs. On good days i can finish that by myself.  If you want more food, other dishes such as the braised intestines (really well marinated and clean), pork trotters (braised and melt-in-your-mouth meat!), chicken feet (i don't eat this) etc are pretty awesome too. If you like variety, you could go for the mixed soup of your choice- you could choose ribs, stomach, tail bone etc in the pork bone soup. Me? I'd just go for the regular pork rib bkt. :)  There are 2 outlets along New Bridge Road, i always go to the air conditioned one. It's from the same kitchen and the prices are the same so why not dine in comfort right?"

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",3,16-Apr-14,"As delicious as bak kut teh is with all the spices and pepper, this was only mediocre compared to other places I've had it in Singapore. Unlike reviews of others, there was absolutely no line-up and in fact, tons of empty tables when I came by on a Thursday night. However, the bak kut teh was the only soup left available so I didn't get the chance to try any of the other...8 soups they had on the menu?  I do love the amount of pepper, I do love the tender pieces of pork, I do love the continuous broth refill. The parts that were missing for me are the melt in your mouth cloves of garlic that usually come in it...such a key ingredient!!! I also enjoy the versions that have some cilantro to top it off.  We also tried the marinated pig intestines and although decent flavour, it wasn't up to par in terms of texture. A bit broken down and didn't have the chew that I desire when I eat innards."

Okay, fine, let's go  Thirty minutes of waiting in line later, we are seated on barely stable plastic chairs that essentially on the street. I don't say this disparagingly, some of the truly best food is at places that don't waste their time, energy, and money on needless pretensions.  Our group ordered almost one of everything on the menu. The famed ribs and the soup it came in was disappointingly average, the meat tasted like most of the flavor was boiled out of it. I guess the soup benefitted from that, and you can get unlimited soup refills. The thing is, everyone loves that this soup is peppery, but it's so peppery that the other flavors are overwhelmed. It just seems counter-productive that they went through a hard-core famous cooking process to make great quality broth then mask it."

The joint itself looks like an ungraded version of the usual coffee shop stalls - with air conditioning and occupying up to 2 units at the corner of the building.  They serve the usual soup with generous helpings of succulent meat with the delicious 'boiled-all-day' taste that our grannies used to make for us, and soups are refillable! It's a nice homey touch to a modern day looking restaurant that adds a dash of nostalgia of the olden days. The soup is not too peppery and still thick enough with both spices and meat, so it's actually possible for young kids to mix it with plain rice for a meal without any additional seasoning.  Their side dishes are also yummy like pork innards if you find that acceptable, and honestly locals have no qualms since it's considered as quite the delicacy and 'good for our health' somehow."

I don't like the dish that much so it's hard for me to say. I can tell you that I found the ribs to be of average quality, the meat just didn't fall off the bone the way it should have. Having said that, I was pleasantly surprised by the tenderloin pork. I'm pretty lazy so having my pork chopped up in bite-size chunks versus needing to gnaw at big bits of bone was kind of nice.  I also like how they keep refilling the soup. It would be even better if it was the herby Klang soup but, no matter. Warm soup is always a pleasure.

Whilst staying in Clarke Quay area, I randomly stumbled upon this restaurant on one of my walks around town. Having been told that Bak Kut Teh is supposed to be the Singaporean dish to be tried, I figured it wouldn't hurt to give it a go.  I ordered one order of BKT, one order of pork knuckle and one order of steamed rice. Everything was brought out lightning quick, which was perfect since I was seriously starved. Oh, i should mention that smaller the group the quicker you get seated in between customers - me having gone solo I was given a seat almost instantly.  Food was excellent - although I cannot compare the BKT to any other place as I did not have the time to go check out other places. I will say though one of my favourite meals in Singapore was this!"

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",3,17-Aug-12,"My favorite Bak Kut Teh is the clear soup (otherwise called white soup) which is packed with lots of black and white pepper. Not a fan of the black herbal sort (too much herbs for me). The you tiao wasn't that crispy because I guessed it was pre-fried, but it didn't really matter because we were drowning it in the soup anyway. The soft dough with all the soup absorbed is just plain happiness.  This is the new store that opened near the old stall. It actually looks more clean and spacious compared to the old shop front. But it somehow lacks the old feel, like this one feels more commercialized and less authentic. But the favorite Bak Kut Teh is still nice.  It is located conveniently near Clarke quay mrt station. Once you step out at the burger king side you can see it opposite the road. One of the better favorite Bak Kut Teh i have tried so far."

My husband and I were suppose to have dinner at another place but that place was closed but I had this place booked mark. We walked from our hotel to this place which was about a little over a mile. When we arrived there was no line but the place was 95% full. They don't have a very extensive menu because they specialize in pork rib soup. We both got a bowl of soup, a bowl of rice and the husband order pig intestines. We both ordered drinks too. We were both hot from the walk. The soups came out fairly quick and the intestines. Our drinks came out soon after. The soup was amazing even when it was hot out! The pork falls right off the bone and they give you fresh red chili and you add your own soy sauce. The intestine were really good too. They were braised in a sweet soy sauce. Our drinks were good too. We ordered a barley and 2 lime juices. I think lime juice is Singapores version of lemonade. Our meal was super cheap. Before we left Singapore we made another stop for more soup and this time I learned you can ask for more soup broth! We bought the soup packets to bring home to recreate the soup. I hope it will taste just like it!"

Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",3,2-Jan-18,"Located in an old shopping centre which has seen its glory days, the nondescript stall is in a food court and from the queue, it's a sure sign of good food as Singaporeans will do anything for food.  Tried the steam chicken and roast chicken. Both were tender and flavourful. Added plus is the freshly made archa which had the right blend of sweet, sour and spiciness.  At $32 for a whole bird, the price is reasonable"
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,31-Jul-18,"I went twice. The first time I had steamed chicken the second time roast which I found richer and tastier, though I enjoyed both. I actually came back for the salad, fruit and veg is expensive to buy in small quantities in Singapore (except bananas) and I was craving something crunchy. If you order chicken and rice you also get a bowl of soup (cabbage? Pork ribs? Mild but tasty and nourishing). All up $5 which I found good value. The guy was quietly amused when I didn't take the chilli sauce the first time so I did take it the second time"
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,27-Feb-15,"Ohhhhhohohoho.  Thanks to Charles Ryan T., I believe I just experienced one of the more underrated chicken rice spots on the island.  Walking into the basement food centre of Katong Shopping Centre was like taking a step back in time to decades ago Singapore. I didn't notice any renovations, and I hope they keep it that way. I also noticed there were no ang mos here. I wonder why that is. (I'm serious!)  I came in about an hour before closing and the queue was very short. I asked the uncle for one boneless chicken rice.* While preparing my meal, he asked I where I was from.  Me: I'm from US. Uncle: Upper Serangoon? Me: *Confused* Uncle: In Singapore, US means Upper Serangoon. Me: Ahhhhhh I see what you did there!  Funny uncle! :) Once my food was served, I noticed some differences:  1) My chicken actually had chillis on it, which made it a slightly spicier chicken rice. 2) The soup was very different- unlike the usual chicken stock, this time it was beef based, with sliced potatoes. It might change every day because when I look at the Yelp photos, it appears to be different in each one. 3) There is a huge bowl of pickled salad, which is self-serve and free flow. The salad had cucumber, jalapenos, pineapples, and red onions. 4) Also, while waiting, I noticed the uncle would spritz a few orders with a mystery liquid. Not sure what it was, but really interesting practice!  For $4.80, I was floored at how unique and truly delicious their boneless chicken rice was. However, I found mine a bit dry- but dousing it in the beef based soup made it even better. And of course, I experienced this when my phone was dead so I have no photos to show. This just means I'll have to return and experience the glory all over again!  -- *There is a sign on the stall that says you must tell them if you want the chicken boneless."
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,28-Feb-15,"Thanks Charles T. for an Amazing Chicken Rice recommendation. Who knew there was a gem of a chicken rice place at the basement of Katong Shopping Centre! This chicken rice was different than the ones usually found on the Red Dot. This was a MAN's chicken rice. The flavours for what usually is a bland dish was just incredible. Garlic, spring onions, and the Chillis! Oh man, the Chillis. It really gives this baby a kick!  I also got side of soup, which reminded me of, what my mom used to cook back home. Not necessarily good, because it's filled with cabbages and other veggie blandness. Hehe. The rice was not anything special.  Definitely, my favorite chicken rice place in Katong. Will likely be my new go to place for chicken rice, if I have a serious craving!"
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,17-Jun-14,"One of the top chicken rice places in Singapore. Tender and juicy chicken that makes you want more, comes with spicy chilli and a bowl of delicious rice that goes well with it. A bowl of spicy soup comes along with the set and the portion is definitely worth the money.  I always avoid the lunch and dinner hours as the queue can get very long. Located at a coffee shop style food court at the basement 1 level of Katong Shopping Mall, there are limited seats, so if you are going with someone, remember to get a seat."
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,24-Jul-12,"As a vegetarian, I'm sure most people wouldn't (and rightfully shouldn't) take my chicken rice reviews too seriously. But that's just how good it is. I'm going against my vegan ways to tell everyone about how awesome this chicken rice is.  There's been a long and ongoing debate, especially in the Katong area, about the best chicken rice in Singapore. Some go for Boon Tong Kee, others support 5-star and then there's Tian Tian Chicken Rice; all of these can be found withing a 1 to 200 metre radius from Katong Shopping Centre's basement. But this is the one you don't know about that you need to go to.  What most people generally agree is important for chicken rice is 1. The rice 2. The chilli and then the chicken comes in 3rd, almost like an afterthought. This place has the sort of rice you could eat plain and be perfectly content with, chilli that makes your mouth burst (with flavour, not hotness) and chilli soaked with soy sauce, garlic, and who knows what other sorcery is in there.  Mainly, the garlic. You can see it, you can taste it, and you'll always want more of it. I never have meat cravings, but when I see this stall, I admit. I've been tempted a couple of times before. Try it, and enjoy it, and do it on my behalf.  The underdog always wins, in this case. No need for chain stores or a good marketing plan. Just damn good chicken rice."
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,20-Sep-15,"Oh man, I LOVED this place. After researching local foods while visiting Singapore, I quickly learned that chicken rice was a must, but there were so many options it was hard to choose. Honestly, I couldn't tell you what made me choose this place but i'm glad I went. The chicken was perfectly cooked, the gingery-chili sauce that accompanied it was delicious and the pickled fruits and veggies on the side absolutely made the meal. I can't stop thinking about this place and wish I could go back right now.  As a note, this place isn't fancy. It's on the basement level of the the Katong Shopping Center and you simply walk up, order and take your food to a table. But who needs fancy when your food tastes like heaven in your mouth?"
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,10-Jun-16,"Amazing place. For all the chicken and dishes, it's affordable and the food is good. They offer free soups and achar which is a good compliment to the chicken rice. A gem in the east. Just have to endure the wait :)"
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,19-Mar-15,"Having worked in IP and trademarks, I can say that this joint at Katong SC doesn't have the best and most distinctive brand name. What I can say however, is that the Chicken rice served here is, as it's name states, absolutely delicious. The gamers at the nearby LAN shop call will call their specialty wicked sick. I have been patronizing this place since 2003 and the consistency in the chicken hasn't changed much over the years.  I came with a friend who just got back from the States for holiday and he was kind of missing this local fare. He claims he's able to make real Hainanese chicken over there - dousing the hot cooked chicken in cold water so that the fat layer stays on the meat and serving it with a nasty chili concoction. However, no hesitation at all when I mentioned KSC basement's Chicken rice.  We ordered half a chicken (white) opting for a serving of achar (onions, pineapples, etc.) and a bowl of chicken soup. The rice was tasty but I thought it was better years ago. Still fragrant though. The chili was not too bad. My friend went back three times to take additional servings of it.  Great to see them proud of their endorsement by yelp. Hope to see more of my favorite businesses do the same.  Oh anyway, the chicken rice at marine parade hawker center nearby is pretty good too."
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,8-Aug-12,"As the name suggests, Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice.  Delicious: spot on.  Boneless: spot on.  They top it off with crispy fried garlic which just takes the chicken rice to a whole new level. Even better, they serve the chicken rice with a bowl of pretty awesome soup, cooked with corn and carrots and a whole lot of other things. Its great when you have soup thats anything other than plain old chicken stock with chopped spring onion.  Go get your chicken rice today!"

(Order for one less than the number in your party to leave space for roast meat, vegetables, chicken feet, etc.) We love the free flow of achar and going back for second helping of soup. Even the chili here is among the best I've tasted."
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,16-Feb-18,Chicken and rice is very flavourful with their unique achar that adds an interesting flavour. There has been a queue of about 20-30 Mins wait every time I have been there. But this rating is for the food and not the wait. So if you're in a hurry this is not a good option - but if you have the time for some tasty chicken rice...this is clucking good!
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,24-Aug-12,"One of the better chicken rice in the area, what makes this one stand out is that when you eat there, you get a choice of really good soups, not the usual chicken-stock flavour crap you sometimes get - you can either get the veggie soup or the one with corn, carrots and pork ribs. Also, free achar, how awesome!  The rice of the chicken rice is oddly yellow, still tasted good. The roasted chicken is good with crispy skin. I recommend eating here in a group so you can order to your heart's content. On top of steamed and roast chicken and the free soups, my group also had chicken feet (they take away the feet for you so its more convenient to eat), beansprouts and liver... super filling meal!"
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,2-Sep-12,"The first time I was introduced to this Chicken Rice, my friends told me that this store gives a lot of freebies and the chicken rice was not at exorbitant pricing. 'Freebies' include achar, shredded carrot and radish and soup of the day (double boiled soup). In the past, sometimes they give ice cream too. But, haven't had that for a while.  I didn't believe it until i try for myself. Yes. this place is great. The ""freebies"" don't just apply for dine in, for takeaway too."
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,19-Oct-15,For me its the best chicken rice! Actually found it affordable for what my wife and I ordered and what came with it- for her chicken rice with breast meat with a complimentary large bowl of herbal soup and me drumstick with large cabbage soup. Plus Newspapers n salted fish... $14.50. I've paid more elsewhere and the chicken wasn't as succulent or tasty or the rice as fragrant our heavenly. The soup could be a meal in itself. Fantastic
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",3,29-Jul-12,"The draw of the chicken rice here comes from the soup which comes with every serving. This isn't the usual lousy MSG broth that some places give. I is a proper ABC soup, with potatoes, carrots and pork. The chicken and the chili are also very good. Tender with a very tasty sauce that comes with it. azhar and kiam chye is also part of the deal as you can take as much as you want if you eat in.  The only reason why I am not giving a higher rating is the rice, of which im not that big a fan. It comes it this strange yellowish color, and is not very fragrant, which goes in direct contradiction with the previous review. So I'm guessing that it works for some and not for others. But it does tick all the other boxes when it comes to good chicken rice."
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,13-Aug-12,"This is the chicken rice stall that I would often visit whenever I go Teoheng for Karaoke! Pardon them for the rather cheesy name, but seriously, the chicken is as good as it can get! The chicken sold here is really smooth and tender, rice very yummy too. What's more, there's nice soup to go along with it! That really makes them stand out from the rest of the chicken rice stalls as many serve you tasteless chicken stock soup loaded with pepper. If you finish up your soup, you can kindly ask for refill too! Remember to get the garlic chili and dark soya sauce to go along with your chicken rice! Simply delicious!"
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,30-Aug-12,"It must have been years since I last visited Katong Shopping Centre, and when I did I had to try what is arguably one of the top few chicken rice stalls in Singapore. The price of the chicken rice here is slightly above average but the queue is still very long, so there must be something that they're doing right. Anyway, I managed to get my chicken rice after a bit of queuing, and suffice to say that I was indeed blown away by the chicken rice here. The rice here is really smooth and fragrant, and the chicken is oh so tender. I ordered the roast chicken and the skin was very flavorful. Another thing was that the serving size here also seemed to be larger than at other places (in terms of the quantity of meat and the rice), so perhaps this is to compensate for their slightly higher prices. The chili complemented the chicken perfectly as well. Overall, I would definitely rate the chicken rice here among the top 5 in Singapore."
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,22-Jul-16,"The chicken rice here is delicious and affordable, but be prepared to wait in line. Food court itself is kinda dirty looking though."
Delicious Boneless Chicken Rice,4.5,21,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,15-Jan-15,One of the best chicken rice in town and they serve the best complimentary soup to go with your chicken rice. Nice pickles too. The garlic toppings on the chicken enhance the place of chicken unless you don't like garlic. The best part is the sauce soak cucumber at the bottom of the chicken.

The Garden Grille,5,1,"International, Breakfast & Brunch",5,19-Aug-19,"Well.... Where to begin? It's fairly nice as far as sit down dining goes for this area. We have 5 nights with breakfast buffet included ... However we have stayed here a dozen plus times in the past 2 years... So we are quite familiar with the digs n dining here.  No... We were not out here for any business or family. Rather, we decided to take a ""mileage run"" for frequent flier ""lifetime total mileage"" because 1st) we noted Asaian airfares from LAX seemed much lower than usual... IE $380 total r/t to SIN... $500 to Narita. So we stood at about 770,000 lifetime miles thus needed 230,000 for the magic million total. So being cheapest and furthest we flew about 10x last year + other destination afar.  Back to the Hilton Garden Grill... It's great and gets 5 stars because service is above and beyond...  I'd like to have seen a wider and deeper selection of cuisine. Larger spaces and crowds would have supported that perhaps... But then again its just a hilton Garden Inn.

My partner and I have been eating here for a few years now. They make the best noodles probably the best I've had.
Newton Tian Xiang Big Prawn Noodle,4.5,2,Noodles,4,6-Sep-16,"I've been here since the longest...probably 20yrs back... The prawn soup base has been the same sweet taste since. You can order prawns de-shelled with slice pork or pork ribs....both are as good. Remember to add the chilli powder for extra kick in the soup. It's only $5 plus onwards for their selection. Every once in a while, I will crave for the sweetness prawns soup which really yummy to the taste. Enjoy."
Earlybird,4.5,11,"Cafes, Breakfast & Brunch",5,31-Mar-24,"""Absolutely stellar breakfast experience! From the moment we walked in, the warm ambiance and friendly staff set the tone for an exceptional meal. The menu offers a delightful array of options, from classic favorites to inventive twists on breakfast classics. Each dish we tried was expertly prepared, bursting with flavor and presented beautifully. The attention to detail and quality of ingredients truly shine through in every bite. Whether you're a local or just passing through, this breakfast spot is an absolute must-visit. Five stars all the way!"""
Earlybird,4.5,11,"Cafes, Breakfast & Brunch",5,9-Nov-22,"This is a really cute bird themed breakfast spot slightly hidden away in an unassuming neighborhood. A lot of tourists go to Hawkers, Malls, and high traffic tourism destinations. However, I urge anyone in the area craving American style breakfasts to drop by here.  They make an American Breakfast better than you can get in America pretty easily.  Service is simple but quick. You just order at the front and they will bring the food to your table. Water is already available at the tables, and you'll be provided everything you need to eat when you order your dishes.  All their menu items have a slight twist to it that makes it unique, be it a little chili in the maple or an Asian sauce on pasta, but it's executed very well.  For example the Pancakes may be among the best pancakes I've ever had. Similar to New York's famous Clinton Street Baking Co., but since their only location in Singapore closed down, this is probably the best in the country.  You've got a delicious buttery crust, fluffy light center, not greasy, just slightly sweet pairing with a savory juicy fried chicken thigh. Utter perfection on a classic combination.  If you're not watching your diet and want some comfort food with a twist, come on by! Seating for large parties is limited, but definitely something I'd recommend with a small group of friends!"
Earlybird,4.5,11,"Cafes, Breakfast & Brunch",5,3-Aug-22,Came here after reading reviews on yelp and just wanting a way to Kick start my day with some brekkie. Seemed like a cool place and was pretty local to my hotel so gave it a go. Greeted by person at counter and ordered a truffle mushroom croissant and egg. Food portions were on level with what you get in US and cappuccino was solid. Service was nice and have to say its worth a stop if you re looking for a nice waybto jumpstart your morning. Ambiance was cool and pretty chill. Would recommend if you re in the area...
Earlybird,4.5,11,"Cafes, Breakfast & Brunch",5,9-May-24,Great breakfast spot. Very creative food dishes. Would recommend this little spot. Service was good.
Earlybird,4.5,11,"Cafes, Breakfast & Brunch",5,14-Oct-22,Very delicious and flavorful food. The drinks are delicious and pretty as well. Such a. Cute place.
Earlybird,4.5,11,"Cafes, Breakfast & Brunch",5,14-Feb-23,Good place for breakfast in Singapore close to Kampong Glam and Jalen basser. Coffee is good and reasonably priced
Earlybird,4.5,11,"Cafes, Breakfast & Brunch",4,5-Jan-23,"Nice place for a low key breakfast. Right off the main drag, early bird is a cute spot with nice seating inside and out. Their menu is thoughtful with filling breakfast choices that don't seem too heavy. I got a salmon with quinoa and avocado, and it just hit the spot."
Earlybird,4.5,11,"Cafes, Breakfast & Brunch",4,4-Jan-23,"like the vibe and food here, service can improve.  may need reserve a seat during peak time."
Earlybird,4.5,11,"Cafes, Breakfast & Brunch",2,13-Nov-22,Food and restaurant had a weird smell but customer service was great. The pancake was good
Earlybird,4.5,11,"Cafes, Breakfast & Brunch",5,24-Jun-22,"One of the best brunch spots I've ever been to, and I'm not even from here! We came here on our visit from the US. Kind of a hole in the wall, but I think if more people knew about it it would be crowded every day. We got the strawberry and cheese French toast and the chili scrambled eggs, and they were SO GOOD. The eggs especially-the chili was a nice twist I've never had before on scrambled eggs, and the corn that came with them was amazing. 11/10 recommend!"
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,5-May-19,"Thanks Yelp, you helped me find my favorite Hainanese chicken rice place in the world so far.  Got a quarter chicken and rice set for $15.80 which confuses me since that's actually quite expensive and I hear people say $2-$7 in other reviews, did it go up or did I do something wrong?  Price aside, my first bite of the rice, which looked like plain white rice btw, was chickeny rice heaven. Chicken was perfectly juicy, soup was good and I'm sold. I almost always have trouble finishing the rice at other places but I gobbled every last bit of the meal.  Tried Tian Tian and Ah Tai and still rate this highest in terms of overall taste in a set. Obviously at $16, it's twice as expensive.  Tian Tians chicken was just as juicy, but the sauce and the rice wasn't comparable to here."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,1-Apr-22,"Every time I return to Singapore, I gotta have my chicken rice here. 30-40 years in the business and they are still going strong without loss of quality! Affordable too! Make sure if you want roasted chicken rice, you gotta be there before noon or the lunch crowd will wipe them all out. By 1:30-2pm you can be fairly certain their roasted chicken is sold out. I know because I've been there too many times! Pandemic did not change that in anyway so that definitely means something!"
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,24-Jun-18,"My favorite chicken rice to go place, it's been there for like ever and they have a constant flow of customers. Just make sure if you want roasted chicken you come before 3pm or it would be sold out."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,12-Dec-22,"Just as good as 5 years ago. Juicy tender chicken, very tasty chicken rice. Still frequented by locals, not tourists."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,10-Dec-17,Excellent chicken rice. Located in a shopping area patronized by locals. Diners are also locals. No fancy tableware but very clean. Had white (boiled) and roasted (brown with slight hint of herb) chicken. Very good and simple soup.
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,13-Jun-17,"This place has been around forever and correspondingly I haven't been back in years. Now that I'm working in the area, I had to give them another try.  The lunch lines can be long but things move quickly and you shouldn't need to wait ages for a seat. Just be prepared to share a table with another group if the restaurant gets crowded.  Now for the food! I ordered the steamed (or white) chicken thigh which is served with fragrant rice and a bowl of soup. I also ordered a side of vegetables. What surprised me was that the chicken here was great - jelly like skin (always a good sign), super tender meat and very flavorful sauce. The rice paled in comparison, it was oily but didn't have much of the fragrance you'd expect. The vegetables were alright, a little on the salty side but nothing to write home about. I'd come back to have that chicken again, and maybe try the roast chicken.  Lastly, it's a mom and pop shop so cash is king. That'd be the case for almost every small eatery in Singapore but just thought I'd point it out for the many tourists who visit the area. It's kinda expensive for what you get but it's also in the Orchard Road area so I should adjust my expectations."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,25-Nov-18,"Delish, inexpensive and good fast food. $2 for a good Hainesese chicken rice. I would recommend anyone who wants to get into the world of HCR by trying some of the locals here. Everyone has their own tastes but this version is lighter compared to others in the market.  Oh and be warned, the spicy chili sauce is super spicy but complements well with the ginger sauce and chicken.  Oh so yum!"
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,7-Mar-16,"I ventured out on my own yesterday and was out and about. I was in the area for Laduree and was hungry after about 16 hours of IF, I was ready to feast. I searched my bookmarks and walked about 20 minutes to get to here. The reviews and good ratings were justified.  The place was packed. I actually had to wait to be seated. Like w/ all the food stalls, service and ambiance is non-existent. I'd question cleanliness as well however, as I watched the patrons devour their food, I was excited and very eager to finally have lunch.  The lady asked if I wanted roast chicken or steamed chicken. STEAMED, of course! My order came out in like 2 minutes and for the 1st time, my bottle of water was actually cold. The rice was fluffy, the chicken was super tender, and the broth was flavorful. The dipping sauce had a kick to it.  Literally after all of the meals we've had... expensive, street, casual, American, whatever... this was my favorite meal. It's no wonder the folks here are not overweight; the portions are super small to what I'm used to. Fear not though because I had about 4 macarons right after my lunch."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,1-Jul-17,"When you're in Singapore you gotta have their hainanese chicken.  Dropped by this place after a recommendation and it definitely held up to its name. We ordered both types of chicken, regular and barbecue. The chicken was very tender and it was placed over fragrant rice with a delicious bowl of chicken soup on the side. Its a great place for a cheap yet delicious meal on the go."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",3,7-Jun-16,"I was expecting a lot from this place especially after looking at the reviews over here. Sadly I was disappointed. For the price of $7 I paid, the value of the meal I had (Chicken rice with a plate of liver) failed to hit my mark. Why?  The quality of the chicken is just so-so, and the small portion didn't help much. The liver didn't taste nice, and my friend agreed with me. Other than that, everything else was normal, nothing special about it.  While sitting near the counter, I saw many articles raving about this place but after finishing my meal, I wonder to myself. You have to be kidding, right? But I won't ruled this place out for my future chicken rice meals. Perhaps, will drop by again to give it another try.  Best is not to come during meal times as it is often crowded and the queue can be quite long . Fortunately, I came at the right time (5 plus), there were a few vacant tables and service was fast. Not the friendliest staff but got my meals pretty quickly. However for the price I paid, I am disappointed."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,14-Sep-12,"Yay, Yelp Singapore!!!! I've been waiting patiently for you for the last six years!  I came here twice on my last visit to the island nation, thanks to a rec from a foodie Singaporean who claimed this place had the best chicken rice in the land.  Well, after two visits, I think he might be right! Or at very least, it has to be near the top of the list.  Hainanese Delicacy is at the very top of Far East Plaza, hidden amongst a random assortment of hair salons and older food outlets, and far away from the trendy shops downstairs. This place is old school-- cramped quarters, tables shared with others, and dirt cheap prices. Very crowded at lunch as it seems popular with those who work nearby.  The chicken itself was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, the rice full of oily flavor; all incredibly delicious when topped with thick soy sauce and chili. Free bowl of broth on the side. We ordered a side of pea sprouts and these were great too. You have the option of getting steamed or roasted, but steamed is traditional, so that's what we went with.  So good I could've easily eaten there many more times, and I will again on my next trip back."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,24-Jan-19,"Simply delicious and fast service Chicken and rice are full of flavor... 0.8 sgd rice is essential to go with the chicken. As hungry as I was, quarter to half chicken would satsfiy me :-))"
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,19-Aug-17,"Not a bad place to check out in Singapore. My husband wanted to check out the chicken and rice scene in this country while we were honeymoon-ing.  We got the roasted and steamed chicken, which were alright in my opinion. Couldn't really taste the difference, but my husband preferred the roasted chicken. However, the broth soup you dip the chicken into it was phenomenal. Definitely my favorite during our visit here.  Next up, duck soup. My husband heard that this was good, so gave it a go. I had it almost immediately when it we got it and almost burned of my tongue. The flavor itself was alright - it was tomato-y and tart, which I'm not huge on, yet it was warm and comforting to drink the soup. The duck wad alright.  Overall, the experience was good and a great catch pricewise. Would consider coming back if we're in the area again."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,14-Mar-18,"It took me a while to find this place via google map.It's in the mall and on 5th's floor.Otherwise you may find similar restaurant but for Thailand food. Toasted chicken are only available in the morning and I missed it.White chicken tastes delicious, fresh, rice seems saulted, nice but not enough for me. Soup just so so. Only cash supported, Alipay or other payment method not supported. As Chinese, I say it worth trying.Eco dinner."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,19-Jan-16,When asking for the menu the lady responds with a condescending we don't have a menu just chicken rice. Well ok there is menu on window with some other items so just a FYI. Food is good but I've found they are mostly the same everywhere. The best being the Five Star hainanese but it's just too far.  Edit: bumped up after revisiting.
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",3,28-Dec-16,"It's quick and conveniently located in orchard St mall. Traditional chicken and rice. No frills but it was my only option to try that dish in my short trip. Traditionally it's just in some ginger broth, no skin. Many places had variations but I'm not well versed enough."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,15-Apr-16,"At 5 floor at Far East, Orchard rd  There are 7 tables and long q. You should go before 11 am or after 2 pm if you don't want to wait.  The steam chicken so yummy  The duck soup is nice  Recommend!!"
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,25-Aug-12,"When I decided to write this review, I realised with a start that I have been patronising this stall since I was 12! It was one of the places my friends and I would end up having our meals after school before proceeding to while away our youth in the shopping complexes in town, doing nothing in particular.  This is probably not going to be the tastiest chicken rice but that's exactly what I like about it. The chicken is always tender and doused with a good scoopful of light broth and the rice is always fragrant. You won't get that guilty feeling you often do after a plate of chicken rice elsewhere. The chilli also hits the right spot with a good level of spiciness and taste. Also, don't forget to give the duck soup with salted vegetables a go.  I will probably come by at off-peak hours because it tends to get crowded but it also is an experience in itself to drop by at the stall's busiest period. You will probably find yourself huddled around the same table as a couple of strangers, gobbling down your meal - there is definitely a certain charm to that."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,24-Mar-13,"I've been coming here with friends since i was 16. And i know they've been around waaaay before i started frequenting this place. This is usually the 1st place i visit after i land in S'pore; partly because it's so central and easy to meet up with friends, but also because the chicken rice here is unpretentious, simple and sooooo tasty. I always get the roasted chicken (drumstick + things) with an extra side of chicken rice + soup + veggies  Absolutely delicious"
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,19-Dec-15,"Ate here the previous night after watching Star Wars: The Force Awakens (aww yea) With 3 male friends, the 4 of us ordered a full ""white"" chicken ($36) and a plate of vegetables. I'm not sure about the individual cost of each plate of rice and the vegetables but it was $40+ in total. Seems relatively pricey but for a shop in expensive town area the value is decent. And yes, we were all pretty full after our meal, so you can judge the proportions for your next meal. The meat is soft and tender, and generally deboned - although there were some portions with bones, but they weren't a huge hassle to eat. Rice is fragrant and soup is not entirely plain (there's the taste of chicken bones and other ingredients). Not a bad place though, but for the price I rather go somewhere else (yes I'm stingy). Nonetheless if you find yourself in town and would like a relatively more budget meal without cutting down on quality this is a good place."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,30-Mar-16,I wouldn't call this place the best chicken rice but it's definitely one of the most nostalgic one cause it has been around since long long time ago. A nice place to go for comfort food; tender chicken on top of fragrant rice that goes perfectly well with their home made ginger and chilli sauces.  Their salted vegetable duck soup is my favourite! Never fails to warm your tummy and tickles your taste bud.
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,2-Dec-18,Ate here twice on our trip. A hidden gem - and super cheap. Something about that rice mixture with the sauce and chicken - yummy and simple. It's not as heavy and is has more of a balanced profile. Food comes out stupidly quick as well.
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,2-Mar-14,"Wow, I'm surprised that this place actually has 7 reviews already. The chicken rice stall on the 5th floor of Far East Plaza is a hidden gem ;)  Highly popular among locals and people who work around the area, the stall is always full even during non-peak (lunchtime) hours. It is slightly more expensive too since it is in town, but well worth it! I love their roast chicken best which is super tender, and the rice is fragrant but not too oily. Loveeeeeee."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,26-Jul-15,"Great chicken rice! Some of the best we have had since being in SG. The owners were very helpful - we got a half chicken (breast meat only) for 4 people with rice and it was S$20. Chicken was juicy and good, as was the rice.  Definitely use the sauces - the chili is spicy, thought! :)"
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,29-Oct-18,My all time favourite Hainanese white chicken rice. Love thier salted veg duck soup. Avoid lunch time also fully booked.
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,15-Jul-16,"Fast, delicious, and simple. I have tried quite a few restaurants and this one has the best chicken rice in Singapore.  Don't be daunted by the long lines - the place has high throughput and it's worth the wait."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",1,10-Oct-18,"I do not see what is they hype over this chicken rice store. The chicken is hard and not juicy. The rice is dry and feels like eating a normal plate of white rice. The price is also more expensive than normal chicken rice. To make the whole experience worst, the Uncle taking our orders is very rude and arrogant. Overall, the whole experience is sub-par and not worth the money and your calories intake at all. You can definitely find better eateries in orchard area."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,3-Apr-16,Great experience! Awesome food just melts in your mouth. Broth is out of this world. Would recommend for sure; this is a local spot so don't expect the service just enjoy the food!
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,28-Oct-15,A good place to get your craving for hainanese chicken rice. The place is packed during lunch so be prepared to be seated beside or around strangers. Hello stranger! Nice chicken rice eh?  We ordered the steamed chicken rice and it was a quick and helpful service. We got our fills of tender tasty chicken with great condiments of the garlic ginger paste that's a must to add more kick to the flavor.  If you are around orchard then this place can be an option for your to go to :)
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,24-Jul-12,"I've been going to this place for about 12 years now. It has always been at the same location, and it's pretty famous all over Singapore. Eveyone keeps talking about the River Valley Chicken Rice.... I don't know - but for me, this is kinda like one of the Best Chicken Rice in Singapore. They are famous for their lunch time queues - so that's why I prefer going during dinner.  What I Love: The place is always crowded - but it's worth the wait. The rice is nice and moist. The chicken is yummy, and very tasty. Apart from that, the soup and vegetables are really yummy that it all just goes so well together. I can eat this everyday - but for health reasons, I have this every other month or so.  What I Don't Love: Their drink options are pretty basic. But who goes there for the drinks eh? :)"
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,28-Oct-13,"This chicken rice stall has been here for many years and oozes off nostalgia for many's student days. For me, I only started eating here for the past year. I find the rice surprisingly good, coupled with the chili and dark soy sauce. The rice is also non oily which is the kind of chicken rice I like.  We ordered a half chicken, with both white and roasted chicken. Encourage no one to do this. They did this on one single plate and the sauce for white chicken kinda ruined the roasted chicken. Best to order separately.  White chicken is soft and absorbs the sauce well. However it's not as soft and slippery smooth as Ah Tai's. The chicken itself is comparable to Tian Tian but Tian Tian's rice is still the best.  Probably due to location, it's crowded during peak hours and it's slightly more pricey. Certainly not the best to me but a decent chicken rice place you can recommend to your friends."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,8-Feb-16,"Chicken and Rice is what they're obviously famous for. The place gets really packed.

I happen to be staying at the hotel across the street."
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,15-Nov-16,"Follow Yelpers' recommendations to visit this restaurant - located on the top floor of a low end shopping centre. The restaurant is surrounded by hair salons, some of which have suspiciously dim lights. There is no menu so you just need to make a choice between boiled chicken or roasted chicken. And there are some small side dishes but there is nothing for a big bite. Ordered the boiled chicken with rice but had difficulties in picking the sauces to go with chicken. So just watched the locals... Rice was quite tasty, cooked with chicken soup, but chicken was a bit plain. Apparently the place earns a reputation because locals just keep coming."

We heard of this place through searching the internet, because H.C.R. was something that was on the to-eat list here. It's a family run business--an elderly woman served us, and my were the chicken rice dishes delicious! The chicken was so juicy and flavourful... unlike some of the dry chicken I've had back home. The rice was very aromatic and also delicious. Couldn't get enough of it so we ordered another serving. Prices were reasonable. Would come again the next time I drop by the SG!"
Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,29-Aug-14,"The other decent chicken rice place on top of Far East Plaza in Orchard, but I like TIan Tian and the Golden Shoe one a tad bit better. I don't like the vibe of this mall- totally run down and the seating here is awful."

Hainanese Delicacy Chicken Rice,4.3,41,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,21-Nov-12,"Excellent chicken rice stop in Singapore. Most importantly, the food delivers in terms of quality and taste - the chicken and rice are not oily, meat pieces large and tender and the rice light and fragrant. The side vegetables are also quite good, and not greasy. The place is generally clean with air-conditioning(!) Westerners, bring your own napkins a la Singapore style. The long lines dissipate rather quickly, so be a little patient, and you'll be rewarded in no time."

Pistachio,4.3,15,"Mediterranean, Middle Eastern",4,22-Jul-22,"It's pleasing to see that Chef Khaled has maintained high standards since moving from Balestier to Wheelock Place. In addition to the usual Middle Eastern dishes, there are many others that are not often found at restaurants here (eg. Fish Singary, maybe in honour of Singapore?), all well executed. The tabouleh salad is very refreshing, although it's a bit too strong for my taste, containing lots of parsley; I prefer the North African version. The good news is you now can have wine with your meal, and can pay by MasterCard/Visa. Service could be more pro-active, as you have to ask for water refills quite often. Thus location used to experience high turnover (a super-thin-pizza place, then a Thai joint). Let's hope Pistachio stays long. The cosmopolitan and affluent tenants of Wheelock Place should help ensure that it's the case!"

The good news is you now can have wine with your meal, and can pay by MasterCard/Visa. Service could be more pro-active, as you have to ask for water refills quite often. This location used to experience high turnover (a super-thin-pizza place, then a Thai joint). Let's hope Pistachio stays long. The cosmopolitan and affluent tenants of Wheelock Place should help ensure that it's the case!"
Pistachio,4.3,15,"Mediterranean, Middle Eastern",5,10-May-18,"Best gyro in Singapore! I've been searching and waiting for a good gyro or shawarma for the past few years, and Yeero Gyro finally delivers. From the same folks behind Pistachio, they just recently opened Yeero Gyro in the same mall on the same floor. I tried the chicken gyro and thoroughly enjoyed a pita full of succulent chunks of chicken, accompanied by lettuce, tomato, onions and lots of tzatziki sauce. The flavor and quality really set this apart from other versions I have had in Singapore. At $12, it's not exactly cheap but given the amount of meat and quality, it's definitely worth the price. There are a few other items such as Greek fries and pizza on the menu, which I will also try."
Pistachio,4.3,15,"Mediterranean, Middle Eastern",4,9-Jul-16,"Pistachio recently opened up, taking over an awkward space previously occupied by an awful pizza joint. Happy to say, Pistachio brings some very solid Mediterranean/Turkish food to the Novena/Balestier area. After 3 visits, I would say that my favorite is still the humble Shawarma sandwich. It's definitely one of the better versions around, although it could use a little more spice or perhaps some harissa. On the other hand, the grilled plate was very flavorful - the meat is done medium rare as a warning though. They also have a delicious pide or Turkish pizza. It could probably feed two although I was able to polish it off during a recent lunch. The owners are very friendly and the kitchen is introducing more new dishes each week. The kitchen is a bit slow, though. But still Pistachio is a very welcome addition to the neighborhood!"
Pistachio,4.3,15,"Mediterranean, Middle Eastern",4,1-Dec-17,Nice spot for Mediterranean food.. its in the middle of a mall so not the best of ambience. Service is a bit spotty. But the food was pretty good overall..I particularly liked the fish and meat platter. The rice accompanying the fish was excellent too.
Pistachio,4.3,15,"Mediterranean, Middle Eastern",3,26-Sep-18,"This is not a normal restaurant because it is halah, meaning serving food in compliance to the Muslim religion. As such, alcoholic drinks are not served by the restaurants. You may bring your own wines to go with your meals and you also have to bring your own wine glasses. Corkage fee of $50/bottle is levied."
Pistachio,4.3,15,"Mediterranean, Middle Eastern",5,9-May-17,"Absolutely Fantastic, extremely affordable Mediterranean food in Singapore. While the seating area is informal as it is located in a mall, don't let that fool you. The food is excellent. The service is excellent. The owners are extremely friendly. I look forward to my next trip to Singapore, so I can eat here again. Bring your own wine as they don't have a liquor license."
Pistachio,4.3,15,"Mediterranean, Middle Eastern",2,19-Feb-18,"I came here for dinner.  The food was above average for Middle Eastern/Mediterranean cuisine. However, that was pretty much the only good thing going for it.  Price-wise, everything was pretty standard for restaurant fare. However, the service and amenities were far from restaurant quality.  Tap water could not be provided, there was no waiter to take your order (you had to walk up to the counter to order food), and they did not accept credit/debit card payment. Finally, the seating area is more like a cafe than a restaurant, with shoppers walking around inches away from your table. All of this is fine if Pistachio were a casual cafe, but at the prices it charges, this is not acceptable.  The prices on the menu also do not reflect GST, so expect your final damage to be higher than you thought.  On the bright side, the pita with hummus is delicious and great value-for-money.  Save your money for somewhere else, and come just for the pita."
Pistachio,4.3,15,"Mediterranean, Middle Eastern",5,16-Oct-16,"Delicious , generous , freshly and carefully prepared middle eastern food ! Value for money..... yummy ! Addicted already , have to keep going back there to taste everything on the menu"
Pistachio,4.3,15,"Mediterranean, Middle Eastern",2,17-May-18,For the price of the food which cost me $25 the tzatzi sauce was very bland and had no flavor to it plus the salad which was drenched in olive oil and lemon juice really didn't have any kind of flavor. The only good thing from this restaurant is that the meat did have flavor to it. Over all I would not recommend coming back to this restaurant.
Pistachio,4.3,15,"Mediterranean, Middle Eastern",4,10-Jun-17,"Wow! Outstanding food and friendly staff. Egyptian cuisine at it's finest for sure. 8 of us went and each got something different, shared it family style. Awesome. Chef came out to greet ha, which is always nice. Definitely need to go back in more time ."
Pistachio,4.3,15,"Mediterranean, Middle Eastern",5,22-Jun-16,"New mediterrean joint. Great tasting authentic food, at decent prices and friendly service. I really enjoyed the kebab platter. Some menu options are unavailable and waiting time takes a while, but may just be opening month teething pains. Worth the while!"
Pistachio,4.3,15,"Mediterranean, Middle Eastern",5,25-Mar-18,awesome place. great value good service. awesome food. Basic setting in a mall but the taste makes up for it. Won't be our last time. Too many things to choose from.
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,8-Jan-24,"We went to CUT steakhouse for romantic dinner to celebrate our honeymoon, and this place was the perfect restaurant for an intimate evening. We were very impressed with the service here as well as the steaks (we ordered NY strip wagyu and Filet mignon wagyu which were very delicious). The Peewee potatoes were our favorite sides  The wine list is also very impressive as well with a huge inventory that seems endless! In our opinion, this was the best high-end restaurant within the Marina Bay property for romantic evening. We will definitely be coming back here in the future!"
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",3,17-Apr-24,"I am baffled how this place has a Michelin Star. I was just underwhelmed the whole time. Everything from the service to the food was average. My husband and I came for our anniversary and last dinner in Singapore. We started with the crab cakes and bone marrow. The crab cake was excellent but the bone marrow was bland and boring. For our mains my husband got the Wagyu Prime rib I had to ask them and confirm with them if it really was ribeye. It was cooked correctly medium rare but lacked any flavor. I got the bone in NY strip and mine was cooked more on the medium side and it desperately needed salt. If the sauces that it came with were better then maybe it could've been saved but for a Michelin starred steakhouse the meat should be able to hold its own. Our waiter asked us how the meal was going and when I told him how underwhelmed I was he brought it upon himself to give us a dessert on the house, which was kind and filled with good intentions, however, we were completely full and just wanted to leave. I won't be recommending this place to anyone they'd get a better tasting steak at the buffet at the MBS hotel."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,27-Sep-23,"A good steakhouse, but service is not as efficient as it seems. Started with the tuna tartare and probably the highlight of the meal. Nice flavour and great combination with plentiful avocado. For a main, I had the Wagyu ribeye, in retrospect I should have ordered either the fillet or sirloin. Given the marbled (ie. Fatty) nature of wagyu, coupled with the fact that ribeye is so well marbled, I actually found it a bit too rich (which is a strong statement from me). That said, it was high quality wagyu cooked exactly as I ordered it. The caramelised onions were okay, not great, but the kale was excellent. The service was very mixed, it took a long time to get served and then a long time to get the bill (both times we had to flag down other waiters), when we did have service it was excellent."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,18-May-23,"This is the first time have dinner in New York. The beef portion even is 600gms is good for two and tasty (grass fed). Meet the same standard to other country like Singapore. However, for Mac n cheese seem different way they used cheese in other places and Ricotta pasta is good I would say both Mac n cheese and Ricotta the taste for me is bit salty.  The oysters are fresh and price is reasonable. The ambiance are cozy.  The service is very good and explained well on the menu.  Price wise still good to spend$$ on certain special occasion."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,5-May-23,I tried cut in different countries and first time in NY. I find that the Mac and cheese is different. But the meat are all standard and very tasty.
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,15-Jun-22,"Singaporean street food is very affordable. A bowl of noodles cost about $5 SD. A 14 ounce ribeye steak here costs $128 SD. A side dish of fries is $18. Still water is $12 per bottle. It's a Michelin star restaurant so you can expect it to be expensive, but throw in the fact that it's located at Marina Bay Sands, now expect yo pay even more than you would in the United States.  The steak was excellent. Was it better than the US? But the service, sides, and food are very similar to the states. In fact, they don't even serve Singaporean beer because they want to be like an American restaurant. Interesting!  Was it worth the money? It depends what you're looking for. To have excellent service in a high end, fine dining restaurant, and with excellent food, then it's worth it! We love it! In all the street foods we've eaten in Singapore, none ever give us paper napkins. We don't know why. It's just is. To be able to sit down for dinner with someone handing us a nice cloth napkin was worth the money!  For Thinsulin fans, there's plenty of green light options."

CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,25-Mar-16,"I recommend making reservations because as a walk-in, they are most likely going to seat you in the lounge where shoppers gawk at you through the window as they walk by. Not a great ambiance, all things considered.  The steak tartare was a tad under seasoned but the richness of the quail egg yolk made up for it. I wouldn't order it again, truthfully.  The menu is pretty straightforward. I wanted the porterhouse so Jerry and I ordered the portion for 2. Little did we know it's 1 piece cooked and divided in half. I wanted rare and he wanted medium-rare. It was a little weird that they brought the steak out to me to have me look at it first before cutting it. They then walked over to Jerry to confirm his medium-rare wishes so they can continue to cook it.  I got the bone marrow and my colleagues ordered a few side items. I forgot what it was but I remember not a single of them complained or said anything negative about the taste, presentation, and quality of the food. The bone marrow was tender. It melted in my mouth. It was so rich, I felt guilty as I was eating it but it was too good to stop. I wish they served it in a ramekin instead of a plate though.  The porterhouse was tender. Their house made steak sauce was delicious. The steak was seasoned perfectly and did not need any flavor enhancements but a taste of their steak sauce was addicting so I kept adding.  Finally time for desserts.  I was the only one that wanted desserts. I ordered the chocolate souffl¨¦. Knew that it would take at least 15 minutes for it but ordered it and was waiting anxiously for it to come out. The portion is pretty massive so you can share if you please but I don't share when it comes to food so I enjoyed it, orgasmiscally until it was all gone. Their crime fraiche was thick and creamy, the chocolate sauce was rich, the ice cream was more frozen but it melted beautifully and sinfully w/ the huge, decadent, and delicious chocolate souffl¨¦.  Service was impeccable.  10% off for MasterCard users.  Thanks for allowing us to expense this!!! Love my company."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,25-Nov-20,"The best steak and mushroom I've ever tested. I've travels a lot and had plenty of great cuts of beef. This one took the cake, I can't stress enough how delicious the mushrooms were."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,26-Dec-18,"I've been craving for steak this past week and finally decided to stop by this location. The filet mignon was tender, flavorful and delicious. I was too hungry so I devoured it before taking any pictures The bone marrow was mouth watering. All staff members were attentive without being too excessive.  Glynn, the manager at CUT, definitely made my short visit to Singapore a 10/10 experience. She volunteered to call the souvenir shop within Marina Bay Hotel twice to verify its location and look up some information for me. Glynn also recommended a popular drink of the restaurant, ""Rough Love."" Unique and easy to drink. You should try it! I attached the picture below.  Thank you everyone at the CUT for an amazing meal and experience!"
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,30-Sep-17,Superb service. You can't expect anything less from Wolfgang Puck's restaurant. And it's at the Marina Bay sands hotel so the standards are high when dining here.  Plenty of steaks to choose from. They also make some good cocktails.  Again service was great. They kept coming back ensuring that my needs were met.  Reservations are recommended although I'm sure they can squeeze you in.
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,23-Jul-18,"One-star Michelin steakhouse in MBS. Expensive high quality steak. Had the trio of beef to sample different cuts - New York Sirloin, Wagyu, and USDA Prime. Both the NY sirloin and the USDA prime were top-notch but the Wagyu was a let-down. Definitely had better wagyu beef elsewhere...Portions are small, especially when considering the price. So overall the steak alone would be 4 star.  Starters are amazing - we ordered the saut¨¦ed mushroom and patatas bravas - definitely one of the best starters I have had in a while  If you don't eat beef, the pork chop is excellent - juicy and tender with a very good complementary sauce. Large wine selection but unfortunately sommelier wasn't the most helpful. We asked for a red wine recommendation and he basically pointed to so many that it misses the point of being a recommendation  Service was really slow and not attentive / definitely not what we would expect from this type of restaurant. Mediocre service counters the 5-star starters to give a 4* rating."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,24-Jul-16,"Mr. Puck is - next to Arnie - one of the more famous and successful Austrian ""exports"". He now ranks amongst the best chefs/restaurateurs in the world, and ""Spago"" in LA is an institution that has found worldwide fame, now present in many locations, Singapore included. Another venture of his is CUT, focusing on steak. We booked there for our wedding anniversary and enjoyed it tremendously.  As there are many other reviews raving about this place I'm trying to keep it short, hoping to contribute to a coherent picture. Service is very friendly, efficient, and, which I always find refreshing at ""celebrity restaurants"", authentic. No snobbishness, just smiles all around, staff greeting repeat customers with true joy of seeing each other again. A rare trait at this kind of place.  Interior is modern/elegant, darkish, with great lighting, and the wonderful celebrity portrait photography by Martin Schoeller featured in the entire location and on menus.  Food is delicious- I won't go into detail, we had crab/shrimp cocktail starters, steak and dessert - and it arrives pretty fast, which we did not expect with the restaurant being very busy.  The wine list features a great many choices and we really enjoyed our Pinot Noir from California. Prices for wine are on the steep side, but I guess this isn't news to anyone in Singapore..  I really enjoyed the background music as it was a very good mix of old classics (e.g. David Bowie) and contemporary (e.g. Coldplay) - a daring choice but a good change from ""the usual"".  Toilets are very sleek and very clean, and so big!  I cannot think of anything else to describe and would just mention at this point that the restaurant is located in a luxury shopping mall, which is of some benefit if you want to coax your significant other into visiting Gucci post-dinner.. (didn't work for me but one can always try ;-))"
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,21-Oct-13,"Came here on a pretty amazing, random whim with a great gentleman & his crew while visiting Singapore. My goodness... The presentation & flavor of the drinks & food were AMAZING. And orgasmic. How they made carrots, Mac & cheese, mini Kobe burgers, fish tacos, & potatoes (all separate dishes) taste like culinary heaven is beyond me.  The bartender and servers were courteous & lively which definitely amped up the atmosphere. I thoroughly enjoyed myself."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,7-Apr-21,"BEST RESTAURANT EVER!  The food is great! 11/10! The Service is good! 4/5! The ambience is good! 4/5! The Price ... it is what we pay for... 3/5!  From its appetizers, its house baked bread, main courses, drinks to dessert.  Very good experience and great food!"
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,29-Nov-18,Just wanted to say thanks to Mary and the people at CUT who made for a very special evening. Had the Porterhouse for 2 perfectly cooked to medium rare. Service was excellent. Was given a nice little surprise at the end of the meal to celebrate an engagement. I'm glad I chose this place. It was worth it.
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,8-Aug-15,"This has got to be the best steak house I have ever experienced.  I am formerly of New York City and had my fair share of solid steaks. I've even frequented CUT restaurants in other locations including Los Angeles and Dubai. But for some reason, the entire experience from the moment of making a reservation to the final touch of the best desserts make this restaurant not only the best CUT but also one of the best restaurants in Singapore.  What also makes this place that much greater is their cocktail and wine selection. Their cocktails definitely among the best in Singapore - fresh ingredients and creative ""mixology"" similar to rival bars that make their living off this kind of stuff (the only ones I've found in SG so far that can even compare to the creations here are Bar Stories on Arab St. and Nutmeg and Clove on Club St.). You can even come here for the drinks alone and enjoy - my favorite is Duke of Earl - a cocktail they make with their own earl grey infused gin. Also love their ""spiked"" Thai Iced tea. :)  Anyways for the food, their Kobe beef is unreal. Frankly, you can't go wrong with any of their steaks.  Lastly, their dessert. They also have the best dessert I've ever had in my life. HIGHLY RECOMMEND their Baked Alaska which has kaya ice cream inside. UNREAL!!!!!!!!!!  Make it a mission to stop by here for any or all of these three reasons - drinks, steaks, dessert. Every person I've brought here ends up loving it as much as I do and for good cause. You won't be disappointed. :)"
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,19-Mar-18,"One of the best steaks I have ever tasted.  We went with the porterhouse steak and it was good for two people, portion wise. It comes with two sauces and 4 different mustards. The steak was very well prepared in terms of flavor and we really enjoyed it. Ordered kale and the patata as sides. The patata was really good as well.  Finally went with the chocolate and the caramel dishes for dessert. They were ok but nothing special, wouldn't mind skipping them next time."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,9-Mar-16,Best steaks in town!  The Kobe steak is just amazing! I had the filet mignon. The pork belly starter was also really good.
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,13-Aug-18,"There are few tv celebrity chef restaurants that I've been to that have truly delivered with the menu. We stopped in only for drinks (which were divine) and after several drinks we were persuaded to get these mini tuna taco sliders. I've had similar dishes at other restaurants (think tuna tartar). These were so good, they had both my boyfriend and I talking about them the following day."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,25-Apr-15,"This is probably the best steak house in Singapore ! We ordered the wagu grade 8 steak. It literally melt in our mouths !  We started with the tuna tartar. Excellent  Then we had the steak that was shared. Heaven  Wine was ok , on the expensive side. They won't allowed us to bring our own ! A bit of a downer  We finished with sweet port n chocolate souffl¨¦.  A highly recommended place if u are willing to spend at least $200+ per person."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,8-Nov-16,"I took my husband here for his birthday while in Singapore and this is hands down one of the best restaurants we've been to. The server was A+ & so was dinner. My favorite was my mocktail (apple, cucumber, & basil).  What a great experience? Needless to say, he enjoyed his birthday."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,30-Sep-13,"The exterior of the restaurant was intimidating but thankfully I had the courage to walk in and order a drink at the bar. Because, it proved to be one of the best decisions of my life (sorry for the exaggeration).  The bar menu was reasonable in price (not as crazy and costly as the fine dining menu ). And, they give you a free bowl of gourmet popcorn. And when they say gourmet, they mean gourmet. Their popcorn was cooked in bacon fat and sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.  I am not much of a drinker and am completely uneducated in topics such as wine and rich-sounding cocktail concoctions. The super friendly staff politely offered their honest suggestions and I ended up with a drink called Dying Love (I may be mistaken but sounds like it). The drink was visually gorgeous - a raspberry resting on a slab of ice, floating on a pink sea. Similar to the movies Titanic and Life of Pi.  From the bar menu, I ordered the mini steak burgers, 4 small ones on a cute white plate. While they are small, trust me, they are enough to fill you up. As an added bonus, they use the same high end steak they serve from the more expensive fine dining menu. So, it's a more affordable way of tasting their steak without spending 100 dollars.  All in all, Cut is one of the most gorgeous and stylish restaurants I've been to. I have yet to try their fine dining area. But from my initial experience at the bar, I am sure I won't be disappointed when that time comes."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,4-Jan-13,"I have not been to one of Wolfgang's CUT restaurants here in the states yet but loved going to business dinners at the one in Singapore at the Marina Bay Sands. It is meatlovers heaven here. Cool comfortable interiors, probably some of the best service in singapore (service isn't that good there generally but is changing). American size portions, great cocktails, side dishes, and the desserts! The management is american so they hold to their U.S. standard on the aged beef. The meat trolly is uncommon in singapore so it was nice to see its appearance here. You can't go wrong with CUT but warning it is pricey....have someone treat you there for maximum enjoyment :)  BTW - DB's, Mozza and Osteria across from it are all also equally great! Rumor is that Thomas Keller is coming to Singapore soon at Marina Bay Sands.  BTW- dress in singapore is one notch down - so where here you would be expected to probably have a jacket on and the ladies dressed to the nines....in singapore it is much more casual which makes the singapore location an even more casual atmosphere for steak house beginners."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,9-Dec-12,"Awesomeness !! This review is overdue and I finally found time to write it.  I visited the other CUT locations as well and am a regular here at CUT Singapore, in particular the one in Beverly Hills. I found the whole setup and service here in Singapore much warmer and more pleasant with better service as well. If you are used to cold shoulder service, think again and visit CUT!  The seating was nice and a short notice table was not a problem though not sure that is because my name popped up in their computer. The staff was and is always polite, professional and naturally friendly. A 5* experience. Note that it is a pricey experience as well though, think 350-400$ for a two person meal. But worth it!!!  You will be presented with the various options of meat and the server explains to you what the specifics of the meat are.I personally like the 'Bone in Filet Mignon' medium rare paired with a nice red wine.  This time we chose an Argentinian Malbec, a pleasure to drink. Note that I'm not even pretending to be a wine expert at all - I just like to drink what tastes well (to me) and so far Argentinian wines did not disappoint me in any way. The young lady who presented the wine was super friendly as always.  The steak came, together with the sides which this time consisted of mushrooms and spinach.  The highlight ladies and gentlemen is the dessert. Have the chocolate souffle and you with either foodgasm or die and go to heaven (or a combination of both) right at the table.  So if you are looking for your perfect dining experience, come here and you won't regret it!  Enjoy ~ S."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,18-Nov-15,"I really don't have much negatives to say about this place despite it being twice as more expensive than the LA version, which usually annoys me. From what I recall, they had some kind of discounts if you make it before the happy hour ends. We came here for our anniversary dinner few months back, and the service, atmosphere, and the private enclaved seating in some areas well catered to our celebration.  I am a bone marrow fan and it didn't disappoint, unlike the one in Osteria Mozza across the street (though I'm also a long-time fan of that restaurant). It was juicy, flavorful, and exactly messy and authentic as the ones I'd eat in New York. D usually gets the RIb Eye, and I get the Filet Mignon paired with a simple creamy horseradish, and both were on point. On the side, caramelized white sweet corn and creamed spinach are our usual pair.  Overall, a place to go in Singapore when you're missing some good quality meat in your life!"
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,22-Aug-15,"CUT is on the playing field with the top tier of steakhouses in the world, offering top cuts of beef imported from the leading beef nations including waygu beef from Japan.  The menu and the atmosphere were certainly more of what I would expect in a West Coast or Las Vegas steakhouse (no surprise)--contemporary, minimalist furnishing and decor. Small plates with a modern cuisine flair, like shrimp cocktail with a wasabi panna cotta and delicate yuzu sauce. The US Angus filet I had was absolutely spot on and delicious.  The wine list had a pretty good range in the by-the-glass selection and the bar had a good variety of cocktails--classic and innovative both.  Stylistically I prefer the 'old school' New York/Chicago style steakhouses (this I would not categorize as ""Traditional American Restaurants"")--where the emphasis is on the excellence of the ingredients and mastery of basic dishes that compliment the centerpiece of the meal. So while I enjoyed my experience, the match goes to other team--particularly when one considers that this player has a bigger paycheck than who it's up against."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",3,12-Dec-15,"Don't get me wrong, this is a great restaurant BUT I would never recommend it to anyone as it is massively over priced. The food is excellent and the service quite good. I had the pork belly as a starter and it was melt-in-the-mouth perfection. My husband and I shared the porterhouse which was delicious and perfectly cooked. The onion rings are excellent as well, exactly the way you always hope they'll be but rarely are. I had the S'mores for dessert and loved them. The wine menu is seriously extensive as is the cocktail menu. I loved the music but not sure that the Ramones would be to every diner's liking... But $900 for dinner for two at a steak house is far too much in my opinion. The mark-up on wine is huge. I just can't justify the cost."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,8-Aug-15,"I've been dying to try this place for a while now, finally got to try it last night. Ordered the U.S. filet mignon, UK ribeye, Hokkaido scallop carpaccio, creamed spinach, & wild mushrooms. The cook on the filet mignon was great!  The portions were just right for my boyfriend and I.  Though we were stuffed at the end of the meal, we couldn't help but try their desserts. The kaya baked Alaska was to die for! It wasn't too sweet, so it was perfect !!  Also had the sweet wine & port."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,14-Mar-15,"Beyond being the best steak restaurant in Singapore, CUT won my heart forever when manager Glynn came to my rescue during a whisky and food tasting event that took place early in my pregnancy.  As it was just only 2 months into my first trimester at the time, I was still holding off on telling my colleagues, happily ordering mocktails on the sly. With high end whisky, the tastings were in small glasses and I pulled manager Glynn aside on my way to the ladies' room to explain my challenge. Luckily, Glynn managed to subtly replace my whisky with tea (same color!) and I was unable to enjoy the evening stress-free.  The food was exquisite as always. My favorites included the bone marrow flan, the blue crab and shrimp ""Louis"", the pork belly, the steak and the pear crumble.  PARTING THOUGHT: we're going back to celebrate getting to the second trimester!"
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",2,28-Jun-18,"Event Planners - Beware! I am an event planner and had a very disappointing experience. I gave 2 stars because the food and service was good, the management team organizing was not. I felt they were dishonest with the amount of wine my group consumed which we have no choice but to pay because I was not onsite to confirm. I was also charged a higher amount on wine as they didn't have the type I chose of which I am still awaiting a refund, from early March. The communication has been slow and not genuine. My concerns were expressed multiple times and still have not heard from a manager."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,20-Dec-13,"The beef steak at cut totally blew my mind. I don't even like steak that much and I never had a craving for steak before. But my experience at cut have changed this! The cocktails were absolutely amazing too. All prepared beautifully, tasted great and packed a nice punch! I would totally come back here just for a drink next time. The down side of this restaurant would be their steep prices but the location, food and drinks here do justify it."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,20-Nov-14,"The place I go to for my Gin & Tonic fix just cause they make the best one around.  As for the steak, I won't say it's out of the world kinda standard but it's decent with a hefty price tagged to it. Besides that, the souffle and the creamed spinach is a must-have when you're there.  Regarding the ambiance, I find that the dining area is rather dark and probably due to how the restaurant is layout, the noise/sound bounces off the wall which kinda make the place really noisy/loud when people start chitter-chattering the night away (which make it hard to carry conversation properly). However, the bar area is just perfect. To be honest, I rather be sitting at the bar area to have my dinner than the dining area.  (Nonetheless, I can't wait to head back there for rounds of G&T already.)"
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",2,22-Aug-13,"My brother warned me into coming to this restaurant. He went CUT in LA before and he said it was an underwhelming experience. The steaks were too 'modern' and even a bit pretentious. But I still want to try a modern steak house, and I haven't been to a Wolfgang Puck restaurant before so curiosity got the best of me.  The appetizers were alright. I've tried the oysters, pork belly, warm veal tongue, and they were all very decent.  But the steak that I ordered was an extremely huge letdown. I've tried and fell in love with Snake River Farms beef before when I was in the US. Theoretically, what the breeder seek to accomplish is marry that wonderful beefiness of American beef, with the luxurious marbling of Japanese beef.  I was ecstatic when I discovered that they were gonna serve that beef in CUT Singapore. Even before flying off to Singapore, I already knew what I was gonna have for my steak.  My favorite cut of the meat is the rib eye, particularly because of that fat, decadent layer up top known as the rib cap. When my Snake River Farms rib eye came, I was shocked with horror. It came WITHOUT the rib cap. I thought I was just unlucky, and during my 2nd visit, I ordered the same thing, only to face the same nightmare for the second time. -_-  The rib eye itself was not that good too. It was too dry, and too chewy and was a great injustice to a Snake River Farms beef.  I don't think I'll be back to CUT ever again. There are many better steak houses in Singapore and I'd rather go to Ruth Chris' or even Morton's instead."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,19-Oct-19,Celebrated my nieces birthday dinner here. First time to Cut and it was awesome!!! Kobe beef steak was incredible as was the service. Thank you!!
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,8-Sep-12,"5-star food at 5-star prices  Singaporeans are passionate about their steaks. It's not uncommon to find $100 steaks on the menus of many high-end restaurants. At Cut though, the prices go significantly higher when you throw in the tempting array of appetisers, sides and mains - which are done well, if you need to justify the bill. A hearty dinner for two with wine will reach past $500 easily.  When you're mulling over the menu, the waiter will trundle over a meat trolley filled with American cuts in white napkins and Japanese cuts in black. The service is absolutely impressive - if you are familiar with Morton's you'll know what I mean.  For wagyu lovers and first timers, I highly recommend the Tasting of New York Sirloin - it includes Kobe style from Snake River Farm (120g), USDA Prime corn-fed (120g), and Japanese wagyu from Shiga (60g). As you can guess, these are pretty tender and marbled choices, so if you prefer something more robust, try the Angus ribeye or such. It's a real meat market here with just about something to suit everyone.  Wolfgang Puck pops by to Singapore about once a year. so don't expect to see the man himself - instead, he's got a whole crew of stellar managers and chefs from the US to oversee this jumpin' joint. The music's rather loud but we're told it's the way they like it in the States."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,23-Mar-13,"I-went-back-so-new-review:  still utterly fantastic, and wonderfully enjoyable dessert at the marina bay sands. it is understating it to say that this place is now my favorite in singapore - and no, I've not had their steak, and no, I'm not quite planning to. I have an incorrigible sweet tooth, and it aches for this behemoth of a chocolate souffle.  their other desserts are pretty much up there with the best I've had locally, but it's the souffle that shines - there's some magic in the substantial lightness, and all the textures and temperatures in it. I could wax lyrical all day (and I've done it once before), but really, just look at it - chocolate sauce dribbling down the side while creme fraiche and ice cream sink their slow way into that airy nest of chocolate.  but you've heard me say all this before - so I'll try to spare you further expostulation. suffice to say that the standard's consistent, the chocolate deep and satisfying - well worth any gym-rat behavior.  we also managed two other desserts this time - a deconstructed banana cream pie of creme brulee, chocolate pearls and a caramel banana ice cream; and a chocolate hazelnut marjolaine cake with caramel popcorn and salted popcorn ice cream.  both were pretty good - and I especially liked the the chocolate-hazelnut slice (though I might be biased as a newtella addict), though the accompanying popcorn seemed a little staleish. small detail though - we lapped everything up.  the place is dark and intimate, service friendly and efficient - and really, the prices aren't low but I'm more than happy to spend it here for the quality and portions. most definitely my favorite place here.  ---------------------------------------------- old review:  utterly fantastic and wholly incomparable bliss-out desserts at this famed steakhouse in marina bay sands. I have unashamedly fallen in deep mire with this place - it's now my go-to for indulging in sweets, and I'm afraid that it might just become an uncontrollable habit.  I've wanted to come here for a long time - and while I'm bursting with adjectives, let me objectively say that the souffle was high, fluffy, barely deflated even after standing, and when eaten with the chocolate ice cream and creme fraiche on top - was a revelation in deep dark chocolate and that gorgeous play of hot and cold. truly, this ranks as one of the best mouthfuls I've ever had."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,23-Jan-14,"CUT holds up with the best steakhouses I've been to in the USA, Australia, and Europe. We started our meal with the bone marrow flan. It was fantastic - it was rich and buttery. The garnish went perfectly with the marrow on top of a nice piece of toast. I was impressed. Additionally, the complimentary selection of breads, rolls, and breadsticks were all pretty impressive - it's hard not to fill up on them, but you should resist.  For our main, I split the porterhouse for two. Not cheap ($178 if I recall), but between two it's actually one of the cheaper menu options. They carve the steak table side, which is a nice touch, and it is served with an assortment of complimentary sauces and mustards. The flavor of the steak itself was fantastic and exactly what you would expect from dry aged meat. The steak had a fantastic crust and flavor from the garnish of thyme, butter, and garlic. The meat was amazingly tender and nearly collapsed with each bite.  For sides we had the onion rings and broccolini. Both were delicious and perfect accompaniments for a steak dinner. However, they obviously were not the most memorable parts of the meal.  Service was truly fantastic here. Any request or order we had was met almost immediately. Even our order of onion rings came out a little late (maybe 5-10 minutes after the rest of our order) and they gave it to us on the house. Overall the meal was pricey, but by comparison to other restaurants in Singapore and taking into account the quality of the food and service, I didn't feel overcharged."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,16-Nov-12,"I just had a full dinner at Cut just last week and it was an awesome experience. I went there for a birthday celebration and had a party of 6. The place itself was well decorated (although the, as usual, the lighting's really dim) and the service was quite good.  We ordered the Scallop and Blue Crab appetizers, individual steaks and Mac & Cheese and Broccolini sides. For me, I ordered the USDA Prime Ribeye Cut Steak. For the appetizers, I would high recommend the Scallop. The Scallop Carpaccio with Ponzu Sauce is excellent as the Scallops were very fresh and perfectly cut. The Ponzu sauce gives it a very fresh and tangy outlook that goes perfectly with the Scallops. The Blue Crab is pretty meaty and tasty, so start with the scallop first before moving on to something more heavy like the Blue Crab ""Louis""  As for the steak, my Ribeye was excellent. The meat is tender, juicy and the marbling of the fats was done very well. The temperature was just right too. On top of that, the meat is grilled on hardwood and charcoal, giving it a nice ""woody"" and ""charred"" taste. This gives it extra flavor and taste, making the high quality steak here even better. Just a small warning though: The Ribeye here has A LOT of fats (which is the way I like it), so if you are health conscious or just don't like the heavenly taste of fats, stay away from the ribeye and go for either the sirloin or the fillet mignon (the leanness part of the meat). I had a bite off the other people's Australian Wagyu RIbeye and the meat is so much better (though the price is much higher). The dessert is just as good as the main course.  Overall it was an excellent meal but that comes with the high price. Some may think that no food is worth that amount but I believe that this meal is more of a gastronomical experience (complete with ambience and service) that is worth the occasional splurge. A last word of advice: To fully enjoy your meat, it'll be good to read out on the difference of the different cuts available (or you can count on the staff) , in order to know exactly what your preferences are.

CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,6-Jul-14,"Fantastic food, cocktails and service!  We had chips and mini burgers in the lounge area, and two cocktails each, followed up by the chocolate souffl¨¦. The chips were wonderful, my husband loved the sliders (I didn't try them, since I'm vegetarian) and the cocktails were delicious. The true hero of the meal though was the souffl¨¦. It was delivered with a flourish and an explanation and it was wonderful.  The service from the bar staff was fantastic. They were attentive without being suffocating, and they were good at making suggestions. Highly recommended."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,27-Apr-14,"OK, I'm a Ruth's Chris and Mastros (SC Plaza) bigot when it comes to steaks, but I gotta say, CUT is now in my top 3 steakhouses. First of all, the service is fantastic. Two, the drinks are FANTASTIC -- best dirty martini I've ever had in Singapore. Third, my steak and the extra cheesy mac and cheese along with the tuna tartar appetizer were ""lick the plate clean"" good.  I also met some of the nicest people the night I ate at the bar - from NYC, Houston and NJ.  This place is classy so I recommend business casual attire. They also had a great selection of wines and I had a Spanish red wine (can't remember the name) that was fantastic."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,27-Aug-12,"I have not been to Cut for a proper meal but have been for drinks and dessert. Located in Marina Bay Sands, the restaurant is posh and one of the celebrity restaurants at MBS.  Cocktails here are amazing. One of the best places to get cocktails here in Singapore. Its not cheap, but they do not skimp on alcohol here at all. The concotions are very interesting and sophisticated. Dessert here is very good as well. We tried the chocolate souffl¨¦ which was amazing. A nice place to go for a chill night of drinks."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,10-Mar-13,"There was a point in my life when I visited CUT monthly, because it was SOOOO GOOD.  Everything from the little cheese poppers (in lieu of bread), right down to the impeccable service, this place is a dream to dine at! Try the lobsters! It is surprisingly delish. They also slice up the lobsters with deft, orchestrated simultaneous strokes.  Dessert is also a do. Yum yum yum!!!"
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,4-Aug-18,"Dined here a few weeks ago. Crab cakes, butter lettuce, filet with the apple crumble dessert. Enjoyed it very much. Filet was excellently prepared. Would definitely return here next time."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,30-Aug-15,"The food was AMAZING! We loved everything we had there. We had salads, soups, filets, and sides...and everything was excellent! Also the bartender, Loogie, made me a mix drink that was out of this world! It was literally the best drink I have ever had.....it was as big as my head, had an island of ice that had a live flower on top!!! I'm in love :)"
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,7-Nov-15,"Came here for a birthday dinner and it definitely lived up to expectations and beyond. Excellent food, service and ambience. We got a private table but was able to people watch in the middle of restaurant. A simple menus with steak and steak, plenty of choices on sauces and sides. Each staff was perfect in carrying out their services and they were professional to the nth degree.  Dessert must try is the apple crumble. The s'mores was slightly disappointing. Otherwise a very perfect dinner as a dinner date or a party."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,20-Jan-16,"I don't eat steak often, mostly because almost all of my beef experiences in Singapore have been disappointing. I was pleasantly surprised, though, when I was dragged to Cut. I got the USDA New York sirloin with Argentinean Chimichurri sauce, potato puree, and creamed spinach. The sides were exactly what I expected. No surprises there, but archetypes of a high-end steak restaurant. The steak was what surprised me. Perfectly medium-rare, tender, with a smoky, crispy sear. I felt like I was in Chicago. Sure $88++ is not cheap for a 12oz. steak, but considering the market, it's a good deal. I've had some terrible steaks for not a lot less."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,19-Feb-18,"I took myself on Valentine's Day after working a long day. For starters, the bread was delish. I preferred the pretzel bun with the soft butter. I ordered a nice glass of red wine with help from their sommelier. I also got the ribeye and the potatoes. The ribeye was cooked perfectly, medium rare. And it was a nice cut. Those potatoes were fabulous! Roasted, smashed, then crisped and garnished with lots of savory onions! For dessert, I splurged and got the chocolate souffl¨¦. Oh. My. Goodness. This is literally in my top 3 desserts. Ever. It was just pure delight and not too chocolatey. When the souffl¨¦ arrived, the waiter topped it with melted chocolate, a dollop of whip cream, and then topped it with more chocolate. Gah! I also got a glass of sweet red wine, which was a nice accompaniment to the souffl¨¦. I'm drooling now as I think of that delicious meal! Enjoy! Oh! And I almost forgot! They gave me a long stem red rose and a box of homemade chocolates. They were fabulous! I didn't see them give them to the guys at the table next to me so thanks for making my day!"
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,19-Nov-14,"Steak in Singapore, why not! And why not go to CUT for that consistency that we come to expect from Wolfgang Puck restaurant. What a brilliant night at CUT I had last weekend. Was traveling solo and had a few meals at local establishments and decided to go visit CUT - this is my third experience at a CUT restaurant (Las Vegas and London being the other two) and I could not find one thing wrong - everything surpassed my expectations. From the excellent seating at the bar, to the attention I received from the bartender, the cocktail waitress to the GM himself, the service was over-the-top.  And the food? Amazing appetizers and I did get a chance to try a few of them. The Scallops were divine. The dirty martini was everything I had heard - my best one at a bar. The steak (had the filet) was cooked perfect and would rival any steak you'd get in the US. The wine pairing was perfect as was the final cap on the experience - a Singaporean version of baked Alaska. They had to roll me out of the restaurant, but at least I had a big smile on my face.  Lastly, I don't normally cast judgement on others, but I do find it funny that people constantly comment on how pricey restaurants are. If you do your homework (and it would not be hard in this case) you'll know the general price for a meal. This place is expensive. I reserve going to CUT when I'm in the mood to splurge and have a great time. I actually don't even look at the price as I know it's going to cost a lot. Is it worth it, absolutely! Is it for anyone, no! Just know that if you are willing to spend it, you will have an excellent night out - I did and have not regretted one visit to CUT."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,16-Apr-14,"Being a vegetarian, I will admit that I have only ever been to the lounge area at CUT. But I feel no shame in reviewing the place despite my clearly ""incomplete"" experience, because it is just that good.  What can I tell you about the cocktails here? I don't want to recommend a specific one... I'm sure your tastes differ from mine. But I will say that they are all intricately prepared and most of them will blow your mind. Should I talk about the Rough Love, a combination of gin, umeshu and champagne, is served in a large wine glass, with a giant cube of ice. A single raspberry sits atop that ice cube, and remains there until you finish your drink. The drink looks like an expensive pink diamond ring. A delicate balancing act, both taste wise and architecturally. Or should I tell you about the time my hubby asked them to make a penicillin, and I sneaked a peek of the bartender pouring Domaine de Canton in the drink? ""It's not going to be the same.."" I muttered under my breath, disgruntled. It wasn't... but it was amazing. Or should I mention that they barrel age some of their cocktails? The negroni that I ended up with was softened and rounded off having spent some time in the cask, and it tasted timeless. I guess I could go on and on.  The main reason to recommend the lounge at CUT is the fact that their bartenders are great artists, and they have a great passion for the art of making good cocktails. And if you ever do go, don't forget to order a portion of the butterscotch apple dessert -- it's the bomb.  Singapore has many cocktail bars, but a few great ones. I count the bar at CUT and the one at Tippling club as the only ones to understand truly what it is like to create a balanced cocktail, time and time again."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,17-Nov-14,"Very good steak and ambience is nice - a bit dark, but modern and stylish.  Dinner is pricey - expect to pay about 150-200 per person when all is said and done. I prefer Morton's to Cut"
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",1,3-Oct-17,"Went here for dinner. I had the Australian porter house. My steak was bland, no flavor, and had a lot of fat not trimmed, and rare was done as medium well. Informed my waiter and she just said she will let manager know."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,20-Sep-14,"frequented Mozza and DB Bistro but somehow avoided the steak house across because I've never had a good slab of steak here in Singapore... until I ventured into Cut. We started with the appetizer of bone marrow flan, it was creamy and flavorful and please do share it. No one should eat this entire dish alone. We also shared the steak tartare which was also fantastic but the serving was good for two. So two appetizers for two pax was too much.  We ordered the US Wagyu Ribeye and the seasoning, texture, and doneness were perfect. I was blown away. I tried the different sauces they provided which were good but I prefer it without any sauces. We thought of ordering a side dish but wanted to save space for dessert.  For dessert, we shared the souffle and it was the perfect exclamation point to a delicious dinner!"
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",1,21-Nov-13,"Prices are ridiculous, especially for mediocre food that every other restaurant is doing. Where's the innovation?"
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,27-Feb-15,"Coming to CUT was definitely a good choice when I went to Singapore, the steak was delicious and perfectly cooked. If you want to get steak while your abroad in Singapore, this is the place."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,24-Jan-15,"This was dinner for NYE 2014. Or is it 2015? Either way, the food was expensive. We knew what we were getting ourselves into. Marina Bay Sands, and what not. Suffice to say, no one was disappointed despite the cost. My Manhattan had to have been the best damn Manhattan I have ever had. The wine list was extensive and, at the same time, downright ludicrous. The lamb with mint sauce was cooked to perfection. Ahi tartare was executed properly enough. I don't know if this is where I would recommend someone to go in Singapore for a nice meal, but it did the trick. They could do without the creepy framed pics of celebrities on the walls. We spent several minutes trying to identify Katy Perry. She looks like Zooey Deschanel, and I was thinking Marion Cotillard..."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,1-Nov-14,"When in Singapore, I love the food here. I don't question the quality...it always tastes fresh and lives up to its expectations. The irony is, I'm not a fan of steak. And either is my usual dining mate (who is vegetarian). So we order salads and ""on the side"" dishes in droves and feast in that style for the evening. The waitstaff has always been wonderful; sometimes we eat at the bar and chat it up with fellow patrons or the bartender. Great ambiance. Look forward to coming back again!"
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,12-Jan-13,"Great venue (too bad it's in a mall, albeit a very fancy one), the bar has good scene, the service is fantastic, and the steaks are just the best in Singapore. Hands down! Pricey, but not much more than other steakhouses in the city. But unlike other steakhouses, here the quality of the meat is fantastic."
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",4,8-Apr-17,"Only one time and this place has won me over. Despite being expensive, the food and service is great; plus nice ambiance makes it an overall enjoyable dinning experience. I had the New York sirloin for mains and chocolate souffle for desserts. Everything was simply cooked to perfection. Will be back soon!"
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,17-Nov-15,a little pricey but simple and straightforward dining. all items are great but I loved the chocolate souffl¨¦ in particular - really because it's quite hard to find good souffl¨¦ in Singapore.  service is a real performance.
CUT,4.4,62,"American, Steakhouses",5,5-Aug-13,Expensive but great meat selection n good appetisers too. Order their pork belly n mac n cheese. Highly recommended!
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,7-Jun-24,i need something special new ... please i see this things and i like it what you think about this https://buyozempiconlinemexico.org/
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,29-Nov-18,"I wanted to visit this place because of the soup dumplings.  I came here on a Sunday lunch time and they still had dimsum. Ordered three items: baked bbq pork bun, soup dumplings, and shark fin soup. I liked the pork bun and soup dumplings. The pork bun dough was crisp on the outside and the meat inside had a lot of flavour. The wrapper is thin and strong that holds the soup and meat well, that's how you know it's good wrapper. It was my first time eating shark fin soup. The soup was light and there's a huge dumpling that holds all the meat. The shark fins all dispersed when I opened the dumpling. All in all, it was a good experience."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,31-Dec-17,"Made a reservation for dinner a couple weeks ahead via phone and was promptly welcomed upon arrival. Eating Cantonese food in Singapore by a Singaporean chain was questionable at first. The experience was world class.  Meal started off with pickled vegetables which were tasty and flavorful.  Opted for the Peking Duck, Wasabi Prawns, and Foie Gras appetizer which was just heavenly! Peking duck was perfectly crispy and the wasabi Prawns was flavored to perfection. The foie gras was decent.  Entrees included the salted egg prawns which consisted of a dozen or so juicy and flavorful prawns lightly fried and then dipped in salted egg yolk. Yum!  The US beef with Gai Lan was also excellent. ...it was rather odd having US beef in Singapore. ...trust me on this one!  Next came the Kurobata Pork with mushrooms which was also heavenly! Super tender pork in a world class gravy.  Ended off the meal with Lobster with XO sauce noodles and their famous mango pomelo sago. Lobster was delicious and their XO sauce was on point.  Service throughout the meal was decent. Seems like we were serviced by a new hire...  $110 SGD/head after tax and service for dinner."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,15-Jan-17,"Came by for dinner the other night and it was a world class experience and definitely worthy of a Michelin Star! Managed to be seated upon arrival right when they opened.  Staff was very professional and attentive throughout my meal. Ambiance of the restaurant is top notch. Full A/C, luxurious seating and ambiance!  Started off with the Peking duck, wasabi Mayo Prawn, and seared foie-gras. The foie Gras was a tad overcooked. The Mayo wasabi prawn was excellent and so was the perfectly crispy Peking duck!  Moved on to the salted egg soft shell crab which consisted of very bold flavors. Portions were generous!  My favorite was the US Beef Gai Lan which consisted of very slippery and tender beef with perfectly stir-fried Gai Lan.  Ended the meal with a wonderfully presented mango pomelo Sago over Coconut ice cream. The dry ice made this an exciting dessert!  $95 SGD/head including 10% service charge and 7% GST. There is a $.5 charge for napkins."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",3,8-Nov-22,"Not like before. Service is slower, More prone to upselling, and their room booking has a Minimum spending and no set Menu orders is allowed. Wasn't like that before , Food taste quite consistent, would give it a 7.5/10 rating in terms of taste.   But I do understand cost is high now. Will go there again soon and will update the review."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,12-Feb-18,"We visited the restaurant, which is located at the Ion building, for dinner. If I would have to classify it, this is a fine dining Chinese restaurant. Extensive, but well appointed decor throughout, clearly stating that you are at a classy restaurant. Very comfortable sitting, nice tablecloth - all sets you in a mood.  To prove that this is a fine dining restaurant, it offers a great wine selection, which includes practically all first growth Bordeaux (Lafite, Latour, Mouton Rothschild, ...), as well as Petrus, Massetto, DRC and if I was not mistaken, even a cult California Screaming Eagle. We had 2011 Rauzan-S¨¨gla with our dinner, and the wine was outstanding after 20 minutes in the glass.  Excellent service, starting with wine and food pairing recommendations. Considering our choice of wine, we got recommendations to go with crispy duck instead of Peking duck, as crispy duck is less sweet - and the recommendation was spot on, excellent pairing - also the duck was cooked perfectly. We also had tofu and green beans, each dish is excellent on its own. One of my dining companions was raving about his cod with spinach sauce. We also had the dessert - fresh mango pur¨¦e with an ice cream, which is also beautifully presented on top of cold steaming bowl - another high point of the dinner experience. Once again, excellent service - prompt, attentive, helpful and friendly. Definitely recommended."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,18-Jun-18,"It's official! Taste Paradise is my favorite dim sum place in the world. This is no exaggeration! Been to this Taste Paradise for many years. Never a time the food was bad or experience a service lapse.  Today was no exception. Lunch = delicious + satisfying = Happy Me :)  FOOD 5/5* I ordered the following (nah, I did not finish eating all, the staff packed whatever I could not finished for me to take away),  *5/5 for every one of the dim sum dishes I ordered.  1) Classic XO Carrot Cake - A must order, nobody does carrot cake like Taste Paradise. I had tried similar elsewhere but there is no comparison.  2) Baked Honey BBQ Pork Pastry - This pastry was another item here that was the best compared to many other establishments which offered the same. The crust was buttery and flaky in a good way. I only despise flaky when it is associated to humans. The filling was generous with savory honey BBQ pork.  3) Char Siew Bun or Stream BBQ Pork Bun - The buns were so fluffy :9 The fillings which were honey BBQ pork were savory and so good.  4) Steam Cheong-Fun with Honey BBQ Pork fillings - Rice flour rolls which were thin and soft. This is how it should be. It was light, healthy and tasted good.  5) Deep-Fried Prawn Dumplings with Salad Cream - Generous and fresh prawn fillings in every of the dumplings. The dumplings' skins were so thin and crispy ;D   AMBIENCE 5/5 No tacky d¨¦cor but elegant beautiful surrounding. Comfy plushy chairs, nice table settings and lots of seatings.  SERVICE 5/5 Jorrine the hostess at the door had been working here for years. I recognized her. Always friendly and hospitable. She led me to one of the room inside. The server Shaun took very good care of me the moment I sat down. He was very pleasant, well-mannered and attentive.  Taste Paradise has never let me down. This is THE best restaurant I would recommend anyone who visits Singapore when they want some top class dim sum/Chinese food accompanied with 5 star service and ambience. This is truly a well deserving 5 stars establishment in Singapore and ranked the top among all the 5 stars restaurants I rated."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,16-Jun-15,"I have decided in recent time to be more stringent in giving out a 5 star review to any establishment I come across.  Made a reservation days ago for lunch for a party of 6. On weekends, the restaurant has 2 settings, one from 11.30am and the other 12.30pm. Originally I made a lunch reservation at 11.30am. 15 minutes after making the reservation, I changed my mind and called back. No one picked up the phone, I hung up the phone but right after I hung up, the restaurant actually called back!! That's amazing!! The restaurant actually bothered to return call when there was a miss call. Sweet!!  Arrived on a Saturday at 12.30pm. My other friends had texted me minutes before and suggested I better went ahead and ordered the food. Reason? They all were running late. Sigh!  I changed the number of party from 6 to 7 since one of my friends was bringing her folks. The hostess was very friendly, another staff led me into the restaurant. The restaurant is beautiful. We kept walking till the staff led me to a private room. I was pleasantly surprised! The restaurant actually gave us a private room! The room was absolutely lovely and simply exquisite.  Started placing some dim sum items. Shortly, all my friends came and we started ordering more food. Every single item we ordered was extremely fresh, well made and taste extremely delicious. Taste Paradise definitely is the gem and easily edged out fine restaurant like Man Fu Yuan for dim sum. The common dim sum items like prawn dumplings and Siew Mai taste better than very good.  It's official, there is not a single Chinese restaurant in Atlanta that comes even close to Taste Paradise.  Food : Prawn dumpling - A+ Siew mai (minced pork dumpling) - A+ Rice roll with bbq pork - A+ Honey glazed bbq pork - A+ Prawn with Mango roll - A+ Peking Duck - A+ Duck with vermicelli - A+ Baked BBQ pork pastry - A+  Just by writing this review gets me really excited. I hardly get that excited over a Chinese restaurant.  Service - 100% A+ Staffs were friendly, helpful and kept refilling tea.  The following day I asked my brother who lives in Singapore if we can go dine at Taste Paradise. He said this ""but you just went there yesterday!"" I replied ""there were too many people yesterday, I was too shy to eat more. With fewer people, I will have more to eat! Hehe.."" So he said Yes! He said we can go there in a week's time after our trip to Tokyo. Yippee!!  So here's a 5 star review from me to a well-deserved Taste Paradise, my favorite Chinese restaurant in Singapore and everywhere else."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,13-Aug-18,"Semi-upscale dim sum / Cantonese place in Ion. Overall good dim sum / Chinese dishes. Personal favorites are the carrot cake (stir-fried perfectly for the right balance of crispiness / chewiness with complementary tangy sauce). The pork ribs were also very tender and the char siew pao is definitely one of the better ones I have had at Cantonese restaurants in SG. The standard items like siew mai, etc. were standard good / what you would expect from this type of Chinese restaurant  Nice ambience and convenient location - good for family gatherings. A bit expensive and should make reservation"
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,7-Oct-21,"I really like the food here, would say it's slightly fusion Chinese food. Service is really good and the environment is classy as well. 5 stars!"
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,8-Aug-19,"Service is great. The food was yummy. Had dumplings, soup and pork. All good."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,21-Dec-13,"Weekend dimsum brunch here is usually pretty crowded and require a reservation.  The dimsum here is delicious. The hargao has two shrimps in it, and the XO carrot cake is savory and flavorful.  The xiao long bao doesnt break easily and has lots of soup in it, while the liu sha bao oozes when you bite into it. The egg tart is also best eaten when served warm.  The bbq pork is rather pricey, but one of the best I've had.  Definitely highly recommended!"
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,4-Feb-15,Move aside crystal jade! Taste paradise is the next big thing for Chinese food in Singapore...  Why I keep coming back despite having to reserve every time I wanna eat here: 1. Conveniently located above Orchard MRT which is in highest floor of Ion mall. 2. Not overpriced or overrated. 3. Polite servers. 4. Have dim sums every sunday  My 3 most fave dishes: 1. Blueberry foie gras 2. Braised vermicelli (their bestseller in Carb dept) 3. Hot almond paste soup for dessert  Love this place a lot
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,10-Oct-14,"Is this what paradise tastes like? Because I can definitely get used to this.  First, let's start with their impeccable service. The servers here are polite, friendly and actively try to engage in conversation. They see you as an actual person rather than just another customer, constantly checking in to make sure everything is up to standards.  Their interior is very similar to hotel restaurants you find in mainland China, with revolving round tables and private VIP rooms.  Their food might come out a bit slow, but it's worth it given the fantastic quality.  The shark fin soup is best I've had anywhere. Clear, crisp broth with subdued flavoring that enhances the shark fin rather than overpowering it (which is something I've experienced on numerous occasion in the past). The spring roll that comes with it also adds another element in the texture department, with the flaky, crispy shell playing foil to the soft fins.  Their garlic fried and boiled lobster was also delicious, offering two interesting takes on the classic lobster dish. The fried pieces weren't overly greasy, and had enough meat to counterbalance the shell. The boiled meats, however, were the real creme de la creme. Served in a butter garlic sauce, each tender piece of meat melted the moment it entered your mouth, delivering an explosion of flavor.  Among the other dishes, I thought their Peking duck was cooked perfectly, though the sauce was a bit too sweet for my liking. Their braised pork cubes and steak bits were also pretty good, though a bit on the fatty side.  In terms of drinks, there was nothing too standout, so I'd recommend just sticking to Tiger.  All in all, a fantastic dining experience at one of my favorite places in Singapore."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,24-Mar-20,"Fabulous dim-sum as always. My favorite was the black truffle shumai, and the xo stir fried turnip cake. Very reasonable price for such a classy establishment. Hope to come back soon next time I'm in Singapore."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,28-Nov-16,Hands down this is the best dim sum restaurant I have been to anywhere in the world including Hong Kong which had seen a drop in the quality and service quality the last time I was there. The hargow and siewmai is excellent as well as the lobster noodle. Their soup is also great with excellent flavor!
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,25-Oct-12,"My friend strongly recommended me the place for dim sum. I have been meaning to bring my parents here for weekend's dim sum galore, alas, they are always fully booked!  On a lazy Sat afternoon, I managed to get a table for after 2 pm. They still serve dim sum at that time. Yay!  We ordered the usual char siew so, which is extremely delicate and crispy! It is a must order dish here.  Next, came the XO carrot cake, which I heard so much about. It tastes good and the carrot cake is chunky. I think another place which may be better than here or on par is at Chinatown's Spring Court.  I honestly, couldn't be bothered with taking photos subsequently cuz the food was just too delicieus to ignore.  We had the braised foie gras in blueberry reduction! It is super yummy!!! I would say it is basically foie gras terrine with blueberry jam! Crackling pork belly could be one of the best served in Singapore. I could have a whole plate to myself. Again, I think that goes for every single dish that we ordered.  Will come back for moreeeeeeee"
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,28-Feb-16,"I don't give out 5-stars lightly.  Best dimsum in Singapore.  Forget the TERRIBLE Tim Ho Wan (seriously???), or the cramped and overrated Victor's Kitchen (WTF???).  This place has dimsum to match HKG, has great service, and is reasonably priced.  XO sauce carrot cake is a ""die die must try"", and all other usual dimsum fare are of great quality. Har Kow and Siu Mai are large and full of flavour.  I'm also slightly addicted to the little pickles they give for appetiser...  Just make sure YOU MAKE A BOOKING on the weekends. Forget trying to walk in."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,6-Oct-16,"This is one of my favorite dimsum spots in Singapore. It's in orchard where all the action is. The decor is amazing inside. Tea kettle is quite peculiar. Food is amazing, from the egg tarts to the pork ribs. A must is a Liu sha bao or the egg custard bun. Careful though as it is very hot."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,15-Jul-12,"One of the better ones in the league of siew yok (roast pork) in Singapore. I've returned time and again for it alone. Crispy and crunchy skin with tender flesh and a sliver of fat, not too much, just enough to be justifiable for those counting calories.  Whilst most rave about dim sum here (best dish in my humble opnion is mango prawn, not quite the traditional favourite, but the best one for me), I thought their usual fare was more impressive.  Winter melon soup was served steaming hot in a hollowed out winter melon, a little corny but may be the reason it tasted better than others. Cod was very well cooked and it made my day that my mango sago came with a trailing smokey stream of dry ice; for only $4.50, I was getting all the fireworks.  The restaurant is lavishly decorated, typical of chinese opulence but with just a touch of modernity. It may annoy you that the wait staff continuously stress that you can only stay for 45min/1hr/1.5hr before you have to vacate your table, but service is prompt and attentive, and the quality of food easily makes up for everything else."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,5-Oct-15,"We had lunch from the dim sum menu - as other reviewers had pointed out, the dim sum is all round very well-prepared. We had plenty of items, and the hits included carrot cake, sheng jian bao (soupy pork buns), har gow (prawn dumpling), shumai (pork dumplings).  However one star off for slow service. Repeated badgering was required, and we had to wait unduly long to be brought our menus, to have our orders taken, and to get our iced water refilled.  We paid S$131.82 for 4 adults and 1 child."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,11-Sep-14,"I've been here a few times and keep coming back. Convenient location inside Ion, reliable dim sum and elegant surroundings make me a repeat customer. Yes it's a bit pricier than other places, but I like the fact that there's quality food, proper tablecloths, porcelain china and pretty teapots. Dim sum lunch was $40 and we left with happy and satisfied bellies. For the same price, I was at Marmalade Pantry at the Stables where I paid for 1 subpar dish and 1 latte (helped me decide to not go to MP again :)  Ask for a table in the back section...the drapes are drawn allowing the sunshine in. I sat in the front section of the restaurant this time and it was kinda dark.  Must: XO carrot cake (exquisitely made here), shrimp dumplings Avoid: BBQ pork belly. It was something like $18 for the tiniest portion I've ever seen."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,19-Jun-13,"I am from Hong Kong, and let me say that Taste Paradise probably makes the most exquisite dim sum in Asia outside of Hong Kong. Their egg tart melts in your mouth, salted egg yolk buns has so many layers of flavor I thought I was in paradise. Must order dishes also includes the Xo carrot cake, peking duck and the foie gras xiao long bao, which are much much better than those from their sister chain paradise dynastty: you can actually taste real foie gras in them!  The restaurant is a bit on the pricey side, but really I think it's well worth the money!!"
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,18-Jun-19,"Beautiful place, delicious dim sum, Wonderful service. When you're in Singapore try this place"
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,12-Aug-12,"Currently my favourite restaurant for Chinese food and dim sum, the dishes at Taste paradise are more exquisitely crafted and refined compared to Crystal Jade, Imperial Treasure and Tung Lok.  Must try dishes is their signature superior shark's fin in supreme broth accompanied with crispy spring roll that's served in a Japanese stone pot. If you are a supporter of the no shark fin campaign, the other dishes you must order is the XO carrot cake, peking duck, char siew and custard buns.  A great place to host clients and overseas guests, as well as weekend dim sums. My family has been holding our reunion dinners there since 2010 and it continues to exceed our expectations every year without fail so far."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,6-Jan-17,"Have been coming here for the last 4-5 years, and their egg custard bun is still (in my opinion) consistently the best.  Great location, great ambience, the rest of their dim sum is great as well. Crackling pork belly is heavenly.  Unfortunately everything comes at a price... in this case quite literally, the pork belly costs something like $13 for a tiny portion. The rest of their dishes are also pricey - worth it, but you probably can't afford to come here too often."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,8-Sep-12,"This concept restaurant of Paradise Holdings often gets outshone by the infamous rainbow xiao long baos of its counterpart, Paradise Dynasty, that lies steaming just four storefronts down. But If you are in the mood to shell out a little more for a fantastic chinese meal, this is just the place to be.  Brought a visiting relative here for dinner and every dish was worthy of praise. The spare ribs in sweet sauce is the first dish that comes to mind - caramelised sauce hangs off succulent tender meat that you won't be able to get enough of. The tasty crackling skin of the peking duck wrapped in thin popiah sheets is also probably one of the best I've ever tasted in Singapore. Another must-try would be the perfectly baked cod that simply melts in your mouth.  The interior of the restaurant is little too over-the-top for my liking but most will probably like it for the posh feel about it."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,22-Jan-13,Tasty dim sum. Pretty standard offerings with ha gow and siu Mai. Get the pork bun pastry. That was a stand out.
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,19-May-15,"You'll need to reserve a table on the weekends at Taste Paradise. They do at least two seatings at lunch.  The Carrot Cake is excellent. A re-interpretation of a hawker favourite. And well interpreted, I think. The addition of succulent bean sprouts is so welcome.  The roast pork (siew yoke) was recommended to us. It comes in a slab that has been cut down to look like it came out of a factory. It was okay, but for me, nothing remarkable in the way it was done.  The roast duck was good, if you like a roast duck that is trying to be a chicken. ie a little too juicy. I prefer duck that is like duck - allowed to be a little drier. But that's just a personal thing. It is very high quality, with crisp skin.  Between two roasts, take the duck.  There's some mango dim sum thing, fried and with too much mayo. To me, unless you are a huge mayo fan, it was cloying and just too mayo-ey. Why did Singapore ever think mayo and mango is a good combination? Or mayo and prawn? Ugh!  There's also a laksa bean curd dim sum dish. It was all right.  Chee Cheong Fun also okay.  I like that there's an attempt at incorporating local dishes/flavours rather than just offering standard Cantonese dim sum.  It's a pity that during the day time the curtains are drawn and you can't see outside. So it feels like it's night time at Ion. And some of the placement of tables is quite awkward."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,27-Aug-16,"Coming from the US, I've never had an amazing dim sum experience such as this one. The place is very classy and the attentiveness of the staff is on par with restaurants that cost 10x as much over in the states.  The price is a little on the heavy side compared to the local street food, but you certainly get what you pay for (and comparatively from the US it's the same as regular [crappier] dim sum establishments).  If you're looking for some of the best brunch experiences in Singapore, Taste Paradise is certainly one of them."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,4-Aug-16,"My family & I are their loyal customers & we have been following them since their 1st cze char & seafood place in Defu Lane Industrial Eastate. We love their signature dish, stone pot shark's fin soup, super much. They use superior stock for their broth & they are generous with their ingredients. Their ingredients are fresh & not inferior at all. Their Peking duck, set dinner, reunion set dinner (always overwhelming response & my family has to make very early reservation) & their dim sum are also our family's favourite. Yummy........Worth trying :):):)"
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",3,17-May-14,"Son't get me wrong, this place had some good dimsum, but the rent and tablecloths in this place are clearly not cheap, and the prices reflect that. I'm not sure it was so exemplary to be worth paying the type of prices they demand. For example, the wasabi shrimp were unique and interesting, but the shrimp themselves were not that flavorful."
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,13-Jul-12,"Taste Paradise is one of my favourite places for dim sum. They have a good variety of the traditional har gau siew mai stuff, but they also have some innovative new dim sum items that aren't available anywhere else.  Food : M and I are fans of the salted egg yolk custard bun! Taste Paradise offers one of the best salted egg yolk buns in Singapore ... my only gripe is that they only offer the steamed version and not the deep fried mantou version at Man Fu Yuan. Their har gau (shrimp dumplings) and siew mai (pork dumplings) are very fresh and well executed. May, the manager of Taste Paradise informs us that they are made fresh every morning. I really liked the prawn mango roll which is encased in a lightly crumbed roll instead of beancurd skin. Mayonnaise is also thoughtfully included in the roll, so it all oozes out nicely in one moreish bite. The char siew sou (puffs) are really quite awesome, good meat to pastry ratio and the latter is light, buttery and flaky. The carrot cake with XO sauce is not bad but I prefer the one at Space @ My Humble House. The steamed beancurd skin with bacon rolls are pretty awesome as well but the wu kok (deep fried yam puffs) don't taste as good as they look. The double boiled soups are also excellent ... very tasty and great for a cold day. The dessert of aloe vera with ice jelly and wolf berries is extremely refreshing too.  Ambience : I like how they have private rooms so one can request for them if one chooses not to be caught up in the hustle and bustle in the main dining hall. The layout is a bit labyrinth-like but nice modern Chinese decor with pictures of the different emperors from various dynasties in the private rooms.  Service : Prompt, polite and overall perfect. May runs a tight ship and trains her staff well.  Will be back for dinner soon!"
Taste Paradise,4.5,32,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,28-Apr-14,"Situated in the ION mall, this restaurant, specializing in dim sum was excellent. Comfortable seating and modern design. We sat in one of the side rooms next to the window and were served tea to start(btw tea is not complimentary). The service I have to say was on point, very attentive and accommodating. One issue was they forgot to bring out a few bowls of corn soup that was ordered so we ended up canceling and the English proficiency wasn't great but overall we were pleased. Preparing the Peking duck rolls takes time. The star of course was the outstanding food. The dumplings - fois gras, pork and shrimp were excellent. The previously mentioned Peking duck was beautiful - the crisp, fatty skin rolls were scrumptious and the meatized with noodles was delicious. We loved the light, bouncy xo carrot cake - which by the way I still don't know why it's called carrot cake. The beef and scallion was juicy and creamy. I'd highly recommend Taste Paradise for your dim sum gorging pleasure."
The Meeting Place,5,3,"Street Vendors, Seafood",5,10-Jan-13,"[4.5 stars rounded up]  Seafood stalls/restaurants in Singapore = crowd magnets. Some with significantly stronger magnetic waves than others. It is common sight to see groups crowding the larger tables (or filling up the whole establishment) and ordering a sumptuous feast enough to feed the continent of Africa (or in some cases, appease the hunger or photo needs of any single Elite yelper).  So when I first walked past ""The Meeting Place"" after having read a review about it some time ago when searching around Clementi...I was surprised to see the tables in front of it...empty at 7 pm...on a week*END* (then again, the little food centre is surprisingly a ghost town).  I walked straight up to the stall and was greeted by an uncle who stopped his conversation with another uncle (who I later found out was helping out at the store too) to ask if I was interested in anything. I guess I am interested...no line...great previous review...and a seriously hungry skinny glutton. Perfect combination.  ROUND #1:  BBQ Sotong $10 - great sambal flavor, fresh squid, cooked just right Kang Kong $4 - flavorful, once again cooked perfectly Cockles $3 - asked for well-done 2 plain rice $1 - rice was exactly the way I'd make it (slightly dry for a firmer texture)...after the first bite, i asked for another one  ROUND #2 (loved it, came back the next day):  BBQ Stingray $10 - luscious succulent awesomeness Pak Choi $4 - omgosh, I'm in love with this dish. My favorite style of cooking this particular vegetable to date. 2 plain rice $1  VERDICT:  The portions are TINY (especially with vegetables) but the flavors and food quality definitely make up for it. The people working there are also very friendly. I would definitely eat here whenever I'm in the area.  Yelp 100: 4/100"
The Meeting Place,5,3,"Street Vendors, Seafood",5,24-Jun-17,"This is really a must go place for BBQ seafood! The seafood are fresh and the chef is able to cook all the dishes to perfect tenderness! I am so used to eating overcooked bbq seafood as it's kind of that standard in many places..But when we ate here, my family and I just can't stop praising how good their food is! we ordered their BBQ sting ray, sotong, gong gong, vegetables and they are all so delicious!"
The Meeting Place,5,3,"Street Vendors, Seafood",5,5-Aug-12,"This is a seafood stall that serves up very very good sambal sting ray. The chili was very flavorful and the sting ray was very succulent and tender. With a dash of lime juice, there is almost no doubt that you and your friends would be fighting to get a morsel of fish. However, I have to admit that if you are a big eater, you might be somewhat dissatisfied with the smaller sizes and portions as compared to other places. However, the quality more than makes up for it I suppose. Anyways, the stall does serve many other stuff that could easily fill your stomach. The stall does serve other usual favorites such as oyster egg, which was good but not mind blowing. The kang kong was fairly well done as well, with the right amount of crunchiness and flavor. All in all, I would say that this is one of the better seafood stalls around."
The Marmalade Pantry,4.5,2,"Breakfast & Brunch, Coffee & Tea, Juice Bars & Smoothies",5,1-Feb-23,"We are staying in the adjacent Oasia Hotel and this lovely place in the lobby has a wonderful buffet in the morning.

The Marmalade Pantry,4.5,2,"Breakfast & Brunch, Coffee & Tea, Juice Bars & Smoothies",4,18-Jul-17,"Upholding the same standards as the other location we've been to, TMP offers a great selection of western and Singaporean dishes (albeit slightly on the pricier side unless you have the Entertainer App like we do) along with a good hotel lobby ambience and friendly staff. Nothing spectacular but fits the bill of a weekend brunch spot with a group of friends in the city core where you don't have to fight for a spot or have a table booked (even on Sundays)"
Club55,4.3,6,Buffets,5,30-Oct-18,This is the best breakfast buffet I've ever been to and I've been to a lot! Best natto and Japanese sides and Singaporean food was also really good. The pastries and cheese spread were awesome and the congee toppings were tasty. The traditional breakfast food were great and the delivery of the eggs made to order was awesome. The unlimited sparkling water is great and the service is excellent. I'd highly recommend coming here and adding the Club 55 package. The evening canap¨¦s were so tasty and delicious - lots of variety and food. I'm still dreaming about the natto!
Club55,4.3,6,Buffets,4,6-Jun-18,"Vacation is always a great excuse to treat yo self, and what more fabulously gluttonous way than a cheese and chocolate buffet? After a day of sightseeing and getting lost in the Marina Bay Sands complex, sitting down in the Club55 lounge felt like heaven. We arrived at 8 pm right as the restaurant opened and were seated immediately next to a window, which provided gorgeous floor to ceiling views of the bay and Singapore skyline. We were one of only about 5 tables the entire night, which worked out well for us as everything was always stocked and service was attentive. The buffet itself runs $48 per person (about $35 USD), with cocktails and glasses of wine running around $18 a piece. I opted for the wine pairing for $19, which included a red and white wine (both from Chile) as well as a port. The red was definitely drinkable, though the others were a bit disappointing. I'd probably suggest skipping this and going for a cocktail or other bottle of wine instead. There is a self serve coffee, juice, and soft drink bar, though this is not complementary and will be added to your tab. The bread and cheese selection here is solid. They had three loaves of sliced fresh bread - French, wheat (though the placard said sourdough), and one with dried fruits - as well as an assortment of breadsticks and more cracker-type carbs. As for the cheese itself, there were probably about a dozen options. The cheeses were mostly French, though they also had a Swiss Emmental and a few hard cheeses from the UK. My personal favorites were the Camembert and the blue/Brie combo. Rounding out the cheese bar was a small selection of nuts, dried fruit, honey and preserves, and probably the best grapes I've had in a long while. The serving setup was a little awkward, as most of the soft cheeses were presented as an entire wheel, with a few scattered knives throughout so that you can cut your own wedge. I think they also need to come up with a refrigerated way to present the cheese selection, as a few of them did look a little ""sweaty"" as the evening went by. The dessert bar here was an absolute dream. There were easily over two dozen options, and every dessert was presented beautifully. They were mostly individually served portions, though there were a handful of gorgeous cakes, like the cheese wheels, that were presented whole with cake servers to cut your own slice. Highlights for me were the assorted macarons, the dark chocolate and orange creme br?l¨¦e, and the assorted mousse cups (especially the caramel+coffee combo and the white chocolate avocado mousse. I also really appreciated that they had fresh grapefruit and honeydew to break up some of the richness. For some reason the dessert bar also had mini Milky Way bars and Hershey kisses, though I don't know why anyone would waste valuable stomach real estate with those. Overall, this was a fantastic experience, and well worth the money in my book, as just a ticket to the MBS observation deck is about half the price of this incredible spread. And with Singapore (especially the Marina Bay Sands area) being as pricey as it is, this buffet is an absolute steal."
Club55,4.3,6,Buffets,5,24-Feb-17,"Definitely worth upgrading to a club room or a suite to take advantage of the buffet breakfast 7-11am, afternoon tea with canopies2-4pm, and the evening 5-7pm spread with open bar and many nice appetizers.  With the prices in the hotel and outside nearby this perk is easily worth $175 per person/day. Drinks in the hotel bars can easily cost you $25/ea just for a beer. Breakfast you'd spend $125 for 2 at Adrift or Rise.  To top it off the service is excellent and the views are amazing. Special recognition to Vinson who was super friendly and always had a smile on his face!"
Club55,4.3,6,Buffets,5,20-Feb-19,Just below the penthouse 57 th floor hence the name is a cool place to enjoy the view and mellow music. Drinks and tapas tonight with my lady makes for a great way to end the day of sight seeing or rather food seeing
Club55,4.3,6,Buffets,4,10-Mar-19,"Had a lovely evening wine tasting and hors d'oeuvres. It's called Flight of Fancy. We had 4 different flights - red wines from the old world, reds from the new world, Japanese soju and mocktails. All pairs with yummy hors d'oeuvres. Surrounded by the beautiful views from 55 floors up of the Singapore skyline. Will definitely come again."

Whenever you feel a bit blue or a bit contemplative, simply go to Ippudo Express and get the culinary equivalent of a really, really, really high quality hug!  I've tucked in the Asa Ramen and the Aka Tonkatsu Ramen so far and both are winners! The size at Ippudo is perfect for me, not too large and not too small  The Aka Tonkatsu ($11) is the ramen that put Ippudo on the map. Rich porky tonkatsu (with ample collagen!) enhanced with miso paste and roasted garlic oil served with springy straight noodles. The piece of pork belly was perfectly cooked and fell apart in my mouth  The Asa Ramen ($9) is a special that is only served from 9a-11a...essentially, it's Ippudo's breakfast ramen! The broth is clear and light and flavored with pork, chicken and just the slightest hint of yuzu. Delicate wontons swim in the broth, their transluscent skins no less appealing than semi-sheer cotton hemlines fluttering in the breeze on a hot summer's day  Onsen Egg ($2) is absolutely perfect...I could eat these by the dozen! The yolk is slightly liquid and golden and the egg white is delicately flavored...perfect with the rich, ramen broth  PARTING THOUGHT: The line at lunch time is truly fearsome! If you are looking for a ramen fix, your best bets are breakfast (they open by 9am) or dinner...basically anything except for the 11:30a - 2p prime lunch window!"

The broth is clear and light and flavored with pork, chicken and just the slightest hint of yuzu. Delicate wontons swim in the broth, their transluscent skins no less appealing than semi-sheer cotton hemlines fluttering in the breeze on a hot summer's day  Onsen Egg ($2) is absolutely perfect...I could eat these by the dozen! The yolk is slightly liquid and golden and the egg white is delicately flavored...perfect with the rich, ramen broth  PARTING THOUGHT: The line at lunch time is truly fearsome! If you are looking for a ramen fix, your best bets are breakfast (they open by 9am) or dinner...basically anything except for the 11:30a - 2p prime lunch window!"
Ippudo,4.5,4,Ramen,4,24-Jan-14,"I was surprised to see an Ippudo Ramen Express at Asia Square Food Garden but yes, finally a ramen that is true to its convenience root. Still don't get why we should be paying 20+ 30 bucks for ramen in Singapore.  Anyway, the Shiro Tonkotsu Ramen was fantastic. Better than i would imagine a Singapore cooked Ippudo ramen. Just thinking about the chewy Hakata noodles in the slightly sweet milky broth that is perfumed with garlic is enough to make me drool! Do give it a go."

Ippudo,4.5,4,Ramen,5,6-Jan-14,"I was a skeptical and curious about the whole Ippudo in a food court concept. Having tried it I can't complain. It's Ippudo, quality is really high. And this is one of the nicer food courts in Singapore (being mostly office workers its generally cleaner and more civilized than other locations around town.)  I had the spicy again, which is becoming my Ippudo standard order. Overall a really great option for a food court. No gyoza though when I went."

Da Paolo Gastronomia - Marina Bay Sands,4.3,8,"Italian, Desserts, Coffee & Tea",5,3-Sep-19,"Did someone say dessert!? I was walking to my hotel after dinner and saw the gelato bar. Wanting a bit of a snack after work, I stopped in to learn this is so much more than just ice cream. Their pastries, bread and gluten free cakes all looked amazing.  My friend tried the gluten free cake and said it tasted too good to be flowerless. I had the salted Carmel donut and another the salted Carmel gelato. We were all highly impressed.  Beat the heat in this place and stop in for a snack!"
Da Paolo Gastronomia - Marina Bay Sands,4.3,8,"Italian, Desserts, Coffee & Tea",4,2-Aug-19,I was simply walking by and bright colors of the Gelato and the sign caught my eyes. I ordered the Parma Ham and Wild Rocket Panini and was blown away by the flavors. I really would like to come back and try one of their pastas as well. The staff is very nice and attentive. There are so many options in the establishment for such a small place and I love it. I'm definitely coming back.
Da Paolo Gastronomia - Marina Bay Sands,4.3,8,"Italian, Desserts, Coffee & Tea",3,24-Apr-13,"This was my go-to place for quick dinner during my temporary stint in The Sail. I've tried all the salads, most of the pizzas, a few pastas and deli items. While mildly over priced (for the convenience) the food quality is reliable and good enough to keep me coming back.  Salads - Would recommend the apricot chicken salad or the turkey salad. The pumpkin quinoa salad sounded good, but was pretty dry and the flavor combinations didn't really mesh. The tuna salad was just okay.  Pastas - The chicken pasta was good, but on the oily side (if you look at the bottom of the plastic container you can see beads of tomatoey oil building up). The salomon lasagna was very good (surprisingly so, was not expecting to like a seafood lasagna!) but much heavier than expected. I'm used to lasagna having tomato sauce within the layers, but the sauce with these lasagna is more of a cheesy cream sauce. Good, but heavy.  Pizzas - Smoked salmon pizza was delish. The veggie was okay, but the veggies seemed a bit off (over cooked? dried out? just been sitting out all day?). The mushroom pizza was fab, but I'm also a big mushroom fan so others may not agree.  In the deli case the broccoli had a bit too much oil (must have been a heavily oily stir fry), and wasn't at all spicy (though labeled ""spicy broccoli""). Caprese was good, and seafood salad nice and light.  Lastly, pass on the cupcakes. You can make better ones with a box mix. If you have an oven, that is..."
Da Paolo Gastronomia - Marina Bay Sands,4.3,8,"Italian, Desserts, Coffee & Tea",4,2-Mar-16,"I eat here once or twice a week because I live and work in the area. The girl who works there always greets me by name, which is really sweet, and the service is always quick. Their food is good, not great, but there are some favorites of mine. The mushroom pizza is really good, I could probably have a slice every day. The chicken and brie sandwich is also a hit, and their desserts are very nice. The little puddings, and chocolate souflees-YUM! The pastas I wasn't impressed with, and a lot of the by weight salads are expensive. That's my only real complaint, dinner will run you about $20 per person. Kind of hard to stomach when I could just walk across the street ot the hawker. But solid choices if you are in a hurry."
Da Paolo Gastronomia - Marina Bay Sands,4.3,8,"Italian, Desserts, Coffee & Tea",4,23-Oct-12,"A pretty simple food stall with sandwiches and pasta options. They have a bunch of them all over Singapore, so it does not warrant philisophical musings like so many people do reviewing Starbucks or McDonald's.  I ordered the Parma ham and enmental cheese on focaccia ($13) which was delicious. Not the largest sandwich in the world, but a good amount of ham, cheese and greens. Worth checking out the pastas."
Da Paolo Gastronomia - Marina Bay Sands,4.3,8,"Italian, Desserts, Coffee & Tea",5,31-Jul-18,Great little Pizza and pasta place in the marina bay sands mall. Service and customer service was great and the staff was very friendly. The pizza is really good. It's a great place for a quick bite for lunch. We were traveling from America and Pizza was so good we made several stops at this place during our stay.
Da Paolo Gastronomia - Marina Bay Sands,4.3,8,"Italian, Desserts, Coffee & Tea",4,27-Jan-15,I'm a fan of this chain! Less allergen information listed then some of the other locations but you can still find some gluten free or dairy free options of that is your concern. Great location to grab a coffee and go for a stroll along the water.
Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",5,17-Jun-24,"Came here on a 36hr trip to Singapore. This hawker ""stall"" is near/in Chinatown and is relatively easy to find. We came by metro, used google maps and had no issues finding it.  We arrived around lunch time, and while there is a line and tables that appear to be full, folks are quick to clear out. Food order to collection is very quick and the tables are large so that they can accommodate larger parties, or a few smaller ones.  The food was great. The chicken was moist and the rice was delicious. It doesn't seem like it is a lot of food, but neither myself or my husband were able to finish our meals.  Do yourself a favor and visit this place when you're in the area!"

Hawker Chan is well known to have been the first hawker stall to earn a Michelin Star in 2016.  We ended up getting the soy sauce chicken plate with egg noodles and a side of pork ribs to try. The soy sauce chicken was great - super soft and we loved the texture of the chicken skin. The pork ribs dare I say were even better - super texture and all off the bone! We only got a side of pork ribs which were 2 additional Singaporean dollars but wish we got more.  Surprisingly enough, the best part of the plate was the noodles! It was soaked in the delicious, silky sauce and at first I was a bit put off by the amount of oil on the plate but once you mix the sauce/oil with the noodles, the combination is perfection! Chewy noodles with an umami, rich sauce I could eat just the noodles themselves.  Definitely worth a stop if you're in Singapore - it lives up to the hype!"

I've had soy sauce chicken all my life and you can find it everywhere in Chinese BBQ places and restaurants. I found Hawker Chan's version to be sweeter and the chicken meat consistently moist and smooth. Rice was perfectly cooked too, and was enhanced by that wonderful soya sauce.

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",5,20-Jan-24,"What: soya sauce chicken / Cantonese BBQ  Worth all the hype from its Michelin awards (formerly one star, now Bib Gourmand). Stellar!  First, hawker center dining:  1. Most are long lived businesses that make one thing well and take pride in their accolades. 2. Longest lines regardless of tourist mix equals good eats. 3. Generally, higher prices for the same item mean MORE of the key item (from a noodle vendor this means more noodles not more toppings). 4. For popular spots, go at or before opening. 5. Reserve a table by leaving anything (ie pack of tissues or umbrella) on it BUT be willing to share vacant seats with others. Feel free to ask others to sit at their table. 6. Bus and clean your table / space. It's the law.  IMPORTANT: Hawker center portions are much smaller than US portions. Don't expect to get full from just one dish. Makes sense as we Americans are two to three times the size (weight) of the average Singaporean.  It looks like any other Chinese BBQ eatery. There is nothing ordinary about it. The signature soya sauce chicken, outstanding. Slightly dry for braised chicken by Western standards but the flavor is incredible, brimming with sweet soy, ginger, anise, cinnamon, all the classic flavors of Cantonese BBQ but amplified. The braising liquid is reduced and is the perfect ""sauce"" for the chicken rice or very chewy egg noodles. Add some sambal belachan here and there for some spice kick. Either carb works.  Add a two or three type platter (meat selections) because you can. Excellent crispy skin roast pork with just the right amount of fat and BBQ pork beautifully charred from burning castoffs. The bitterness adds huge complexity.  Long line but moves extremely fast.  Great eats!"

This location that we visited on Smith Street is just across from the original stand with air conditioning and ample seating. I was excited to not be in the hot, humidity inside the hawker center but we did go across the way to check it out. As we got into line, it moved quickly. We ordered two of the soy sauce chicken and rice plates along with a Tiger beer. It literally is the cheapest Michelin starred meal you can try in the world. I know they lost their star a few years ago, but the recipe is the same so I'm not going to nitpick. We were given a number and we went to find seating at a nearby table. Our number was called, so I went to collect the food. You're given the tray but it's up to you to collect the utensils, chili sauce, pickled jalapenos, and napkins, etc. We dug in. The chicken was tender and seasoned well. The chili sauce was fire! I liked it a lot. Was it as good as they say? It was good but not great. I didn't enjoy it as much as the Tian Tian Hainanese chicken and rice we had at the Maxwell hawker center but it was still good. I'm partial to Hainanese chicken and rice versus the soy sauce version so that's where I am biased. I have to say, while the place was busy, it was run efficiently and it was clean. I know they got crazy with the expansions and franchises but I hope they concentrate on the quality of the food moving forward. I'm glad we got to try this spot.

It is located in a mall, so feel free to do some of your shopping here while enjoying the air conditioning. It is like a food court so it has a good selection of juices to go along with your meal!

Roasted chicken with crispy skin was juicy, The skin on pork was very crunchy. I'm still trying to recover from intense mouthgasm after I left the restaurant."

Fortunately, there wasn't a long line when I came, so I got my meal almost immediately after ordering up front. I ordered the cha siew & chicken with rice and it KIND OF tasted like what I've already had before. The cha siew and chicken were cooked well, the chicken was tender, and the soy sauce was SWEEEET, so it's a bit different than what I've had; I think honey might be in the marinade recipe. I prefer the cha siew over the chicken because the flavoring was bomb, but the entire meal was very satisfying for me.  The reviews here are mixed but I actually enjoy and appreciate simple + affordable foods and that's exactly what Chef Chan's belief is. I'm pretty glad a non-expensive nor fancy fine-dining restaurant like simple Hawker Chan received a Michelin star. It's worth checking out and I don't know why you wouldn't want to spend less than USD$3 for a meal, because honestly, what can that get you especially in America? NOTHING.  I personally RECOMMEND!"

There are so many other things I would rather eat for the same amount of money (around $5 singapore dollars).  Not worth the trek."

Probably one of the best meals I've ever had especially when it comes down to about $5 U.S. a meal.  - Soya sauce chicken w/ rice - this must be the tastiest chicken I've ever had, especially their skin. Whatever they marinated would definitely has a Touch of Magic. Only complaint is that they do it the inexpensive way which is just directly butcher the chicken so you have a lot of Bones to go through 4/5 - char siew hor fun - incredibly flavorful. Hard to be disappointed with such an explosion of flavor and the meat was cooked to perfection - aiyu aloe vera - super super refreshing. The jelly tastes like chrysanthemum with chunks of aloe. I highly recommend getting this with any of their dishes. I think it's the perfect palate cleanser at the end of extremely hearty flavors  Although I only have a few days out here, definitely going to make a second stop before I leave. A must & absolutely worth it"

Not only is Singapore a dope vacation destination, but it has cheap, delicious food. With numerous and cheap Michelin-starred restaurants. It's cool that this restaurant is in Chinatown, so you can shop and continue your food journey while in Singapore.  After waiting in the line that was literally out the door (roughly 20 minutes), I ordered the soya chicken and rice, which is what gave this place its Michelin star. When I finally received my food (about 10 minutes later), I struggled for a few minutes finding a table. This place is packed! Seriously, good luck finding a seat, as people tend to ""save"" them for their multiple person families. Kinda rude, but smart.  I will say that the chicken was good, but not very unique and definitely not worth the wait. It was roasted chicken, rice with soya sauce, half a boiled egg, fresh slices of cucumber, and roasted peanuts. Super random items and plating, but I suppose when they are churning out hundreds-plus plates a day they could care less. There are tons of other hawkers that serve the same food and you'll get it in 5 minutes without a wait.  Suggestions: Take your food to go and go sit on a bench or in the food court nearby to eat it. It'll save you time and energy from wrestling for seats with other foreigners. Or, if you just want to try the dish, go to any hawker stall."

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",5,27-Nov-19,"I had just gone to Maxwell Hawker Center at 10 am to try the Hainan Chicken Rice at Tian Tian, then decided to walk through Chinatown to try the Soya Sauce Chicken at Hawker Chan. It was a short walk, but I stopped several times to buy souvenirs. I got to Hawker Chan around 10:45 am, and there were about 6 people waiting in line. It was early and the restaurant was fairly empty, and the line moved quickly.  I had to try their famous soya sauce chicken that won them their Michelin star, and boy was it good! The skin reminded me of the skin from a roast chicken or duck. It's better than most of the soya sauce chickens I've had in San Francisco. The sauce is a mix between savory and sweet. I feel that most of the soya sauce chickens at home were mostly salty, and one dimensional. The Hawker Chan chicken was moist and juicy. Portion size is on the smaller side, but I wasn't too hungry after already eating at Tian Tian about an hour earlier.  I also ordered the green papaya with pork ribs soup, fried dumplings, and a Chinese flower tea. My entire meal came out to $18.80 SGD. The chicken was only $5 SGD (about $3.67 USD in November 2019). It's insane. There is no way I could get a chicken rice plate for under $4 in San Francisco, much less at a Michelin star restaurant.  Definitely a must-try if you're in Singapore."

There is limited space and we all want to eat our food and go ^-^  Eats: Roast Chicken Soya Noodle 5/5 Savory, tender, and moist. Probably one of the best versions I've had of this dish. Definitely good and well worth the price. The noodles are also well worth mentioning here. They are soft but still chewy! Delicious with just a bit of the ""BBQ chashu sauce"" that comes on the side. Roast Pork Rice 5/5 I actually enjoyed this much more then the chicken. As a kid I loved roast pork more then roast chicken simply out of laziness haha no bones versus bones! Haha so I do have good memories with this dish. However Hawker Chan's roast pork is different in that you can really taste the spices in a good way. It's extremely aromatic for something that is usually so simple. *Note: Hot sauce, soy sauce, and chilis are available directly to the left of the pick up station. This is also where you get your chopsticks and spoon.  Overall would definitely return even with the price hikes given it's new location and fancy ordering system because it's still a destination and achieved something never done before."

Overall would definitely return even with the price hikes given it's new location and fancy ordering system because it's still a destination and achieved something never done before."
Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",4,24-Feb-19,"Going to a hawker stall converted to a one star Michelin restaurant puts a lot of pressure on the restaurant. It's clear that there's only one thing you really order there, and it's the soy sauce chicken. The real question is do you get a half chicken or 2 chicken with rice.  We opted for the option that maximized this heralded bird. The order seems to be streamlined quite well and they called our number within 5 minutes of ordering. It was really good. Was it worthy of a michelin star....I don't know about that. Was it worth 7 bucks, **** yea it was. There was no piece that wasn't juicy, tender, and soft. If you're familiar with Costco chicken, think like 5 times more tender without any notion of strands of meat. I honestly have no idea how it's possible to be this perfect. Normally you have to fight for the red meat, but this chicken was just perfect everywhere. No discrimination! The soy sauce complemented it well and obviously went well with the chicken. It didn't seem fatty at all either, so seems like a dish I could eat every day of the week.  If you start getting familiar with hawker costs, you realize this place is double the price of other chicken, is it twice as good, probably not. Would I go here vs other ones with limited time? No question."

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",4,18-Jun-18,"This review is for the actual Liao Fan Hong Kong food stall (now known as Hawker Chan) instead of the Hawker Chan restaurant which opened after the Michelin Star was earned. Yelp is a bit confusing in that reviewers are posting reviews for both locations on multiple businesses which all have different addresses.  The food stall is located on the second floor of the Chinatown Complex, which is across the street from the air conditioned sit-down restaurant. The reason I chose to eat at the stall is because the prices are cheaper and the food is ""supposedly"" better. Also, if I'm going to come all the way here - it's better to eat at the original right? (Especially since Hawker Chain restaurant chains are now popping up all over the world).  The soya sauce chicken noodle is the dish that earned this place a Michelin Star. At the stall it is S$2.50 (super cheap for a Michelin Star meal!) I also ordered a char siew rice which was also $2.50. There are some other menu items that also looked delicious like the soya sauce chicken rice, roasted pork rice, and the chicken hor fun. Most dishes are S$3 and under.  Let me start off by saying the meal was definitely good. The chicken was very tender and juicy. The noodles were cooked well. I love that they poured their delicious sauces all over my plate. Was it amazing? I'm not sure. There are a lot of other stalls in the area serving the same exact dish and most of them are also really delicious. I'm not sure what makes the chicken stand out. The char siew, however, was really good - I liked it more than the chicken.  Overall, I think my expectations were too high because of this place's popularity and its star. The only reason we came here was to try the ""cheapest Michelin Star meal in the world"". I'm not sure if I would come here again and wait in the really long line. Comparing this place to other one Michelin Star restaurants I would give it a four star (good food at a very cheap price). Comparing this place to other Hawker stalls I would give it a five star."

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",3,2-Apr-23,"I went and waited in line for the restaurant to open, I was really excited. When inside, the ordering process is really efficient. When you finish ordering your food you go and select your table and wait until your order number shows up on a large number screen. I ordered the Soya Sauce Chicken Rice and the Braised Meats dish. Your dish looks just like the pictures on the menu, but this is where the whole experience changed for me as the chicken had more bones than meat, which made it very difficult to eat and the flavor just wasn't there, pretty bland. The rice tasted really good, but not as mind blowing as you would expect from a Michelin rated restaurant. The braised meat was also mostly bones and it seemed more boiled than braised, oddly there was a large portion of Tofu which was probably the best thing on the plate. It was really cool experience to search out this spot, but just not a good fit for me! I would recommend trying it for yourself!"

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",4,9-Dec-17,"Hawker Chan is a great ""cheap"" eat for being on the Michelin list. Their claim to fame is their soy sauce chicken, which I tried. The chicken was tender, juicy, and flavorful that paired well with plain white rice. I came on a Sunday morning around 11:30am, no line and easily found seating. I recommend using their electronic kiosk to order because that seems to be faster than ordering with the cashier. The kiosk accepts cash and credit cards, prints a receipt at the end to get your meal.  I also ordered the bean sprouts, which I thought were too salty. The portions are plentiful for 2 people. Staff seems to work quickly to clear and clean tables. Overall, my experience was good, but I wasn't totally blown away."

A good indication that you've found it is: the longest line in the entire Hawker Center!  You place your order, find a table, and enjoy your meal - or take yours to-go. There's a charge for to-go containers.  If you want the full experience and you're not the whiny type, come here. Otherwise, go to the air conditioned version across the street and pay extra for the slight convenience.  I've tried their soya chicken, char siew, roasted pork, rice, and noodles. My favorite was the roasted pork - it's everything that's good with Chinese roasted pork. De-li-cious! The noodles tend to get cold quick so you might want to take a quick pic of your food for Instagram and eat right away."

To the foreigners that complain about ""the Chicken was all bones"" - welcome to Asia where chickens aren't on steroids and growth hormones. This is what normal chickens are like. You shouldn't even be in Singapore!  For about 5.50SGD, you get your protein (chicken, char siew, roasted pork or ribs) + carbs (rice or noodles) + soya. You can also add more protein for about 2.50SGD. Or be an oinker like me and pay 10.50SGD for the 3-meat combo with a carb.  I've eaten here and at Hawker Chan several times while I was in Singapore. I've tried their soya sauce chicken, char siew, roasted pork, rice, and noodles. They're all good but the menu item that I always get was the roasted pork. It's meaty, not super fatty, and the skin is crunchy good. The chicken is flavorful and tender.  Pay attention to your ticket number so you're not that clueless tourist slowing down the process and harassing the employees when your food is going to be ready. In the dining area, there's a TV where you can watch Chan Hon Meng's Michelin story and on the side is the ticket number they're serving.

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",4,29-Mar-20,Get your fix from a Michelin star cook. The chicken is superb. Order a whole dark sauced chicken and slowly dip in the sauce to savor the taste. The meat is tender and cooked just right. Compliment it with a plate of noodles cooked to perfection. Go early or the chicken runs out. 4 starts for me.

Not sure if it was because of what they thought of the food or if it was because of the drastic price increase after receiving the Michelin star. We arrived about 30 mins before they opened and found ourselves at the front of the line. It wasn't until 10 mins before the shop opened that the line started to get long. It took around 10 mins before we were called to the counter to pick up the food. Grabbed some condiments and headed to a table.  Ended up ordering half a chicken, a bowl of rice, rice noodles, and an order of bean sprouts. The chicken was super tender and even the breast meat was super tender and all pieces of chicken were flavorful. What sets this soy sauce chicken apart from all of the rest is with how well seasoned the chicken is and the unique flavor of the soy sauce they use. It is evident in with their dark soy sauce they offer as a condiment as it has a smokiness to it. The only complaint I have was with the bean sprouts. Wished they cooked it longer as I personally don't like the taste of raw bean sprouts.  I would definitely recommend this place as the soy sauce chicken did live up to the hype.

Get the veggies, it's simple yet one of the best I've ever had. I'm going to say that the biggest difference I taste in this chicken is the soy sauce they use. I think that's their secret. They pour it onto your rice too, so flavorful. The chicken itself is tender as can be, not one dry piece. I'm still dreaming about it.

You order/pickup from the counter and all seating is self-seating. Although there's plenty of seats, it took some time to find a seat for 2 because it was so crowded.  My boyfriend and I each ordered their famous soya chicken and rice dish. I ordered the roasted pork with noodles and the bf ordered the chair siu with noodles. My take on each dish:  -Soya chicken and rice: The chicken was tender, but a little dry. I ended getting a portion with a ton of bones, whereas my bf said his was boneless. The rice was cold and hard - blegh! Was disappointed with this dish.  -Roast pork with noodle: I enjoyed this dish more than the soya chicken dish. The noodles were tasty and the pork skin had a nice crunch to it.  The bf said he liked the char siu dish with noodles.  Worth a try, but I didn't understand the hype. Maybe it's just this location?

Food is prepared quickly but generally you will need to share a table with a stranger and have someone standing over you waiting for you to finish. It's not worth the hassle in my opinion. It's located on the bustling food street in Chinatown and there are tons of other options.

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",3,3-Sep-17,"Another questionable Michelin star. Given the price we paid (approx $12 for 2 people) I didn't expect mind blowing food. But I felt that this wasn't that different to other soy sauce chicken places that I've been. The chicken was slightly better than average, and the rice was really mediocre.  Fortunely the wait was only like 20min (Saturday around 3pm). If I had to wait an hour+, I would've given it 2 stars.  It was worth trying though just to be able to claim that you've had such a cheap Michelin star meal."

So to start it had alot of bones, the chicken was cooked well, not dry at all, the flavor was very generic, I tasted the soya sauce and it wasn't anything impressive.

As a Cantonese I pretty much grew up eating roasted meats and chicken and I have to say the food quality was underwhelming. The chicken wasn't really tender and actually somewhat dry. Same thing goes with the roasted pork: there could have been more layering with the lean and fatty parts so the meat isn't too dry. You can't beat the price of $5 but honestly there are so many hawkers in Singapore that offer much cheaper and flavorful options.  The seating/lining up situation was also very hectic given that there were a lot of people trying to find seats with trays of food in their hands in a very cramped space. It was an interesting experience given the chain's fame but honestly I wouldn't be back."

It wasn't too crazy busy when we went to eat, was still a tad early for the lunch-run I supposed.  The noodle was perfectly done and the star of the show: the soya chicken...man the meat just melts in your mouth. Perfectly seasoned and tender to consume. I was in soya-chicken heaven. Which is why we went back the next day (Tuesday 11am) and just ordered half a chicken! It's was damn delicious to not go back for seconds!!  Other than the soya chicken, the roasted pork and bbq pork (char siew) were also delicious. The choice of meat used for cooking enhances the flavour and tenderness of the finished product. The two pork dishes will not disappoint as they stand their ground against the soya chicken."

Of course, I also have heard of this place because of the Michelin guide and it being the first hawker stall receiving a coveted star.  I had to try it all - the soya chicken, the char siew, the roasted pork, and more. I had the soya chicken plate with the rice ($3.80 SGD) and the 3 way platter which comes with the char siew, roasted pork, and the pork rib ($10 SGD). It was amazing. You could really taste how different the soy sauce brew is, in comparison to other restaurants. The sauce is sweeter than most but with a very unique spice floral undertone. The char siew was amazing as well because of that unique soy sauce brew. The roasted pork is like any other in SG so you can totally skip this because I think they just have this, just to have people order it.  This place is crowded on the weekends and getting a table inside is quite difficult so to avoid the chaos, the best thing to do is order your food as take out and bring it with you to the nearby Chinatown Food Street. Tons of outdoor seating during the lunch time and you can enjoy the meal without tons of people surrounding you as they queue or wait for you to leave and take your seat.  This place wins for the price and their awesome product. This guy from the US will be back for sure."

They were good...but if this is Michelin star, I know other places that deserve the star too then. Service was very quick though and the price might be cheaper than other restaurants that isn't Michelin star.  We also had the seasonal vegetable which at the time was gailan.

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",5,14-Jun-18,"It's now called Hawker Chan (per the sign, ""Formerly known as Liao Fan Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle""). You won't find a cheaper Michelin-rated eating establishment anywhere in the world. For the famous See Yao Gai Fan (soy sauce chicken rice), it's S$2. With the current exchange rate, that's about $1.50 USD- it's pretty much free then. The chicken itself is fantastic- definitely higher quality than what your typical HK BBQ shop would offer. The chicken here is plump and succulent with gushing taste. Another thing, I'm surprised that no one talks about the char siew. This breaks into my personal top 3 char siew experiences. It's got a perfect balance between meat, fat, oiliness, marinate, and sweetness- it just melts inside your mouth and the outside has a good burnt char appeal. If you get the chicken rice, I strongly recommend the char siew as a side. They actually open at 10am, and regardless of the day of the week, there's going to be a long line.  The original location, where you can see the owner, is found in the Chinatown Complex Food Court. There's another Hawker Chan restaurant set-up outside on Smith Street, which for some reason, has the same offerings but at a premium. Not sure what that's all about, but your best bet is to just go to the actual original hawker in the food court. Anyways, for what you're paying and what you get, this place is great! Man man sik.  Oh, and one more thing.. the owner is actually not a Singaporean. He's Malaysian from Ipoh."

I should've skipped the char siew because it had bones in it and the chicken rice was more than enough. Just enough fat but not too much to take away from the juicy flavor. I just wish it had a little more meat in it, but that's because I'm used to the larger portions in general in the US.

My wife ordered the famous soy chicken and rice while I got the meat combination platter. Normally my wife isn't a fan of soy chicken, but she said this one was exceptional. The chicken was moist and the rice with sauce was a perfect accompaniment.  I ordered noodles to go with my combo platter of meat (Char Siu, roast pork, and roast duck). The Char Asia was by far the best piece of meat on the plate. The roast pork and duck were also good, but nothing stand out. The sauce with the noodles was really good on not too salty  Overall a great meal for a great price. Really glad we got a chance to eat here."

You're going to wait in line during the busy and off hours. The line and turnover is very quick. Once you place your order, be sure to look for a place to sit during this time. The seats fill up fast, so look around to see which parties are almost done with their meal and ask them.  Now to the main entree. This soya chicken is so juicy and flavorful in every bite. From the skin to the chicken meat, it was a delicious experience to throw down on. I recommend getting the half chicken instead of the regular size. The regular size just feels to little with the amount of chicken compared to the above average amount of rice they give. Besides, the half chicken won't break the bank either."

You're going to wait in line during the busy and off hours. The line and turnover is very quick. Once you place your order, be sure to look for a place to sit during this time. The seats fill up fast, so look around to see which parties are almost done with their meal and ask them.  Now to the main entree. This soya chicken is so juicy and flavorful in every bite. From the skin to the chicken meat, it was a delicious experience to throw down on. I recommend getting the half chicken instead of the regular size. The regular size just feels to little with the amount of chicken compared to the above average amount of rice they give. Besides, the half chicken won't break the bank either."

We ordered the famous soya chicken with rice and then a crispy roast pork with noodles and shared it among 3 of us. The sauce was really good, the chicken super moist and flavorful. Recommend it for sure if you're in Singapore!"

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",5,12-Jan-18,"This restaurant is famous for its ""cheap Michelin star chicken rice"". This chicken differs from all other stores in its tenderness and seasoning. (Very tender and juicy, flavourful and balanced taste) Another one of their specialties is the red sauce that they serve with the chicken rice. This is my favorite part of the meal; the sauce is sweet, tangy not too spicy! It contains a lot of flavour without coming off as too strong or too rich. The rice is drizzled with a mysterious black sauce with a sweet aftertaste, I normally don't eat rice but by the end of the meal, I had devoured most of it! Definitely recommend this place, the pricing is reasonable for the portion size."

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",3,3-Nov-19,"The soy sauce chicken and rice was good, but it wasn't that much better than what I can get back home. The most notable aspects are that the chicken is really moist and the price is cheap. The serving is small - barely more than a chicken leg and a portion of the thigh. It came with about a rice bowl worth of rice.  I also ordered the char siu noodles based on all the other reviews. Again nothing that special in either the roast pork or the noodles.  Finally, they didn't have any napkins - so bring something to wipe your hands.  It's worth checking out, but don't set your expectations too high."

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",4,12-Jun-17,"I had heard of how a food stall had earned a Michelin star, so we wanted to check it out when I was in Singapore. I was a little confused when my googling brought us to this location that was clearly not a little stall, but instead a newer location opened up after the success of the stall. We weren't sure if we should just eat here, or go find the original stall.  A little research brought me the following information (I can't guarantee it is all true since I didn't actually go to the stall): +the food tastes pretty much the same at both places +the food is more expensive in this store +there is a much longer wait at the original stall (and no AC!)  After weighing the cost/benefits (the big one being AC), we decided it wasn't worth it to try and find the original stall.  So we got in line and ordered: +Soya Sauce Chicken Rice ($3.80): a simple dish, but the chicken was actually really delicious! The meat was tender and full of flavor. The soy sauce flavored rice was also simple, but a good addition. +Pork Rib Noodle ($5.00): the sauce was on the sweeter side, with the option of mixing in the spicy sauce (I didn't). The pork rib was probably my favorite of the pork meats we tried. +2 Combination Platter (Char Siew and Roasted Pork) ($6.00): I wasn't too impressed with the meats as they were both quite dry and not that flavorful. +Seasonal Vegetable ($5.00): pretty basic dish, but helps to keep the meat from being too overwhelming. Nothing amazing, but it was done well. +Roselle Tea ($2.00): this tastes a lot like suan mei tang (not sure of the English name). It is sweet and tart (similar to cranberries maybe?). Im personally not a huge fan.  The food was good, and I left feeling satisfied without needing to break the wallet. That being said, is there probably better food out there? Very likely so, but at least you can have bragging rights about eating at a Michelin star restaurant! I would definitely recommend trying it at least once if you're in the Chinatown area."

I waited about 40 minutes before ordering, but once you order, you get your order within 1 - 3 minutes. Worth the wait? Debatable, but more on the yes side. I think it's worthwhile for anyone that has to time to try, to try. I mean, this is super affordable for anyone who's looking to try a Michelin star restaurant for no more than $2/3 USD per item.  The soya chicken is super fragrant and cooked perfectly moist and tender, but nothing that was out of the ordinary as I've had many similar items in Hong Kong. I didn't particularly like the sambal or the red sauce that was on the side with my egg noodles. Meh, I'd just stick to the chicken and rice. We also got the char siu with rice, and again pretty disappointing. It was too crispy on the outside (very charred) and too salty/fatty for my liking. Sauce over the rice was good though. Soya chicken and rice is the way to go."

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",5,7-Feb-17,"I will start off by saying I'm from the states and had to try Soya Chicken from the revered cheapest Michelin starred restaurant in the world. Soya chicken from my hometown is so... dry that I would never order it, so my thought was how can chicken get better.. especially to the point that it deserves a star.  If you want the full-on experience, you must go to the original hawker stand on the 2nd floor of the building across the street, but it usually has a longer line and opens later than the new chain restaurant opened on Smith Street. Also, if you are price conscious while on vacation, the stand is cheaper:  - Soya Chicken Dish At Stand - $2.50 At Franchise - $3.80  - Half a Chicken At Stand - $7 At Franchise - $12  We tried both places and think the food is pretty comparable. The franchise is more to make money from tourists for the investment firm that approached the chef (I believe the chef gets 30% of profits or 30% share of the business). You can get angry at the price difference, but you got to give the man props. Now, he'll actually make money for about the same amount of work.  My group also tried several of the Soya chicken stands in the area, and they do not compare. For me, its all in the texture and flavor. The chicken is tender while succulent and reminds me of roast duck, but with the heavy flavor of soy sauce. Delicious!  I'd definitely recommend the trying either location. But this one has A/C for all you tourists out there like me!"

See Yelp link here: https://www.yelp.com/biz/hong-kong-soya-sauce-chicken-rice-and-noodle-singapore?utm_source=ishare&utm_medium=s_nb_i_f  We chose to try this restaurant as it just opened Nov 2016, and I've got to say that the soy sauce chicken is superb. It is nice that it is air conditioned as well.  We got there and the queue was not that long outside but when we left it snaked around and was on the street out of the queue barriers.  There is a queue outside the door, and they let you in in bunches so you don't overwhelm the kitchen and ordering. You either order at the counter register or get helped by someone at the ordering machine as well. Both seems effective and decently orderly.  You order, pay, get a number, then, grab your seat. Your number gets called and you pick up your order. Utensils, hot sauce, straws, chilis, are self service too.  The neat thing is Chef Chan was there putting out the food from the kitchen too.  There is a variety of menu combinations or alacarte you can choose from but basically soy sauce chicken, char siew (BBQ pork), roast pork, roast pork ribs. Then there is rice, wonton noodles, hor fun (wide flat rice noodles). Then veggies and drinks.  We ordered a full chicken (S$23), 2 combination meat of char siew and roast pork (S$6), rice (.8) and wonton noodles (1.5), and two drinks. We basically had leftover chicken and a few pieces of the others but we knew that'd happen.  Overall, as expected, soy sauce chicken their specialty, was by far the best. One of the best soy sauce chickens I've ever had. Weakest was the roast pork in my opinion but still good.  Because of the air conditioning, the wonton noodles (which are served dry with the soy sauce chicken sauce on it) didn't stay as warm as I'd like but still was good. The rice with the sauce was good with the chicken too.  I'd recommend stopping by and queuing for this whether it be the restaurant or hawker if you're in Singapore. Given that it's S$3.80 (around $2.50 usd) It is super affordable and yummy.  FYI/ hawker stall info is in the link above and very near the restaurant is: Hawker Stall: Blk 335, Smith Street #02-126, Chinatown Food Complex, Singapore 050335 Opening Hours: 10:30am to 7:00pm (Mon - Tues, Thurs - Fri), 8:30am to 7:00pm (Sat - Sun), Closed Wed  Tip/ cash, credit, nets which is great for versatility of payment Tip2/ must try the soy sauce chicken Tip3/ very near the Chinatown MRT (purple North-east line) I believe exit A toward smith street is the proper exit."

Aside from the char siew, everything else especially the chicken rice was subpar and overrated.  I've had way better chicken rice in Malaysia at various hawker stalls. The chaw siew was the saving grace, but there are much better options in Malaysia as well. Really disappointed but at least there wasn't a long wait for the food."

I love soy sauce chicken. I don't like white meat and always prefer the dark. That being said, this is the best soysauce chicken I've ever had in my lifetime thus far. Ever since I left singapore I've been craving it so much. It left such a strong impression on me that I now refuse to order soysauce chicken back home because I know I'll be disappointed. The chicken is so so so so tender!!! I ate the white meat, yes the white meat and it was juicy and moist!!! The one place I don't mind eating white meat chicken instead of dark! That says a lot for me. Also the soya is sweet and savory. They pour the same sauce over with your rice or noodle. I do wish they gave a little more chicken though. After my first visit, I had to go back and get half a chicken.  I also got a side order of the roasted pork and the Cha siu. Each time I've ordered these, they were always very flavorful and juicy. The pork was super crispy and the burnt ends of the cha siu were delicious.  Now I'm salivating and hungry and craving all this as I finish my review.  P.S I also enjoyed the pickled chili peppers from the condiments section. I'd come back to Singapore just for the chicken."

I ate the white meat, yes the white meat and it was juicy and moist!!! The one place I don't mind eating white meat chicken instead of dark! That says a lot for me. Also the soya is sweet and savory. They pour the same sauce over with your rice or noodle. I do wish they gave a little more chicken though. After my first visit, I had to go back and get half a chicken.  I also got a side order of the roasted pork and the Cha siu. Each time I've ordered these, they were always very flavorful and juicy. The pork was super crispy and the burnt ends of the cha siu were delicious.  Now I'm salivating and hungry and craving all this as I finish my review.  P.S I also enjoyed the pickled chili peppers from the condiments section. I'd come back to Singapore just for the chicken."
Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",5,12-Nov-19,"Apart from the waiting time soy sauce chicken pretty good. Soft and succulent. Well balanced sauce salty and sweet. Wish the green chili was a little crunchier and that would have been perfect. Noodles are done just right so all good there. Will be back for sure but probably at even a better time. 30mins a little too long a wait. Oh yes, don't bother trying the BBQ porks as there are better else where Stick to what they are good at Soy Sauce Chicken."

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",3,15-Jan-17,"I would have regretted it if I left Singapore without coming, but I definitely can't see myself recommending it to anyone with the hot long wait and mediocre food. Maybe I got very unlucky though  Food: I ordered the basic rice and chicken combo, added some roast pork and a flower tea for S$7.80 total.  Soy sauce chicken was more of a sweet style and lacked any real depth of soy sauce flavor or savoriness. You could tell than there were aromatics in the braising liquid like orange peel. The chicken was tender but almost to a gelatinous, slippery feel and the chicken flavor was masked significantly by the sweetness of the sauce. The hot sauce is also quite sweet and not really worth using.  Roast pork was cut into nice small pieces and had a fairly good ratio of lean meat, to juicy meat, to crackling did lack a bit of crispness- it was a bit more of a stale crunch, but still decent.  The sauce on the chicken isn't just regular soy but you can taste the seasonings from the braising process which is nice.  The tea has too much sugar and not enough flower- would not recommend.   Service/Experience: Staff is woefully unprepared which is why everything is so slow. The kitchen is actually very fast and all the food is ready to go but the actual point of sale system seems to be flawed and this is why the wait is so damn long. One cashier started taking my order but was abruptly stopped by someone else. One of the cashiers doubles to clean the dining room and let in the next batch of customers. I recommend coming back in a few months when hopefully the service improves."

But I really appreciate some of the most down-to-earth restaurants that have gotten a Michelin star. For example, I gladly went to one in Hong-Kong. And in Singapore this Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice & Noodle spot is sorely unassuming, but it must be doing something right to receive that star. The reviews are so mixed, it bewildered me. There are a lot of folks who like it and many who do not and call it overhyped.  I ordered, I felt like, the signature dish on the menu. Yes, surely the classic soy sauce chicken. That's their claim to fame dish and they would sell this dish at their first stall for 2 SG dollar a plate. Later they raised the price to SG$3.80, but the extra cost goes into the overhead like the air conditioning, nice seating, etc. So essentially it's still a SG$2 Michelin star meal. The chicken looked beautiful, the colour looked right, there was a bunch of sauce in the rice itself along with some soy beans. The rice was fluffy and tasty, the sauce's taste was uniquely sweet and much deeper than just mere soy sauce. As for the chicken, it's highly tender white meat, neither dry nor juicy. All in all, worth it notwithstanding long lines!"

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",2,20-Oct-17,"I rated this place 3-star in TripAdvisor for this reason: ""Had the description of 2-star rating isn't 'Poor' but 'Below Average', I would have rated it as 2 stars.""  Originally, I wanted to visit the 1 Michelin star rated Liao Fan HK Chicken Rice stall located at the Chinatown Food Complex opposite this shop. However unexpectedly, it was closed (on a Tuesday). So I'm left with no choice but to try this ""branch"" with a lower rating of mere Bib Gourmand.  The experience was nothing short of a MAJOR disappointment.  My original intention was to simply write: - Save as to the truly tenderness of chicken, nothing is special. - The chicken is flavour-less. - The soy sauce put on top of the rice does not make it taste different, just normal soy sauce. - Chilli sauce provided is a little weird in taste. - Add-on Roasted Pork is dry, although the skin is indeed crispy. - Food servers at the food collection counter has a TERRIBLE attitude problem, they cannot be bothered to wait for a mere 10-15 seconds of walking time from table seated to the counter but will simply spam and abuses the bell. Extremely rude in manners, simply ""swing"" the tray to your direction, instead of placing it still for your collection.  I will not revisit this shop. However, I might still try Hawker Chan's chicken rice at the original shop in the food complex. Let's hope by the real man doing the dishes himself, all these Quality Control defects can be eliminated and I get to enjoy a truly amazing plate of chicken rice.  Note: - Always try to visit the stall at second floor Chinatown Food Complex and only take this shop as a backup plan. - The stall opens at 10.00 a.m., multiple reviews suggests that you can avoid the queue by being there at 9.45 a.m. The same reviews suggest that their chicken might be sold out as early as 1 p.m. - According to Michelin's website, they are closed on Wednesdays. - If you're coming straight from Changi Airport, apparently the faster way of getting to this shop was to disembark at Outram Park MRT Station (East West Line) rather than Chinatown MRT Station.  Visited 10 October 2017. Food ordered: Soya Sauce Chicken Rice (SGD 3.80), add-on Roasted Pork (SGD 3.00) - Major disappointment. Ordinary chicken rice."

In case you don't know, Singaporean's consider this dish to be a National Dish. You definitely need to try it while in Singapore and why not go to the best?  There are several locations and while this is not the original, I am almost certain that this is just as good. We didn't know that there was more than one location and we just put the name in Grab. The driver informed us that this place is really great. You can only imagine how confused we were to pull up to a mall vs Chinatown. However, it was 90 degrees outside and thought this was just fine. We wanted to beat the rush and arrived about 10:50am. There were about 10 people in line in front of us and the line moved really quickly.  The menu is pretty basic, you'll pick chicken or pork and then your choice of either rice or noodles. I went with their famous chicken and rice. The soya sauce chicken is really great with a nice balance of sweet and savory. Served with rice to soak up the wonderfully sauce. It's a simple dish yet packed with delicious flavors! The one thing that surprised me was that there are bones in this chicken. However, that probably is what made it even tastier. An order of this dish sets you back about $3.50USD which is absolutely crazy talk. I don't know how they keep it so inexpensive. This is a must visit...but if you want to keep it authentic, head for Chinatown (although I am sure they taste the same)."

We wanted to beat the rush and arrived about 10:50am. There were about 10 people in line in front of us and the line moved really quickly.  The menu is pretty basic, you'll pick chicken or pork and then your choice of either rice or noodles. I went with their famous chicken and rice. The soya sauce chicken is really great with a nice balance of sweet and savory. Served with rice to soak up the wonderfully sauce. It's a simple dish yet packed with delicious flavors! The one thing that surprised me was that there are bones in this chicken. However, that probably is what made it even tastier. An order of this dish sets you back about $3.50USD which is absolutely crazy talk. I don't know how they keep it so inexpensive. This is a must visit...but if you want to keep it authentic, head for Chinatown (although I am sure they taste the same)."
Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",4,22-Oct-18,Came here because of their one Michelin star award. I was expecting a small food stand but this place has been renovated and operated more like a restaurant with faint air conditioning. There were a lot of tables for seating. Their soy sauce chicken and rice used to be $2 and it is now $3.80 after gaining a prestigious award. I wish I got dark meat pieces because although the chicken skin had fantastic flavor (savory with a perfect amount of sweetness) the white meat was a bit dry. I had high expectations but unfortunately this place did not hit the spot for me.

Though, it was amusing to witness the tourists there instagramming and raving about the glorified dish. Sheep will be sheep, I suppose.

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",4,21-May-17,"Wow, this place is quite an upgrade from their simple hawker stall! Even has an automated kiosk where you can place your order by credit card/nets. The prices are slightly higher, averaging $4 for a plate since you're paying for the A/C and nicer seating area. Worth it though. No line at all if you go on a weekday around 3-4pm.  You get a number for your order and they ring a bell when your number is ready. Pretty tech savvy -- now if only the waitress didn't incessantly press the bell every single time...  I still think the charsiu (²æÉÕ) is the best meat of them all. It's lean while still has amazingly browned and caramelized edges. I'd buy a whole piece if they let me! Also if you're really into the meats, would be worth it to try the combo meat platters (charsiu/roast pork for $6 or charsiu/roast pork/chicken combo).  I also really liked the rice here and the homemade brown sauce that was poured on top of it. It had a very interesting plummy/sweet/savory flavor that was very complimentary to the meats."

The key to this place is to get here early, as I showed up 45 min before it even opened and there was already 15 people in line. The food is good and well worth the visit, I ordered the chicken and rice plate as that was their most notable dish.

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",3,4-Jan-17,"Saw this listed as a Michelin-starred Hong Kong Soya Sauce Chicken Rice in 2016. Was so happy to tried it out on my trip to Singapore in Dec. '16. I went to the original store around 1;30pm on a weekday. It was closed and was directed by a sign to their new location which started less than a month ago during the end of Nov. Many people like me were caught on a surprise, Anyway, it was a short stroll from the hawker center to the new location, basically across Smith Street of Chinatown Complex where the hawker center is. Wow.... the line was long, spend more than an hour to get in just to order. And as you can see why a 3 stars? Here's the summary....  Service - The staffs were very unpleasant, somehow they were all burned out(This new store was opened less than a month ago when I came) or they were way under paid. From the staff for maintaining the line to enter the restaurant(Just to enter the restaurant for standing in line to order). The staff that guild you ordering via a kiosk and he will not let you touch it. I tried to order myself as he was sllloooowwwwwww, his mind is like 20% working and the 80% thinking about something else, not work related I'm sure. It's just a koisk, I know how to press on the things I want, there's picture too but he gives me the look. Fine, after order and received a pager, attempt to locate a table while waiting for my food to be picked up. As I was waiting, I saw the staffs were slow at cleaning the table, they were upset at people who removed used plates and placed on unoccupied tables. People were cleaning tables themselves as they were waiting for the food. When the pager rang, time to pick up my food and asked the staff for condiments as it was almost empty. The ladies just replied 'Ok' and ignored me, I waited for more than 5 mins before someone came to fill. I believe the other popular Chicken Rice store in Maxwell Food Center did a better job organizing.  Food - The Soya Chicken was good but not to the extend for waiting for more than an hour or to die for. I do like the taste but it's a little too sweet for me. I don't mind the saltiness. The chicken mixed well with either rice or noodle. That's the only reason for a 3 stars  Price - Way to high. I am not comparing this with a hawker food center prices but a typical food court in a mall. For the portion provided with respect to price. It's consider very expensive. Generally, a plate of chicken rice/noddle comes with about a quarter of a chicken. Therefore a chicken can serve 4 plates of chicken rice/noodle but for them, for a chicken they serve 8 plates of chicken rice/noodle. You can imagine how little chicken you get. For 2-3 person, I will suggest half a chicken to share and not chicken rice/noodle plate. You will laugh at the portion for one person.  Conclusion - Way overrated. If you do visit Singapore, and you have not come here before, I will say do visit this restaurant but do plan according. Standing in line for more than an hour is really waste of time. Or to die for. Do not expect service. I believe hawker center do better than them."

Do not expect service. I believe hawker center do better than them."

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",5,21-Apr-17,"I'll admit that the only reason I checked this place out was out of curiosity, this place has had a certain amount of hype recently. First of all this is a new location in a nice and clean restaurant which takes away from the street hawker experience, but is probably more sanitary so I can't complain. I got what everyone recommended which was the soya chicken with noodles. You can order at the kiosk or order at the counter and they will give you a number. They have various drinks available and Tiger beer which was really up charged. The noodles were slightly cold but the chicken was warm so it wasn't an issue, however they are a bit stingy with the vegetables. The house made sambal sauce is yummy and so are the picked chilies, their condiment game is on point. My total was $4.80 which is slightly pricey for a ""hawker stall"" but you get extras such as air conditioning and food safety so it's worth it. I noticed there were a lot of foreigners here, more so than locals which concerned me but I think it was just my timing. I enjoyed my meal and while it wasn't the best thing I ate in Singapore it certainly is deserving of its Michelin star."

I realize the Michelin star was awarded to the original location in the actual hawker center, however the adding of locations must have have a negative effect. Honestly, it was easily the worst food we've had in 3 days in Singapore. The chicken was not very tasty, yet it was juicy. Perhaps because to us, it seemed undercooked. We had seen videos and saw some redness in the meat, but this was a little much. Rice was basic, sauce/gravy didn't really add anything. Sadly, the half egg was the best part.

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",3,16-Mar-17,"Food (1): For a Michelin star restaurant, I was severely disappointed in the food. To be fair, this could be my fault. I ordered the 3 BBQ Combo item. This included BBQ pork, Roasted Pork Belly and BBQ Ribs. Maybe I don't quite understand what Michelin means, especially for a ""hawker"". It's only after I sat down and looked at the screen and realize that they are known for their Soy Sauce Chicken. I thought Michelin stars for for the restaurant as a whole, not just one dish, but I could be wrong. Maybe the Soy Sauce Chicken is worth a try. However, I can say for an absolute fact that the 3 BBQ Combo I got was just pure trash. BBQ pork was not marbled in anyway and was completely dried and lacking in sauce. Roasted Pork Belly had barely any fat between the skin and meat. On top of that the Skin was dry and damp instead of having that oily, crisp crunch. Ribs were dry as well and also lacking sauce. As someone from the SGV area of SoCal, even he most average Chinese restaurant tops this place.  Service (5): The line to order wasn't too bad and moved quickly. For some odd reason people were lining up to order with the cashier. But there was a order machine right next to them. I skipped the lines and made a quick easy order using that. I really enjoyed that and am a sucker for innovation so I am giving it a 5 because of that.  Ambiance (3): You will notice I put hawker in quotes on the food section. This is because it's not really a hawker. It's a restaurant. Maybe at one point it was a hawker stall at the hawker centers, but not anymore. It's just a regular restaurant. Nothing special about it. It's pretty bland, but at least it's clean.  Price (4): Decent and cheap price. However, this is an American's point of view and food is generally cheaper for us because of the conversion rates."

Furthermore, the long lines/waits and jam-packed crowds with little room to maneuver and most importantly the STINK permeating the restaurant ensured that I will not be returning to this place.

She also took wrong orders from me and argued that I'm in the wrong. Later she gave me the detested look and walked away like I'm an unreasonable customer. Her colleague smiled and apologized for the wrong order. I am not returning to this branch."

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",5,6-Jan-17,"I actually wrote my review for the Hawker, but we stumbled on the newly opened restaurant by mistake. We were dropped off in the Chinatown complex and walked through downstairs and did not see any food. As we walk out, I see the large banner and sign and immediately told my wife and kids to line up. There were about 10 people ahead of us at 9:40ish so the wait was about 15 mins. During this time, I walk with my son to the hawker center upstairs where we were to scope out the stall. Got lost and couldn't find it and came back. By that time it was almost open and the queue was long. I know ppl will swear by the stall and it's much cheaper, but this place worked out well with the setup, seating, AC and the quick service. Amazing food, of course the chicken, but the three sleepers for me were the combo meat dish (roast and bbq pork), bay area spots can't hang IMO. The two other sleepers were the awesome hot sauce and the awesome peppers. Sweet and spicy excellence. The people in front of us were from Australia I believe and the two families behind us were from CA as well as ourselves. Obviously they are reaching tourists. Later we walked around the hawker and saw the original and I saw the line. Crazy long, but seemed to be efficient pumping out food."

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",4,27-Mar-17,"As of March 2017, the one michelin star is awarded only for the original stall (Liao Fan). I understand the Hawker Chan outlets will be vying for a michelin star award later this year. Until then ... for me the real winner is the soya sauce chicken and even the sauce too. All other dishes/sides are alright but nothing special about them. You can find equivalent quality for these other dishes/sides elsewhere. I have tried here twice and enjoy having the noodles with soya sauce chicken. The rice seems quite popular here and so is the Hor Fun except that Hor Fun noodles do not arrive early. My colleague ordered it at 12nn but was told the noodles were not in yet. Waiting in this restaurant is quite comfortable. First you queue up to place an order. As you get nearer the counter, you will eventually have a choice of ordering via a vending machine or continue in the line to the counter staff. People tend to take quite some time at the vending machine so I take that to mean it's not user friendly enough. This ordering queue takes about 15-20 mins, based on the before 12nn crowds. After placing your order and paying up, you will be given a receipt with a queue number. Now you can go to your seat and look out for the TV monitors that show the queue number for food collection. So far, diners there will just eat and go and not much lingering around so you should be able to get a table fairly quickly. I will go back again - just for the chicken."

Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,5,11-Apr-17,First time here but not new to the 'churrasco experience'  This place definitely rivals Brazilian steak houses in the US and other countries we've visited. What really took it to the next level was the superb customer service. Granted service is amazing all throughout Singapore but these guys really take the cake.  My husband and I were a bit apprehensive to try some of the meats like chicken hearts but the staff genuinely wanted us to sample a little bit of everything. We were unsure at first but we did try some and to our surprise it was actually pretty tasty.  All of the meats are cooked perfectly. I like my meat medium but they had several that were medium rare but so good!  Suggestions: - Go hungry - Do get items from the salad bar but not too much - Try a little bit of everything - you just might like it :).
Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,4,15-Mar-20,"We first visited Brasil Churrasco 25 years ago, and amazingly the friendly passador from Rio is still there! Homey atmosphere, with a good salad bar that includes heart of palm, feijoada (sans meat), and you can ask for yummy farofa too. But Brasil Churrasco doesn't serve basil churros or feijoada com macaca (black bean stew with monkey meat as in the Amazon). The cuts of meat are not as varied as at the best rodizios in Brasil, but you still find delicious picanha, cupim, filet mignon, chicken hearts, chicken, lamb, sausage, duck, etc. For me, the best time to visit is for brunch on Sunday. You can enjoy a nice siesta afterwards, whereas after a dinner here you might feel farty for a long time! Anyway, you would not want to eat meat for a while unless you are a sumo wrestler."
Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,5,21-Jun-19,"Value for money! If you are a meat eater, this is where you want to be. Service is attentive and prompt."
Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,5,26-Jun-16,"This is my first time here at this restaurant and it blown my mind away.  Firstly the boss would stand outside and invite you in, followed by seating. The salad bar is really extensive and there are so many food. Please do not take too many salad bar and wait for the meat to come.  The meat would be serve first round, all kinds of meat and following they would come slowly to let you eat slowly.  There are just so many meat that I could not describe all but please do try their duck confetti, chicken knuckle, beef chunk and most importantly the grilled pineapple!  For the price you are paying the meat are all exclusive and really hard to find in Singapore yet you are able to taste it here. Recommended!"
Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,5,22-Dec-13,"This churrascaria has been around for many years, and I've been coming here since I've been really young to celebrate birthdays.  The salad bar is pretty extensive, but it always takes me so much self discipline not to take too much in preparation for the meaty meal to come. This place serves up a buffet, except that the servers come to your table with the meat and cuts you a slice if you want.  I love love the beef, fish and the pineapple.  The Bahia Cooler here is the best. Must order! And definitely make a reservation!"
Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,4,12-Nov-15,"It has been a while the last time I dined here. And I'm talking about years and years ago when I was still in the University. So the very fact that the restaurant still packs the house to this day is testimony to something.  We were a party of 9 tonight and the meats just came by swift and furious. They are certainly not stingy with their cuts and the servers will often joke with us diners here and again, which really makes the dining experience great.  They have many different servings of meat and I enjoyed 90% of all served! I love how the grilling brought out the natural taste of the meats. Each of us had our personal favourite cuts so I'm confident to say you can definitely find something you will go gaga over. I, personally' enjoy ""Top Side"" slices very much.  And I forgot to mention that they have a salad bar that features about 20 items of delectable vegetables and pasta too!!! I loved their coleslaw and caramelised onions most! I could easily make a meal out of JUST the salad bar! But it's was a really tough choice to decide between more meat or more vegetables? So I just ate more BOTH!  I had to roll out of the restaurant after the wonderful meal! Will definitely go back!"
Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,5,12-Aug-12,"Prepare to starve yourself before making a reservation at this buffet style BBQ place. There is a salad bar with about 12 different cold dishes, but don't fill your plate too quickly! I made the embarrassing decision to get everything which only resulted in a sheepish request for a fresh plate to replace my overflowing one. Food wastage is never a good thing! Especially when every single meat was delicious.  Service is quick, efficient and all round excellent with super attentive staff. My lazy bum self was delighted that you didn't even need to move from your seat after the initial trip to the salad bar. Waiters would come round continuously with various meats kebab style, and slice it straight onto your plates. Must try dishes would be their rump beef, smoked duck, and BBQ-ed pineapple. Try asking for the burnt portions - its warm, sweet with the charcoal fragrance locked in it, really unexpectedly yummy!  $47++ per person for a Saturday night dinner, reservations are encouraged!"
Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,5,9-Jun-18,"This churrasco is legit. The meat was flavorful, and they kept it coming. The salad bar is on point as well, and the capirinha was well made.... Got here right after they opened. And by the time we left, it was packed! Service was good, quick. And attentive.... I would definitely go back!"

Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,3,23-Mar-14,"Authentic and overall good value for money for S$47++, but you gotta pace yourself. 4-stars relative to other places in Singapore, but in all honesty, not that great and 2-3 stars if compared to other places outside the country.  The cuts of meat in Brazil do not correspond directly to the ones you are familiar with. (i.e. the dotted lines on the cow are drawn differently). The picanha (aka top sirloin cap) is the most prized of Brazilian meat cuts, and that's the one cut that is done decently here, so you should grab more pieces when the passador brings it around to the table. Choose a piece that's slightly rarer.  The meat cuts are of slightly lower quality, they lack flavour and are sometimes way overcooked and dry. I couldn't tell if they were using a real wood fire or gas. Exotic stuff like chicken liver and chicken hearts are also served, which I appreciated. There were other items like lamb, grilled pineapple (abacaxi), sausages. They also had other non-brazilian offerings like roast duck (?!). The cheese bread (pao de queijo) was also average-tasting and were not spherical. They looked like they were baked in a cupcake pan.  Service however, is very good and attentive. Your plates are changed quickly, and some of the waiters are actually Brazilian.  I've eaten at other churrascarias around the United States and also some of the good places in Sao Paulo and Rio. In comparison, this place stacks up as 2 to 3-stars compared to other churrascarias outside the country. But there are very few players in this space in Singapore, so this will have to do."
Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,4,2-Mar-13,"This is a replacement review for one that mysteriously disappeared.  This is a review of a large (30+) team dinner that I hosted at Brazil Churrasco.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. Most importantly though, they kept the meat and drinks coming our way.  First, as with most Brazilian steakhouses, this place is about meat. Lots of meat and lots of different kinds of meat. T  here is a salad/food bar but make no mistake about it, you go to Brazil Churassco to load up on proteins, beef, pork, lamb, chicken, duck, etc.. The meat was cooked well. They use a lot of seasonings and there some great flavours along the way. This is no place for a vegetarian.  There was a steady flow of different meats and the team was up to the task. As with most of these, some of the better, more exotic, expensive meats come later in the process. So, if your appetite is a bit light, you might want to hold off on some of the earlier rounds.  I do think it is a great experience for a larger group. It is fun (and sometimes surprising) to see who can keep going and who drops out along the way.  Overall - This was a fun dining experience. I would certainly go again. But I would want it to be another group event. If you need a place for a party (and there will be no vegetarians), I suggest giving Brazil Churassco a shot. You will be well fed and I think you will have a great time  (ps - this is one of the few reviews i will post without photos.)"
Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,5,7-May-13,Didn't know where to have dinner therefore drop by somewhere near home. Walk in without reservation and I felt being welcome home. First visit that I have but had heard of this place so many times.  The decoration is normal but heart warming. It is not deliberate that's why it looks normal. Feels at home. My dad would buy some of the paintings  Meat comes to you. I recommend that you take smaller serving if you are here for the first time. All meat are well cooked and flavored. It seems that they perfected all kinds of meat preparation. It is really down to individual on which meat you would like.  My picky wife immediately pointed out smoked duck to be her favorite. I suggest you name your own favorite.  This is not a place for vegetarian. Vege you will waste your good money. The potato salad is world class though.  I never know that there is still such cheap restaurant around in Singapore. You pay $45 per pax you will get a $150 per pax service and serving. Haha. Love this place. Kudos to you!!!
Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,4,8-Sep-12,"Neighbourhood restaurant with top standards  There are so many good things about Brazil Churrasco: 1. It's in the 'hood, which means the service is warm, welcoming and you feel like you're family 2. The meats are top notch - you'll never feel shortchanged at the quality of the cuts 3. Lovely fresh salad bar items to help you get over meat guilt 4. Potent cocktails 5. The just-right rhythm of the buffet as the passadors come to your table bearing skewers of meat  Brazil Churrasco has been delighting customers since 1994; I remember heading there as a JC student in 1996 as a treat for the end of exams. Dining back there just a couple weeks ago, I have to commend them on keeping standards high. The restaurant decor is homey, not tired or slick, just a nice shade of comfortable, and the cuts range from beef hump to rump to ribeye, as well as chicken, fish, ham, lamb and more. At $46 all you can eat, the price is right for a monthly red meat treat that rivals some of the steak restaurants in town."
Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,4,8-Sep-12,"This is probably one of the oldest Churrascaria restuarants in Singapore and the food quality is still good. This is a place for meat lovers and carnivores. This place dish out meats, meats and more meats.  This is a typical churrascaria restaurant where the Passadores (the meat servers) would bring around skewkers of BBQ meats and walk around the restaurants dishing out the meats on the diner's plate. They served a rather expensive range of bbq items such as beef topside, beep rump, tenderloin, ham, chicken hearts, livers, lamb, smoked duck, pineapple, sausages, fish and much more. It also have a salad station for those looking for some fibre to accompany the meaty meal. Personally, I love the beef topside, rump, lamb and smoked duck.  Comparative to other churrascaria in Singapore, I prefer the variety and quality of meats here. Oh yes, and I love the mini cheese buns that serve prior to the start of dinner. Oh yes. Don't forget to order a glass of refreshing caipirinha to accompany the meal."
Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,4,26-May-13,"In a country full of restaurants operated by amateurs, this place is a welcome change. The staff here were friendly, well trained, and attentive. The meats were good (great variety served to your table) and the sides (self served buffet style at a bar) were all tasty. Comfortable, casual, and warm atmosphere. We had a party of 6 and all left happy and content. Since it is all you care to eat, you will most likely leave very full. Pace yourselves! Will go back soon."
Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,4,3-Sep-13,Good overall Churrascaria. I was thrilled to find it after a long day of biking.  The Picahna was very good. The other beef cuts were average. The mutton was a little too gamey.  Overall selection ( I think they said 14 cuts) was average.  Service was very good and pleasant.
Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,4,4-Dec-14,"Be warned! This place is strictly for serious meat lovers-:) They serve a wide variety of meat, marinated and grilled (South American style) to perfection. Ambiance is nice, quite and romantic and service is friendly. Pleasent dining experience enought to fill you apettite for meat for a month."
Brazil Churrasco,4.4,19,Brazilian,4,29-Mar-14,"Lots of meat! Good food, great selection. Kids liked it very much. Only downside is the noise. Feels a bit like a train station."
Hawkerman,4,1,Asian Fusion,4,17-Aug-19,"Tried this outlet on a Saturday evening. There was a one elderly couple ahead of us. The restaurant appears to be short on service staff. But they were rather prompt.  Food are pretty good. Reasonable portions but prices accordingly to the mall air conditioning setting. The person that took our order is knowledgeable to the local taste and will prompt what variations of hot beverages I wanted.  You have to wait for your seat even though there's empty tables. But you have to order and pay in advance at the cashier. Menus are on each table or will be brought to you. They accept various credit cards, NETS and cash. You will be given a beeper and will ring when your order is ready to be collected at the ""Take Makan"" sign, which literally mean take your food.  We tried the usual local dishes: Nasi Lemak with Tom Yum flavor chick leg (latter is nothing usual), seafood Lor Mee, Roasted chicken wings (you can order in twos, fours or sixes), mushroom soup and the garlic bread and a cup of Yuan Yang. (Coffee and tea mixed)  Nasi Lemak is rather ordinary. The Lor Mee was tasty. The rest are pretty ordinary as well. The Yuan Yang was made by the cashier who asked if I preferred more or less sweet - that's nice.  Other than walking up to the cashier to place and pay for your order and collecting the food. That pretty much it.. enjoy your food and leave when you are ready. The service staff will clear your table and get ready for the next customers.  The restaurant is not that crowded on a weekend evening because there are lots of restaurants in this newly opened Funan Mall. Lots to try there..."

If no where else in America could get it right, how could a small place inside of a mall in Singapore do it? I'm not sure but this happens to be one of my only repeat experiences in the city because the bagels are just that good.  Is it true to form NYC? Not entirely. They're a bit on the small side but boy, do they have a bite to them.

Could Two Men be employing a similar method?  They claim to be the first bagel house in all of Singapore and started only a handful of years ago. Each bagels are supposedly handmade and they recommend that folks who don't want to face the daily disappointment of their potential selling out should call ahead of time to confirm availability.  The bagels themselves are soft and have just the right amount of density. The variety is not impressive to most New Yorkers / Montreal folks, but they do have some interesting ones like cheddar, salt, garlic, and all-sorts (everything bagel). The salmon they're using is not the kind of lox I'd find back home, but this is a respectable alternative for being on the other side of the world.  For first timers, keep an open mind. This is one of the only games in town and the closest thing to anything from the US. Try one of their bagel sandwiches (I vote for the lamb or bo-ssam) and beware of the morning lines."

Don't come here if you're looking for a bona fide, proper New York bagel because the owner, Borne, tells me that his bagels are made with the Singaporean taste buds in mind. He's tried bagels from both coasts of the U.S. (probably in between too) and has decided to make the bagels lighter and smaller. He make batches throughout the day to ensure freshness and quality. Business had a rough start a couple of years ago but things are really rolling now. Swing by and get treated like a VIP customer, which is becoming a rarity these days, and treat yourself to a round of deliciousness. You won't regret it."

So many regrets just to tell you that this place is DA BOMB!  I heard many raves so I was super hesitant, mainly due to previous experiences with hyped Western places in Singapore but Two Men delivers! I took one bite of their Cowking bagel which is pastrami based and I was sold. It was everything I expected and more!  In addition, the staff is amazing: they are super friendly, knowledgeable and cheery.  Once I am done crying in my corner over the fact that it is quite far for me, I am going back!!

I visited TMBH after reading fellow Yelpers' reviews and was not disappointed.  One bagel plain with no cream cheese (schmear on their menu) costs $2.60, or you can order 3 bagels for $6. I went with a friend and got 3 bagels toasted, with no schmear, mostly due to the price tag. The schmear costs +$3-5 extra, which is quite significant compared to the cost of the bagel.  All three bagels I ordered (black and white sesame, multigrain, and cinnamon raisin) were excellent, tasting fresh and perfect. Will definitely come back again when I have my carb cravings!"

Obviously its busy for a reason. Also, the music was so loud. Felt like I was in a club with base pounding and could not hear ourselves talking. Reason why I fave 4 stars instead of 5.

It was one of the establishments that kept appearing under most recommended whenever I was around the area, so i really had to try it.  The place itself reminded me of a small cafe, seatings were limited and the menu was mostly written in chalk on the boards above.  Pricing aside (hint, its abit expensive for bagels, but then again, everything around this area is priced on the higher end), the bagels were really fresh and delicious! I ordered myself a 'chix' bagel which was basically mayo chicken with an assortment of herbs and spices inside. What took me back was not the filling, but the bagel itself! They went out of 'rye' bagels and i decided to go for the caramelized onion flavour (i think thats what its called), not knowing what to expect. The explosion of moist flavor from the bagels was really something i was not expecting, since what i ordered was actually quite dry.  That being said, I've decided to make it my personal mission to at least try half of the bagels on menu, the flavour combinations all sounds very interesting and delicious!

It was one of the establishments that kept appearing under most recommended whenever I was around the area, so i really had to try it.  The place itself reminded me of a small cafe, seatings were limited and the menu was mostly written in chalk on the boards above.  Pricing aside (hint, its abit expensive for bagels, but then again, everything around this area is priced on the higher end), the bagels were really fresh and delicious! I ordered myself a 'chix' bagel which was basically mayo chicken with an assortment of herbs and spices inside. What took me back was not the filling, but the bagel itself! They went out of 'rye' bagels and i decided to go for the caramelized onion flavour (i think thats what its called), not knowing what to expect. The explosion of moist flavor from the bagels was really something i was not expecting, since what i ordered was actually quite dry.  That being said, I've decided to make it my personal mission to at least try half of the bagels on menu, the flavour combinations all sounds very interesting and delicious!  If you're looking for a quick quality breakfast, lunch or snack and dont mind paying abit extra for yummy FRESHLY made bagels, do give this place a try!!!!"

You can choose between different bagel dough and complete bagels or create your own. Very nice staff who will help you out if it's your first time there.

Every time I'm even remotely near Tanjong Pagar (so maybe all of Singapore) I think to myself, ohemgee I could get a bagel.  'The Lox' comes with pickled beets that are freakishly pink and delicious. Other innovative sandwiches are also great.  Tbh these bagel sandwiches get a little messy and filling, but it's Singapore and if you're looking for bagels, it's really only here or Sacha and Son's in my book. (But plz let me know if you find anything else!!!!!)  Yours truly, A New York Bagel Freak"

Two Men Bagel House,4.5,84,"Bagels, Breakfast & Brunch, Sandwiches",3,29-Jun-16,"My timing was pretty bad - lunchtime, very crowded. Nevertheless I made it to the counter and ordered a Rodeo.  I love roast beef and it sounded great. I ordered a rye bagel and set down at one of the large tables that are meant for sharing.  The bagel arrived shortly thereafter. What surprised me was the brown colour of the roast beef but I tasted it anyway. It did taste different from what I am used to, and was a bit too thick and fatty for my personal taste, but the greens and the relish and the sauce.. very nice. The bagel itself was close to fluffy, but still some density for a good bite and taste without having to worry about an immediate shutdown of any bowel movements which is often the case with heavy bagel dough.  Later on I was curious whether roast beef in S'pore is different from what I am used to and went on their Facebook page: there was a photo that showed the Rodeo with pinkish roast beef. So, I don't know what piece of meat I had today but it surely (unfortunately I forgot to take a photo..) wasn't the standard.  I did love the friendly, smiley staff. Having had my share of snobbish, ignorant staff at other places this week, this was really nice.  So, I'll be back!"

Let me explain.  I organized a potluck brunch on Sunday and my American friend brought a giant brown bag to lunch. I was all ""hrmph who brings store bought food to a potluck?"" as I cooked my organic sausages from Ryan's when he said, ""I brought bagels"". That made me almost drop my sausages right there.  Bagels?!! In Singapore? ""  ""Please tell me it's not those expensive things masquerading as bagels from 'New York' that are sold in Cold Storage?""  ""Nope it's from Two Man. It's right by my house, I chat with them all the time and they make awesome, as-good-as-it-gets-in-Singapore bagels...oh and try the walnut cinnamon raisin something magic spread in that tub and thank me later.""  At that point I was pretty stoked to find the bag contained TWENTY bagels in a gazillion flavors. I couldn't find a sesame bagel (cos I'm boring like that) but I found a brown raisin one, popped it in the toaster and generously spread the magic stuff on.  Oh. Ma. Gawsh.  Oh. My.  I ate that bagel in about a minute. And then I ate a half more.  It was crisp on the outside and had a good chew. Granted it isn't New York or Bodo's great, but hey we're in Singapore. Plus I'm told the prices are faaaairly reasonable, unlike the child I traded in at Sacha & Sons for a lox bagel. So yes, the next time I intend to blow my carb budget, I'm taking this bum down to icon village. Wherever that is."

I even signed up for bagel baking classes just so that i can make my own (i still haven't though) because nothing in Singapore satisfies my craving. Well Sacha & Sons does a decent one but there is only 1 option (sesame, with garlic herb schmear). I've been meaning to try Two Men Bagel for the longest time, upon word that freshly baked hand-rolled doughs are done here.  To determine the quality of the bagel, i had to order them on their own. Bagels are priced from $2.60 onwards. I went with the Cinnamon Raisin Bagel with Walnut and Raisin Cream Cheese ($4.50) because sweet is always logical with a latte.  Well well. Knock knock. The crust was more like a shell, with a slightly blistered crust all around. It was too hard (mind you i'm comparing them to the NYC ones). Plus the dough was a little thin, thus it lacked that nice doughy chew. Flavor wise, it was also kind of strange, with an alkaline aftertaste, possibly due to the almost pretzel like shell. Perhaps i should have stuck with the regular cream cheese because the walnut raisin one was kind of grainy instead of rich creamy and the amount was so little! URGH. #spoiltbynyc Next time, i may just go with the Plain Cream Cheese and Berries Jelly but honestly they need to have more cheese on these.  Well Jr really liked the Chix ($9.90) on his onion bagel. The tender house-roasted diced chicken thigh were generously smothered in lemon garlic aioli and peppered with the sourish pickled relish and fresh greens. We both agreed that the filling was delicious but it overshadowed the bagel. It could have been any other bread. In fact, it would have been better if it were a different carb that didn't jab our gums with the hard shell. I had a few bites of the onion bagel on its own and it was rather flavorless, alkaline, and hard. BAH.  I really wanted to love Two Men Bagel, but i can't. Can i like it? Maybe. But it kinda ranks the same as the packaged NYC Bagel Factory bagels, which may not be as fresh but at least their crust is better. Go for their bagel-wiches to avoid disappointment. At least it'll fill you up and the filling will distract you from the bagels. Or get the sesame bagels from Sacha & Sons and slather it with your own cream cheese mix."

Prices are reasonable ($8.50 for the piglet) if not a touch pricey given the size of the servings. Taste makes up for that though. I also went out on a limb and splurged on the $4.50 lemonade. It was worth it. I even got a free refill; probably wouldn't happen if I hadn't been one of only 3 or 4 customers on a lazy Sunday, but kudos for the responsive service given the circumstances.

T.A.B. on multigrain bagel ($10.90) - 2 stars Too little cheese and too much tomato, while the multigrain bagel was oddly tasteless... It just didn't even taste like bread - it didn't have the right yeast-y flavor I suppose.  We ordered 3 cinnamon raisin bagels and 20 minutes later they told us they'd ran out... Broke my heart. A tub of cream cheese to go is rather pricey - $8 for plain, $12 for the flavored ones.

Two Men Bagel House,4.5,84,"Bagels, Breakfast & Brunch, Sandwiches",4,19-May-15,"If you want good food, and a cute view (according to my colleague), this is the place you want to be for breakfast, lunch and maybe even dinner?  My first counter with Two Men Bagel House was during a Yelp event that my friend brought me to (also the event where I downloaded the app and joined the community) where there were coffee and bagels! I had quite a good impression of the menu that they brought over during the event and definitely fell in love with the Jalape?o cream cheese - it is to. die. for. (IMHO*)  The bagels that were brought to the event were way beyond the normal plain bagel, and my friend and I were lucky enough to be the last to share a sundried tomato bagel - I highly recommend this because the bagel itself is so flavorful! It was a more DIY / pick-your-own-fillings at the event, which I liked because friend and I decided that we should share the bagel AND have two different flavours in one bagel as we didn't want to take one each - too much bagel for breakfast!

Two Men Bagel House,4.8,22,"Breakfast & Brunch, Bagels",4,19-May-15,"If you want good food, and a cute view (according to my colleague), this is the place you want to be for breakfast, lunch and maybe even dinner?  My first counter with Two Men Bagel House was during a Yelp event that my friend brought me to (also the event where I downloaded the app and joined the community) where there were coffee and bagels! I had quite a good impression of the menu that they brought over during the event and definitely fell in love with the Jalape?o cream cheese - it is to. die. for. (IMHO*)  The bagels that were brought to the event were way beyond the normal plain bagel, and my friend and I were lucky enough to be the last to share a sundried tomato bagel - I highly recommend this because the bagel itself is so flavorful! It was a more DIY / pick-your-own-fillings at the event, which I liked because friend and I decided that we should share the bagel AND have two different flavours in one bagel as we didn't want to take one each - too much bagel for breakfast!

I was looking at new apartments (long story) in the area and needed to pop over to Cold Storage to get Ranch Dressing and other annoying American crap, and spotted this little unassuming bagel place blasting rock music. I was going to keep going when a guy was like HEY! Hello! How are ya? I was intrigued, and everyone knows you shouldn't go into the grocery store hangry, so.... off to bagel land I went. I asked him what the most popular bagel situation was and he told me two, one was the Rodeo. I was a little skeptical being from Texas, anything in Singapore called the Rodeo could not like up to that name, right? But it sounded mildly interesting so I went with it. The service first of all is super friendly, but they only take cash, or net. No CC. My bagel goodness gcame out in a jiffy, and it was REALLY good. I chose the sea salt bagel (they should sell them to go) and it came with some kind of mustard relish and roast beef I think. Whatever the mixture, it was good. I could barely finish it, because it is a meal, but VERY tasty. My only worry is that if I move in the neighborhood this will up my carb intake, but it'll be worth it!"

If you've never had a bagel, this is probably a rather overpriced experience, but if you cherish the memory of a deliciously crisp and chewy bagel with cream cheese, lox or pastrami, then this is one of the only good places that serves up a taste of New York.  I think the pastrami here isn't quite as good as the only other place I've found with good bagels here (Sacha & Sons), but it's still pretty decent. The bagels themselves are, of course, amazing.  I like their non-pretentious attitude here - they allow you to bring whatever drinks you want to accompany your bagel (in fact, they helpfully suggest that the Cold Storage opposite has chilled wine for sale). I've never seen that level of hospitality elsewhere. Kudos to them!"

Now we're from NYC so we know how a bagel should taste. For some reason this bagel was flat it was missing some of that cushion. Now I'm sure it's really hard to get bagels here in Singapore. But 101 before in baking dough is, dough needs to rise. This gives it that consistency of that doughy taste. Unfortunately there was no rise. They have great combinations of putting a sandwich together but their main focus should be making that bagel taste great. Try it out and you can see what I mean."

The plus point is that the price remains the same at $4 per bowl. I went after the office lunch hour and was enjoying my noodles in peace, save for 1 little table with overly loud UOB bankers. The place is relatively clean too!  Will come back again soon!  p.s. Heard that the original stall is still at BK eating house with different people wearing the same uniforms and cooking the same mee sua/mee pok. Which is better? I think this is, this is the original!"
Teochew Restaurant Huat Kee,4.7,3,Chinese,5,12-May-24,The ambience was ok and classy. The food arrived soon as we ordered. The cost was ok. Service was gd.
Teochew Restaurant Huat Kee,4.7,3,Chinese,4,15-Feb-16,"Today the company was having its annual chinese new year reunion lunch. The meal was a set menu which costs $720++ for 10 people. The restaurant was located at the second level of the hotel and looked quite new and bright.  Prosperity Yu Sheng ÐÂ´º·¢²ÆÓãÉú We started the meal with the traditional raw fish salad which was served with salmon. It tasted quite tangy and refreshing.  Cold Platter Lobster Salad with Prawn Roll É³ÂÉÁúÏºÆ´ÏºÔæ The prawn roll was served with sweet flour sauce, and tasted quite crunchy although I would prefer it to be more juicy.  Fish Maw & Scallops with Chicken Soup »¨½º¸É±´¼¦ÌÀ The soup was light but full bodied. Full of essence from the chicken.  Teochew Style Steamed Pomfret ³±´¶²ýÓã The fish which was steamed in teochew style with preserved plum and mushroom, was quite meaty and fresh.  Braised Abalone Chunks with Bai Ling Mushroom ±«½ÇÉ°×Áé¹½ Surprisingly the mushroom tasted way much better than the abalone. The mushroom was quite flavourful while the abalone was a bit too mushy in texture.  Stewed Pork Rib with Vegetables Êß²ËìÀÅÅ¹Ç It was a well braised with the green leafy vegetables soaking up the flavours. The meat was very tender and soft.  Stir-fried Fish Noodles ³´ÓãÃæ It was my first time having fish in the shape of noodles. Light with a kind bouncing texture.  Prosperity Yam Paste ´ó¼ªÓóÄà The dessert was topped with lots of gingko nuts and orange on top. I felt that it was a bit off having orange as it lent a taste of bitterness to the dish. I would prefer it to be served with sweet and melt in the mouth pumpkin.  Overall the food was delicious and the old aunty staff serving us was quite friendly too. Never though that there was such as good restaurant over here."
Teochew Restaurant Huat Kee,4.7,3,Chinese,5,31-Aug-12,"Back in the 80s, you could always count on several teochew restaurants serving up the best teochew cuisines in Singapore. Sadly, these days the standards even among the famous few like Ban Seng, Hung Kang, Mong Hing and Tai Seng, are not what they used to be.  Fortunately, tucked in corner of Amoy St is the aptly named Teochew Huat Kee. The owner Mr Lee insists on serving only the most old school Teochew cuisine here. From starters to desserts, every dish is authentic and traditional, and hard to find elsewhere. More important, they are all done very well.  Just some of my favourites are the to die for jellied pork trotters and pig liver roll. The latter is like prawn rolls but only filled with pig liver instead. Of course only the freshest and largest steamed pomfret is available here. And the best, sugared yam or yam paste to finish.  Yes, Huat Kee is a little pricey. But it's the perfect place for special occasions with elders who will definitely appreciate it."
Ya Hua Bak Kut Teh,5,1,Chinese,5,8-Nov-16,"They have a pretty simple menu. Everything is reasonably priced. I had the Bak Kut Teh and Watercress Soup. Both were very tasty. Service is good.

Hortus,4.3,4,Mediterranean,4,14-Jan-24,"Pit stop mid way through the flower dome for refreshments.  You might mistake the path to the restaurant as a path to another flower exhibit. I had this spot marked for their high tea. But unfortunately was there in the morning. So..... a refreshing chilled glass of moscato was in order. It wasn't quite lunchtime, so the only food available were light snacks and pastries. Drinks, you could order wine, limited cocktails or specialty coffees. I was good with just kicking back and enjoying the surrounding gardens, relaxing and sipping the wine, since I had already hiked 4 miles.  This quaint bistro is located inside the Flower Dome. Not sure if you can access it without a ticket to the dome."
Hortus,4.3,4,Mediterranean,5,31-Jul-23,"Make a lunch reservation here when you visit the flower dome!  My sister in law just got married here, and it was absolutely gorgeous. It's a smaller space, room for maybe no more than 50 or 60 guests seated, but they managed to add in a nice isle and flower arch where they had the ceremony.  If you've been to the flower dome, you'd know it's kept at a perfect 68degrees. It felt absolutely perfect, minimal humidity, while giving the illusion you're outdoors and surrounded by edible herbs.  The food here was excellent. While we were here for a wedding, I imagine any meal eaten here would be delicious. It's Mediterranean, and done wonderfully.  We enjoyed a full mezze selection, delicious frito misto, clams, watermelon salad, whole fish, suckling pig... the list goes on and on. There is nothing I wouldn't recommend!  I'll definitely bring friends visiting Singapore back to this restaurant to enjoy a peaceful retreat after exploring the flower dome. An amazing experience!"
Hortus,4.3,4,Mediterranean,5,2-Aug-23,"Book afternoon tea here and get free access to flower dome included! It's quite popular so reserve ahead online.  Best part of the experience is the ambiance. It is located inside the flower dome, so entrance is included (which is worth $12), allowing you to visit the dome 30min ahead of reservation or after the reservation for as long as you want!  Service has been functional and transactional. The team associated the dining venue is top notch but the cafe team is more casual and more basic. But the food quality is pretty decent and beverages are free flow (one at a time though). They have a vegetarian version of the set menu. Overall one of the best afternoon tea values in SG.  Note, there is a free tram cart ride to the restaurant from the taxi drop off - just give them your name.  Enjoy!"
Hortus,4.3,4,Mediterranean,3,22-Sep-23,The food was great but I thought having a $50 minimum spend per person to sit down for lunch was unfair especially since we already had tickets to flower dome. Service was ok in general
Craftsmen Specialty Coffee,5,7,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch, Juice Bars & Smoothies",5,11-Mar-24,"Found this spot when searching for an oat milk latte near Chinatown. Small spot with plenty of tables. Quick service, takes credit card. Ordered an iced oat milk latte and it was great. I had already eaten breakfast but they appeared to have an extensive menu, so I would definitely go back and try the food.  Clean, lots of open tables on a Friday morning. Quick, friendly service."

Craftsmen Specialty Coffee,5,7,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch, Juice Bars & Smoothies",5,16-Jun-18,"Dear lord this place is amazing.  I came in with an appetite only really looking for some espresso and a pastry. Come to find out they have a full fledged menu of breakfast and lunch items so I decided to get a burger and fries followed by my latte and a pastry.  First off, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. I used the wrong credit card and rather than just saying sorry, the staff took the time to reverse my charge and make sure everything was right. Second, I ordered a burger and was planning to get my latte later but they allowed me to order all at the same time so I could jump to the head of the line when I went to order my latte. The burger and fries were phenomenal then the latte and chocolate & almond croissant I got afterwards were spectacular.  I can't recommend this place highly enough. I will definitely be going by there again, at least once more before I leave and any time I come back."
Craftsmen Specialty Coffee,5,7,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch, Juice Bars & Smoothies",5,16-Mar-19,"Stumbled upon this restaurant at 10pm on a Friday night and luckily they had a table open. We ordered the white wine shrimp angel hair pasta, Hawaiian pizza, and salted egg yolk fries. The pasta was al dente and had the perfect amount of seasoning and flavour. The salted egg yolk fries were highly addictive and served piping hot. The portion sizes are very generous and well worth the money. To top it all off, we got a promo for 20% off all food items. As I write this review the morning after, I am contemplating returning to get a box of take-out fries to eat at Sentosa Island."
Craftsmen Specialty Coffee,5,7,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch, Juice Bars & Smoothies",5,16-Nov-19,"Wonderful espresso! Had a double shot this morning. Very tasty. I waited perhaps 5 minutes after ordering, so turnaround was good. I enjoyed it inside at a table. There are many windows so it's got a lot of nice ambient light. Would definitely recommend any of their branches for good espresso."
Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",4,21-Nov-20,My 3rd visit was when I tried using the self service kiosk. Easy to use and fuss free with photos showing what the order looks like. Good for single or two orders. Complicated orders should use the human cashier. Food as usual is good value for money and I always have the soya sauce chicken. Sometimes with the noodles and sometimes with the hor fun. Love that the noodles are done in the HK style with the right amount of chewiness.

Without a doubt, I had to make my way here while visiting Singapore to try out their soya chicken and rice.  Delicious, yall.  The sweetness of the soy sauce was a perfect marinade to the traditional roasted chicken and rice. We also ordered the noodles with charsiu (pork) - bomb, as well. A total of three dishes and three water bottles was about $13. Wtf... I should've taken advantage of the opportunity to dine here every day! Lol.  I highly recommend those visiting to check out this hawker!"

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",4,20-Aug-17,"I like that this is nearer home plus it is air conditioned.  The wait is still at least 20 minutes on a Sunday after 2pm.  If you are dining in, you need to get a table first before placing your order.  There is a machine which accepts cash for takeaway orders.  So you place your order and the queue number is written at the top. Go to the pick up area and wait for your number to be flashed on the board. If there is more than 10 or 15 digit gap, go outside and walk around.  The chicken is nice but I think the one at the original hawker stall in Chinatown food center is better. The white meat is not as tender here. Same for the char siew and sio bak. I like the noodle and the sauce though.  For just under $5 a plate, this is better quality food and value than those served at generic food courts or coffee shops.  I will still come here as it is near home and parking is easy. Once the underpass from Tai Seng MRT to the building is open, this will be even more accessible."

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",3,19-Apr-17,"After hearing that this place earned a Michelin star. My husband and I decided to pay this a visit.  Located in 18 tai seng, this place really gets crowded during the lunch hour. Avoid at all cost. Wait times could be 30mins, at least we waited that long for our order to be ready.  So, we got our order, everything looks glistening. First note, it was oily. A lot of oil swirling around my noodle and our bean sprouts.  My soy sauce chicken hor fun was good, but I didn't think it was better than others of the same. The chicken was smooth and tender, so are some that I've tasted elsewhere. The bean sprouts were crunchy but it was not any different from other stalls who also serve this.  We also ordered a side of char siew & siew yok, I felt the siew yok was so tender that it had not texture. Could've been better if there was some bite.  Overall, I don't think it was any better than other soy sauce chicken dish. I hold my praises for this."

Liao Fan Hawker Chan,3.8,164,"Noodles, Chicken Shop",4,15-Nov-17,"Came at around 2.45pm on a weekday. The working crowd has dissipated and its all alone for me and my chicken. First of all, I followed the guy before and ordered extra noodles for the soya sauce chicken. Boy was I shocked at the huge quantity of noodles and wondered if I were able to finish it. After the first bite.. the chewiness, the sauce, the chilli paste, the green chillies I added... oh so many emotions. I may be exaggerating slightly, but it ain't totally.  The noodles were chewy, and not disappointing. It soaks up and pairs with the soya sauce pretty well. The sauce is a little sweet and very flavourful. Noodles paired well also with the refreshingly cold green chillies. Next surprise: the chillies they gave. It's not spicy as I thought it would; in fact it was very mild, but there is a ever-so-slight prawn paste taste to it. I love it!  Soya sauce chicken was tasty and the chicken is not like fantabulous so keep your expectations around there. Although its one michelin star, its hawker food for the masses after all. Chicken's soft enough for me and I quite enjoyed it. I just wish there were lesser bones. Some people said that the one in Smith Street is better; I hope to try that out someday. For now, this brings soya sauce chicken to a consistently good level. Seriously impressed!"

Keep in mind you still have to order first and then find a table. Best tip is to divide and conquer especially if you have a big group. One person wait in line while others find and reserve a seat because that is how it works.  Order the chicken and pork and you won't regret it. Use the tray they give you NO matter what you think you can handle. The sauce can spill easily so don't risk it. They do accept credit card and enjoy your meal.

Five Oars Coffee Roasters,4.7,10,"Coffee Roasteries, Breakfast & Brunch",4,23-Dec-18,"Went for lunch with about 8 friends on - Tuesday. Expectedly not crowded but it has big space and it filled up quickly during peak lunch time. The ambience is simple and open. The overall food and presentation was good for the price. The service was prompt and nice. Overall 4/5. No real complaints. We averaged about 25$ per person which included main items , coffee and desert."
Jiang-Nan Chun,4.3,9,Chinese,5,10-Dec-23,"Came by for dinner the other night and it was a phenomenal world class experience. Jiang-Nan Chun is located on the 2nd floor inside Four Seasons Singapore and has a bus stop that stops right across the street from the Four Seasons.  Made a reservation 60 days in advance and my table was ready upon arrival. Front of the house staff were all dressed in uniform with a name tag and they were beyond hospitable throughout the evening. They were able to customize the set menu to cater to my desires!  Jiang-Nan Chun serves traditional Cantonese haute cuisine and gives off old money vibes. The restaurant is featured in the Michelin guide.  Meal started off with a mini abalone topped over a small piece of daikon, a cute way to start the meal.  Moved on to the soup course and the flavors were very bold and the quality of ingredients were top notch.  The appetizer trio featured roast duck, roasted pork belly, along with a honey bbq pork collar. The roast duck was warm and crispy, although a touch overcooked. The crispy pork belly was phenomenal. The honey bbq pork collar was quite fatty and flavors were excellent.  The braised spiny lobster was cooked to perfection. The sauce was flavorful and light while the lobster was light and refreshing.  The wok-fried Australian wagyu tenderloin with mushrooms was also a hit. The tenderloin had decent marbling and the mushrooms were very big and fragrant.  The seafood fried rice was also excellent. Wok hey was on point and there was plenty of seafood inside.  The palate cleanser was a light and refreshing way to move on to the dessert course. The pomelo mango sago was decent. The pomelo didn't seem too fragrant or flavorful. The mango sago definitely made up for it though.  Meal ended off with a couple of petit fours.  ~$235/head after GST & 10% service charge for dinner. I got the sense that they validate parking."
Jiang-Nan Chun,4.3,9,Chinese,4,11-Oct-23,"decadent meal at jiang nan chun, four seasons hotel the other day. peking roast duck was sublime - crispy skin, melts in your mouth meat wrapped in thin crepe. delish. besides that, we also ordered the famous char siew and roasted pork, scallop cheong fun, stir fried hk baby kailan and char siew bao. food was of best quality you can get in a chinese fine dining restaurant. impeccable service too. . not a place you can walk in everyday for dim sum lunch (for me at least), but defnitely a place i would recommend if you want to host a luncheon / dinner, or a special celebration with your loved ones or friends alike.  ambiance's semi casual. remember no shorts and slippers allowed"
Jiang-Nan Chun,4.3,9,Chinese,4,30-Dec-19,"We had a wonderful brunch here yesterday at this Michelin-star Cantonese restaurant. We started with an amuse bouche of radish in vinegar, followed by assorted dim sum (order by the piece here) and hot tea. My mom and I shared Lung Ching Dragonwell, and Eric R. had oolong. The dim sum included fried bean curd skin around shrimp paste, black pepper beef puff, steamed shrimp dumpling with gold leaf, mushroom and bamboo dumpling, and Eric R.'s BBQ pork bun. The shrimp dumpling was so juicy and delicious - we all enjoyed it very much, but each little bite was tasty.  This is the first restaurant in Singapore that gave us ice in our water, which is awesome. Our next course was a half roasted duck deboned and put in plain and spring onion flavored pancakes with sweet Cantonese sauce. We enjoyed this very much. The duck was also juicy and flavorful.  Then we shared the black pepper prawn and noodle claypot with a side of jasmine rice. It was hot and flavorful as well. We were given a shot glass of calamansi juice to cleanse our palate. I decided to get dessert, and enjoyed almond tofu with lychee granita in a martini glass, which was a fun and tasty way to end the meal.  Service was very attentive and we got a lot of tea and water refills without asking. The food was beautifully displayed and delicious. The ambiance is very beautiful too. Reservations are required."
Jiang-Nan Chun,4.3,9,Chinese,4,14-Jan-19,"4.5 stars. Upscale 1 Michelin star Chinese restaurant in the Four Seasons Hotel - Excellent food. The Peking Duck was as good as the hype though the caviar addition seems excessive / didn't feel like it added too much value to the dish. - The salt and pepper duck meat (how we asked the remaining Peking duck meat to be cooked) was good but not as good as the Peking duck - The BBQ pork collar was very good - melt in your mouth yummy with the right texture and taste - Fish was good quality though nothing particularly impressive considering the price i.e. I expect something of this quality. Stir-fried veggie was surprisingly impressive - for a simple dish, it was cooked very well / very fragrant - Dessert: the red bean pancake was good though not spectacular. - Expensive / special occasion place. Good detail-oriented professional service."
Jiang-Nan Chun,4.3,9,Chinese,4,9-Feb-21,"The ambience is typical Four Seasons - intimate, understated chic. The same goes for the food and service. Except for some dim sum dishes, the offerings are not terribly innovative, just classics made with superior ingredients and very well executed. Even a mundane dessert dish like glutinous rice balls in almond cream is a great pleasure to eat! Service is impeccable - unobtrusive but efficient and pro-active. So, what are the drawbacks? The menu could be longer, and prices are such that few people can afford to come often: About $9++ per PIECE of dim sum; the Buddha Jump Over the Wall is delish, but $128++ for a bowl of soup is a bit extravagant!"
Jiang-Nan Chun,4.3,9,Chinese,4,16-Jul-18,Excellent menu and great service. So good I went twice. (A special mention to Dolly) So when in Singapore do yourself a favour. #facxual_events
Jiang-Nan Chun,4.3,9,Chinese,5,2-Jan-15,"After Dreams of the Red Chambers and Legend of the West, Four Seasons Jiang Nan Chun introduces their Literature series once again and the theme is none other than ""Four Great Beauties of China"". Not only will you be mesmerized by the exceeded beauty of the dishes, one will be dazzled by the narration that reveals the other side of these legendary personalities. Why does Yang Gui Fei love soaking in fragrant baths and how can the fishes be so amazed by beauty of Xishi that they forgot to swim and drowned to their blissful death? The 5-course menu is really worth trying and I highly recommend you to do so before it ends on 31st Jan :)"
Jiang-Nan Chun,4.3,9,Chinese,4,8-Jan-13,"Not all have read the Chinese Classic ""Dream of the Red Chamber"" but now it is not just a book but has been transformed into a seven course meal curated out of the 168 recipes from the book.  The entire was not only a feast for the eyes but also for the mind as the very knowledgeable staff takes time to explain the romance behind each dish. The taste, of course, is beyond words.  The ala carte on the other hand, was rather average except for the spinach tofu. Will be back for dim sum!"
Jiang-Nan Chun,4.3,9,Chinese,5,21-Feb-16,"Sunday brunch at Jiang Nan Chun is phenomenal. From the succulent roasted meats, to the exquisite soups and the well-executed mains, just about every dish on the fairly extensive ala carte buffet menu was flawless. Not one bad dish. So even if we had to waddle out of the restaurant, Jiang Nan Chun is definitely on my to-return list!  Apart from Cherry Garden, this is the only other place I'd ever advise anyone to visit for such ala carte buffet brunches.  Service was as of you'd expect of a Four Seasons, attentive but unintrusive, efficient and slick but warm and gracious."
Jiang-Nan Chun,4.3,9,Chinese,4,17-Dec-14,"Jiang Nan Chun serves Cantonese cuisine in luxurious settings. Their Peking duck is excellent, particularly their pancake wraps which is super thin, thus allowing you to savour the crispy duck skin. Dim Sums is also worth trying, generous with meat and fillings. My favourite is the custard burns with salted egg yolk. Overall, was a sumptuous dining experience."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,27-Feb-24,"Fat Cow, a premier Japanese steakhouse in Singapore, stands out for its exceptional quality Wagyu beef, offering a culinary experience that transcends mere dining. With a focus on excellence, the restaurant boasts an inviting ambiance complemented by outstanding service, where every guest is treated with unparalleled attention and care. The Wagyu beef, known for its rich marbling and sublime flavor, is a testament to Fat Cow's mastery in selection and preparation, positioning the establishment among the elite in Singapore's culinary scene. Despite the premium price, the experience--marked by exquisite cuisine, a warm atmosphere, and meticulous service--justifies the investment, making Fat Cow a must-visit for those who appreciate the finer aspects of Japanese cuisine and hospitality. So, to sum it all up, Fat Cow is not merely a dining venue; it's a destination that promises and delivers an unmatched exploration of Wagyu beef, ensuring a memorable experience for every visitor."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,11-Oct-22,"After eating in many steakhouses, it's not quite easy to impress as my standards have grown quite high but Fat Cow renewed my excitement for this fare. While they won't wow you for ambiance, the quality and precision of both their meat and seafood dishes is superb.  If price is a considerable factor, dine for lunch as the sets are way more reasonable than the a la carte options for dinner. While of course the marbling on an A4 or A5 Wagyu makes the beef melt in your mouth, I personally find it to be too fatty for my liking. The Fat Cow donburi was the perfect balance - not too thick, but still extremely tender and packed with flavor. The seasoned rice with the hint of truffle was a great pairing.  Other dishes to recommend: scallop and uni tempura, truffle rice  Will come here everytime in SG"
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,29-Aug-22,I hardly give 5 stars coz I always want to give restaurants room for improvement. Fat cow does Donburi bowls and they do it fantastically! I just ordered the lunch set menu with the fat cow donburi. Didn't break the bank if this is a once a few month indulgence. I added a few other Ala carte items that is probably going to put me over s$100 a little. Everything was well worth it. I would very much like to come back and order the curry short ribs next time ... and if you could smell the pictures .. it would smell damn delicious !
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",3,1-May-23,All in all a good meal. Service was good. Would suggest let the prep work be a show case performance instead of hidden away. Snag for us came at the 7 of 9 dishes where the grill A5 beef has tendons that my baby teeth can't chew up! Though it was grilled there is no crispiness or melt in your mouth goodness. Now that ain't good for the expected standard of wagyu. Also when u have truffle on many dishes that be a sign of the chef running out of ideas. On the fence if there be a return trip.
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,21-Dec-22,"This peculiar restaurant is truly a steak lover's paradise. In addition to chargrilled beef, this Japanese steakhouse offers shabu-shabu, sukiyaki, sandwiches, and rice bowls. This amazing selection of top meat is sure to please Wagyu beef connoisseurs. Even better, you can see your meal being prepared from your counter seat!"
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,22-Aug-19,"Great beef!  Had the FatCow Premium Donburi Kagoshima A4 Tenderloin. It came with foie gras, sea urchin and caviar. Superb!  It's so so good that I'm still thinking about it 3 days later."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",3,31-Jul-21,"Had this during heightened alert. For takeaway, hard to tell the difference between the Australian wagyu ($98) and the aged Nagasaki version ($145). Even with 1-for-1 Entertainer offer, it's overvalued. If you can't wait until they reopen, go for the cheaper Aussie version. The minuscule tomato salad is good, but is a joke!"
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",3,14-Oct-18,"You should only come here if you love, and are ready to pay through the nose for Japanese wagyu beef, especially Kobe. Because the non-beef items (tofu skin apetizer at $35++, or sushi/sashimi, etc) are several levels below what you can get at top sushi restaurants (eg. Shinjiis, Hashida, Ashino, Ki-sho, Kimura, Waku-ghin, etc). More importantly, the level of service is poor fir such a premium outlet. We did not experience rude or lying service as described by certain reviewers. The staff (all non-Japanese) are quite polite, but here you have to ask for everything (eg. refills), whereas the Japanese staff at the aforementioned restaurants not only anticipate your needs, they even replace your tea or iced water with fresh cups/glasses. There is little merit in sitting at the counter, because the chefs here don't smile or talk to clients at all! Even the excellent beef is not given proper treatment: it is cold after a few minutes, because it's not served on a (non-cooking) hot plate; it should be served with sea salt on the side to help enhance the taste of the beef. The premium donburi is very good, although the caviar is not first-quality, it may even be just fish roe! The huge electric meat cutting machine in the middle of the main dining room is truly characteristic of the whole place: functional but lacks class! It's also quite conceited and nouveau-riche of them to insist on a dress code, when you can wear shorts to Shinjii or Hashida!!"
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,8-Jun-22,Great food and great ambiance ... a bit pricey but i am definitely planing on going back again.
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",4,20-Mar-16,"The fois nigiri is simply my favorite bite of food at Uchi, and perhaps in the world, so when I saw fois donburi on the menu at the Fat Cow I knew where I was going to eat. I was only in Singapore for 2 days, and they are closed on Sunday, so Monday lunch was my only opportunity. Thankfully they had the fois donburi as a lunch set item.  My hotel is right around the corner, so for me this was a convenient location, but it's about 10-15 mins away from the CBD. Singapore isn't very big and I was actually coming from the CBD doing touristy things, so I can assure you it's worth the $7 cab ride (even less in USD). This restaurant is oddly located in a medical center, so don't worry about the heart arrack options, you're in good hands with Singapore's healthcare system."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,27-Mar-19,amazing meal. A wagyu lovers paradise. Really enjoyed all the dishes we ordered and the rice that came with the donburi was out of this world good. I still salivate just thinking about how flavorful it was. My favorite dish was the A4 donburi bowl but the wagyu steak sandwich came pretty close too. you cant really mess up a good meal when you use the best ingredients and cook it in its ideal form. I only wish I lived closure so I can try more items on the menu next time.
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",4,2-Oct-17,"Overall : 4.5/5 Barring the price tag, still remains a must-try. Advice is to book up to 2 weeks in advance especially for lunch, and more importantly, download the Entertainer app! It gives you a 1-for-1 deal!  For lunch : Wagyu donburi is pretty much the ONLY item you should order. Huge bowl of well-filled ingredients (read : decent portion of uni) with perfectly cooked wagyu sitting on top. FYI, the sauce that comes with it is extremely yummy, feel free to ask for more!  For dinner : my partner and I tried the full cut of Ohmi and Iwate. Please please do it if you have spare cash lying around - not kidding when I say everything melts in your mouth instantly. Everything good comes with $$$$ so it was a worthwhile experience - but probably only for a special occasion.  Hope this helps!"
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,7-Jan-16,"Fat cow is definitely a place to try. The place may be a bit difficult locate (ok at least it was for me because I was not acquainted with Camden Medical center before that), but it was worth the long walk (we walked from Ion - took about 15min).  The place was pretty packed when we went at 1300hrs for lunch, and because we didn't make reservations, we were asked to come back at 1400hrs (SO, DO CALL IN BEFORE DROPPING BY!).  We both had the set lunch (ranges from about $35-$50), which is quite reasonable for such a pricy place. It comes with soup, chowaimushi, salad, and the entr¨¦e.  Let's just say that I experience heaven when I first ate the wagyu don. The meat was nice and tender, and I love the sauce on the rice so much I ate everything - that's a big deal because I'm not a great fan of rice!  I was also pleased to see that they had an extensive selection of Umeshu. On the rocks is the best way to go! :)"
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",4,24-May-16,Extremely nice restaurant. The steak was devine!!!!! The prices are steep but worth it if you are a true meat lover. Nice decor & ambiance. Agree its a bit difficult to locate if you are not familiar with the area.
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",3,19-Jun-18,Great set lunch deal. Walked out belly full. Wagyu steak was good. Though a couple of slices were a tad sinewy. But the rice below was so good.
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",4,9-Apr-15,"Before I walked into Fat Cow, I was expecting a very small portion with huge prices. This was far from the truth. They actually had many cheaper options on the menu and they are JUST as good as the more expensive options.  ""Then what sets them apart?"", you say?  Well... you get EXACTLY what you pay for - you can order a whole steak... with a side of that delicious japanese rice with egg or you can spend 35 -40ish with cubed wagyu with rice and an egg in a claypot. BOTH were good!  Down here.. you can still decide if you wanna splash out the cash or still have a very decent meal at a decent price.  I've heard tht this was a place for beef so of course I went for the 40 day aged wagyu with a side of rice, onsen egg and ordered m'self some foie gras! It was my birthday weekend anyways! :)  My friends ordered the claypot beef rice thingie and another had the wagyu steak and a side of beef tartar. Both very yummy indeed!  Being a major beef lover, I'm the kind that either hardly eats any beef if it isn't good but if I DO have a beef craving, i'm going to make sure its a good cut and mostly costs over $40 anyways.  You can be sure I'll be putting this little gem in my pocket of ""places-to-go-for-good-beef""!  BTW... I heard the lunch specials here are very affordable and worth it! Those who have that extra free time or don't have to work like the rest of us, well don't say I didn't mention it! You can thank me later! :)  4.8 STARS"
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,1-Nov-14,"There are great restaurants and there are MEMORABLE restaurants. Fat Cow is one of those memorable restaurants that you will talk about for a very a long time. I brought my wife here for our 2nd year wedding anniversary based on the glowing reviews on yelp.  The Food was good, that's an understatement. The Ambience was sexy and dark, that's an understatement. The rice, yes I segregate rice from food because in my world rice reigns supreme, was sublime, that's an understatement.  When you come to Fat Cow, there are two dishes you MUST order: the Wagyu steak (pick any grade, they are all out of this world) and the Fat Rice. The Wagyu at Fat Cow unlike any steak I've ever tried. It has the tenderness of a tenderloin yet the juicy taste of Ribeye. However, the pride and joy of Fat Cow is the PHAT Rice. ;-) Perfectly cooked high grade Japanese rice layered with the oil drippings of the very Wagyu just prepared for you a few minutes prior. Holy smokes!!!  To tell you the truth, I started my dinner with the Fat Cow Donburi - Wagyu Beef with Onsen egg and shiro negi. However, as soon as I saw my wife's Wagyu place across from with the fat rice arriving soon thereafter, I immediately had buyers remorse. I ate my Donburi as I fast can, which was good, but no where near the quality of the Wagyu dish sitting across from me. As soon as I was done, I ordered exactly what my wife ordered and I had no regrets!  This dinner was truly special in more ways than one. However, for me to judge Fat Cow purely on its merits, I would consider it among the very best dining experiences I have ever had.  Did I mention we also had Australian Pinot Noir to accompany our fabulous dinner. :-)"
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",3,19-Jun-15,"Foie and wagyu is pretty expensive and its hard to get in NorCal. California banned foie gras for a couple of years and then allow foie lovers to consume this rich protein early 2015.  Thanks being said, when I see a restaurant serving two of my top 5 favorite proteins, I'm on a mission to clog my arteries.  Ordered the fat foie and wagyu donburi bowl and the truffle sea bream sashimi.  The truffle sea bream sashimi was good but not fantastic. They put too much truffle oil and ponzu that overpowers the fish.  As for the donburi bowl. I'm happy that they gave a 1:1 foie/wagyu portion but was sad that the wagyu lack the natural beef flavor bc it was season with some garlic soy. The beef was cooked nicely and it passed as a filet.  Overall, service was on point but food was mediocre."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,28-Sep-14,"Fat Cow, oh Fat Cow, can you please be less delish so that I would not turn into a fat cow myself?  The lunch deal is an amazing deal for the budget-conscious. Perfectly Charcoal-grilled wagyu with a perfect onsen egg - mix it all in over Japanese rice and your meal is complete.  The set also comes with chawanmushi (not the best I've had, but you are not here for this), a salad, miso soup, and ends with a daily dessert. The day that I was there, it was an amazing honeycomb ice-cream that still has pieces of honeycomb in it. Perfect for the recent hot weather. All these for under s$40.  This is only a review for lunch and I can't wait to go for dinner, or another lunch, or another whatever at Fat Cow.  Reservation is a must!"
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,19-Aug-14,"Wow. Was I impressed. Not only does this restaurant offer A5 wgayu from Japan and beef bowls, they also serve delicious sashimi and sushi.  We ordered the set lunch which is a great deal and a lot cheaper than the regular menu.The menu also offers different cuts of cow (hence the name) as well as Australian and Japanese wgayu, American beef, shabu shabu.. etc...  The set lunch comes with appetizers- salad, miso soup, and egg custard pudding. All yummy. The egg had shrimp and mushroom in it, and it tastes just like the ones in Japan.  Sushi Moriawase, 46 Chef's choice of 10 premium sushi I did not expect this to be amazing.. but boy was I wrong. There was toro, salmon, scallops, hamachi, red snapper (last three not sure) and salmon roe. The toro melted in your mouth.. and all the fishes were super tender and fresh. The salmon also melted in your mouth which was unexpected because its salmon... ugh I loved this plate.  The Fat Cow Donburi, 38 Charcoal grilled wgayu beef with onset egg & shiro negi- wow. for some reason they failed to mention there was truffle on it. like why would you omit that from the menu? Nice surprise, and damn was the meat cooked perfectly and extremely tender and flavorful.  Fat Foa-Gura Don, 45 Glazed foie gras and grilled wgayu beef over rice. omg. everything about this bowl was perfect. added a poached egg on the side, but it wasn't necessary. The sauce on the meats were already enough and so so good.. and the rice with the sauce was great as well. This bowl was .... perfect. I was already full from the sushi but I couldn't stop eating because it was that good.. Also had red radishes (I think) on the side to go along with it.  You would think a restaurant not focusing on any type of food and having all these different types of Japanese food would decrease its quality and taste, but not this one. Everything was top notch and extremely yummy. When I'm back in Singapore, you will most definitely find me here."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",4,23-Apr-15,"I'm not on here to talk about how awesome all the cows served in the restaurant (because hands down, everyone knows it's spectacular) but on the side dishes and a drink instead.  At first, I ordered the Phat Rice aka Fat Rice, that costs $8 because of all the reviews I read, but oh man, I was hugely disappointed. It's just like regular gohan with a few drops of soy sauce that the restaurant claims to be some legit oil (in fact, it's just like a plain gohan to be honest).  I was hugely amazed by the glistening and gorgeous-looking Zosui rice though! I knew it, from the moment I saw it on the menu book that it would be such an incredibly astonishing meal. For those of you who wonder what the heck is Zosui, well, according to an encyclopedia, Z¨­sui is a Japanese rice soup made from pre-cooked rice and water. BUT! Instead of water, the Zosui in Fat cow is made of AUTHENTIC BEEF AND MUSHROOM BROTH! Can you imagine??! No? Okay, go try it yourself then. :D  For the drinks, my partner and I ordered a light alcohol drink with peach and lychee flavor, on the rock. The alcohol content was just nice for an early dinner, tastes slightly sweeter than Umeshu but I love it. The only disappointing thing was the amount served, just way too little. :(  Service and interior wise, it was wonderful!"
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",4,13-Oct-12,"This is another amazingly beautiful room. The 3D wooden matrix celling is nothing short of beautiful.  Link to external source for interior photo:  http://tinyurl.com/8fujph3  Along with the beautiful room, the conservative Japanese influenced service was excellent. The servers were consistently insuring the meal was moving forward. They were each very professional and polite.  My friend does not drink sake. She selected a cocktail called the Unusual. Unfortunately, I can't remember what she thought of this cocktail.  With a little input from the server, I decided on a sake for myself. After selecting my glass from the tray offered, I tried the sake (DASSAI JUNMAI DAIGINJO) and was quite pleased. I tend to lean more towards sake with a profile featuring slight touches of fruit.  The food ranged from good to very good. Honestly, I was expecting very good to excellent. Some dishes flirted with this but I do not think they quite reached it.  Sushi Mori - Featuring very high quality fish and strong preparation, this was a very enjoyable dish.  http://tinyurl.com/9oq7ey4  Truffle Fries - These were also very good. I could certainly taste the truffle. Plus, the fries had a very nice crispiness.  http://tinyurl.com/8zyaa8u  Zuchini Blossom Tempura - This was one of the highlights of the meal. The tempura blossoms were stuffed with Hokkaido scallops. It was a delicate and subtle dish. The presentation was very impressive.  http://tinyurl.com/8mjcsyr  Wagyu Ox Tendon & Foie Gras - I did not try this dish. I have made a personal choice not to eat foie gras. My friend said it was good but not great. She grew a little tired of the tendon.  http://tinyurl.com/9rqmwxy  Snake River Farms US Wagyu Steak - This was good. it was cooked perfectly. However, I thought the cut was a little on the small side. Plus, it was a bit bland. It is possible that it was not properly rested before slicing.  http://tinyurl.com/9zzsq7b  Shabu Shabu with Grade 3 Japanese Beef from the Kagoshima Prefecture - This was good. The overall presentation was very nice. I do think though that due to its nature, the depth of flavors of the meat in shabu shabu is limited. Hence, the special sides for increasing the flavor. My favorite part of the shabu shabu was actually the mushrooms. They were divine.  http://tinyurl.com/99zxd4x  Overall, this is a beautiful restaurant with truly excellent service. I just thought the food fell ever so slightly short. From a presentation standpoint, I thought it held up to any restaurant I've visited in the last year. However, from a flavor standpoint, I thought it fell a tad short of some others. When visiting restaurants of this caliber and expense, the expectations are very high."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",4,22-Apr-19,"Good food, cosy atmosphere, but pricey. Location a little off from hustle & bustle but not too far off. I'd come by for special occasions dining. Everything from the menu are basically good, except for the prawn in the moriawase which was a little fishy. Other than that, two thumbs up for the food taste, especially with the beef selections."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,10-Aug-12,"Gourmet lunch on a budget  Dining at Fat Cow can quickly burn a huge hole in your pocket, so if you're not looking to spend upwards of $250 on a meal, there're also the +/- $60 lunch sets.  Us group of ladies decided on a Friday treat and managed to snag an inside table for 6. Most of us ordered the donburi despite the carbo threat - honestly, don't waste a single grain of the perfectly plump, chewy, sticky short-grain rice; it's that good.  While 1 friend took the Hokkaido don (with seasonal seafood), 3 others ordered the Wagyu donburi with onsen egg while 2 of us went for the foie gras & wagyu donburi. The wagyu was everything you hope it would be - fat glistening cubes of meat that almost melted in the mouth with no resistance. I didn't expect the cubes of wagyu to be of such high quality - at least A3 if not higher. The crisp pan-seared cubes of foie gras also had a nice smoky char that added to the fragrance of the bowl. I love my fatty (eg flavourful) meats, so this portion was perfect. Some thought it was a little too much but finished up anyway. The lunch set also includes miso soup, salad, a chawanmushi and dessert, all of an amazing quality that gives you a taste of the full fledged experience.  Lunch sets available from Mon-Fri only, 12-3pm."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,20-Dec-15,"Great place for Japanese-style steaks, shabu-shabu and sukiyaki. The appetizers and desserts are also awesome. If you have the Entertainer application you can get main courses one-for-one which is a great deal."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",1,19-Mar-18,The standard of the food here dropped tremendously from the last time I've been here. I usually enjoy my steak w. a tinge of salt and that will be perfect. But the steak here is not as good as I remembered. The taste was blend and dissatisfying; I had to drown it in the ginger sauce to give it a taste.
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,27-Oct-18,A little pricey on the food. I went there for omakase. The food was just excellent. From the appetizers to the main course. everything was just perfect
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",4,24-Jan-18,"Very good in food, service, environment. Not difficult to make reservation. The only thing makes me rate it only 4 stars is not professional in details. The A5 beef is served in low temperature, which impacts the overall taste. Not very impressive, but good enough!"
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,19-Dec-15,"Its hard to find a better experience than this. Food and service were awesome. If you're looking for a japanese inspired steak house, THIS IS IT! Bar none. You gotta try it."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",3,29-Dec-17,"Last time this is my favorit place to have lunch, donburi rice is nice. The beef so tender n juicy, foigrass so nice ,but I feel nowadays the quality of taste abit different."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",4,27-Oct-14,"Full review: http://jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2014/10/fat-cow-camden-medical-centre-singapore.html  Decided to check out Fat Cow to celebrate the homz's birthday and as well as using the entertainer app for 1 for 1 mains. Fat Cow offers high quality cuts of well marbled beef from Australia, Japan and USA.I made a reservation at 2pm for lunch, last order is 230pm. I went for lunch instead cuz I wanted to try the highly raved 'The Fat Cow Donburi' ($39) from the lunch menu set. It's charcoal-grilled wagyu beef with onsen egg and shiro negi. Note that each set includes salad, chawanmushi, miso soup and dessert. I finally know why everyone says this is a must eat from the lunch menu. The shiro negi enhance the whole bowl which makes every bite so delicious. We had Grade A3 Sirloin (100g) in Sukiyaki style ($78) and Blackmore Ranch 220g ($85) as well. Both were heavenly, more in review.  Two weeks before while making my reservations online, I causally put a special note which says, 'celebrating a friend's birthday'. After that, I totally forgotten about it. But to my surprise, we were served with a happy birthday platter with a scoop of ice cream after our meals. Ah best service ever. :)"
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,12-Jul-12,"Holy Fat Cow, what a mindblowing experience!  That is all.  Oh alright if you insist.  Food : The zucchini blossom tempura stuffed with Hokkaido was delicious! Light and crisp yet extremely more-ish. Love. We also had the wagyu ox tendon pan seared foie gras and daikon ... the flavor was really brought out by the fact that it was slow cooked although I'm personally not a fan of ox tendon, and was nicely balanced by the daikon. We opted for shabu-shabu and charcoal grill, and was recommended the Japanese Grade A5 and the US Wagyu respectively. Both turned out absolutely mindblowingly out of this world delicious. We could have eaten the whole cow!  Ambience : The people behind Fat Cow have taken over the premises that housed the former Le Figue and turned it into something chic and gorgeous.  Service : Excellent although the attentiveness of the chefs became a bit unnerving after a while.  Not for the fainthearted."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,5-Dec-16,Went on a Saturday while I was in town and enjoyed an amazing set menu meal. I had the Wagyu Beef with a soft egg/ Wagyu Nigiri/ Shishito Peppers/ and a few other appetizers. Absolutely great service and atmosphere. The food was delicious and priced reasonably considering the quality. I went for lunch on a Saturday and I recommend getting a reservation. I'll be back next time I'm in Singapore.
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",4,15-Jan-14,"There have been mixed reviews on the restaurant and one thing I heard was that the food doesn't justify the price. However, with the downward revision of the already affordable lunch sets, I don't think anyone would be deterred from checking FC out. Each set comes with salad, chawanmushi, miso soup and dessert with your choice of mains. Pick from the 12 mains which are priced from $25 to $48. Don't worry if you're not a beef fan, there are sashimi, pork and chicken on the menu too.  The chawanmushi was topped with a light tasting crab sauce and it has prawn, mushroom and scallop in it.  We ordered the Kinoko ($14), assorted Japanese mushrooms braised with sake, lime and butter. Honestly, it tasted like normal stir fry with a tinge of lime. A disappointment really. And it was a rather small portion.  We also tried the Nasu Dengaku ($10), barbecued eggplant glazed with honey miso. This is a tiny baby Japanese eggplant and it certainly isn't worth the price tag. There was a plum undertone in the salty miso which didn't sit well with the girls.  We had the 2 hot favorites at Fat Cow, which is the Fat Foa-Gura Don ($42) and The Fat Cow Donburi ($38). It was a tussle between the 2 choices but here's the flavor profiles so that you can decide for yourself! The Fat Foa-Gura Don has the rich and buttery glazed foie gras chunks and grilled wagyu beef cubes. The sauce was a little on the sweet side but the overall flavor is strong and heavy. I liked the toppings on this one but i found the rice to be a little on the dry side and it acted like a sponge, soaking up all the oil from the goose liver..  The Fat Cow Donburi is a simpler dish in comparison but it has its own merits. Charcoal grilled Wagyu Beef with a light garlic flavor, with onsen egg and shiro negi. The first thing we noticed about the dish was its truffle aroma.  Break the egg and mix everything together and enjoy the moist and flavorful rice. Absolutely delicious."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",2,28-Sep-13,If you are a vegetarian you have not a lot of options here. 4 veggie side dishes that are insanely expensive. I mean 3 slices of sweet potato for 12S$? Really? The vegetable tempura was not that good. I had better in cheaper places like Shin Kushiya. But the service was very good and very nice. Overall much to expensive for what you get.
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",2,16-Mar-19,"Food is great and chefs are good an interacting with patrons. However, staff are rude - barely acknowledge your existence if you are a well in customer."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",4,23-May-14,"this was a great lunch! the decor is beautiful with a 3d wooden cube structure on the ceiling that elicited notes of traditional japan while still being contemporary. on to the grub: i ordered the wagyu beef cubes with foie gras donburi. the beef was slightly overcooked versus my order of medium rare, but the foie gras was cooked perfectly. the rice was a bit plain, some gravy would have been groovy. i tried my friend's wagyu with egg donburi and that was much better. the hamachi carpaccio with truffles was heavenly, although the taste was a bit heavy. the mushrooms were no bueno - flavors were too strong and too salty. we barely ate any of it. I also had one of the grilled prawns. it was quite nice, fresh and cooked perfectly.  service: service was poor. my grilled prawn came after my dessert ice cream. really? also, i asked for a water refill and waited 15 minutes for them to top off my cup. there aren't even that many customers here, how can they be so slow?"
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,9-May-15,"Fat cow is for meat lovers. They have sea food and Sushi like any Japanese restaurant, But you don't go there for that. Besides there are other places, arguably better. No you come for the beef. Forget the fancy Japanese meat dishes and just go for the slab of steak. They have Japanese, Australian and US. Skip the rest and head for the Japanese to really sample authentic wagu cooked to perfection. Order medium rare at most. Anything more cooked is sacrilege. Side dishes are meager but very good. The stuffed zucchini flowers are excellent, as are the various salads. Order the smaller portion of meat. Your wallet and stomach will thank you. The high fat content will fill you if you take the time to savor each piece. This is not the time to wolfing down your meal. Chew more times than you normally do before swallowing to get the full experience. A side dish of fat rice is the perfect accompaniment. Be prepared to pay through your nose though, but for that special occasion, go for it."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",1,23-Oct-12,"Way overpriced for what you get, service is terrible and the place will be closed in less than a year.  The menu is designed to deceive you. The waiter explains that the beef is priced per 100grams, but you have to pay for a minimum of 200 grams, and the chef weighs the piece that they have, so you have no idea what it is going to cost. We got a cut each of the Australian Wagyu and the US Wagyu for $360. Between four people that is a ridiculously small amount of beef for the price.  Starters were the dumplings and the sashimi special for $120 and it is itty bitty portions. Now the food was delicious, but there is no way you can justify that price for some raw fish that would fit on the average side plate.  The beef was decent, but it does not take that much experience to cook it medium. We popped a bottle of wine for $170 and that rounded out the whole overcharged experience.  A couple of tips for the management:  1. Charge less or serve more. Your menu is misleading, and I hate being ripped off.  2. If your restaurant is empty, why were some menu items unavailable?  3. Train your servers better. Every time I took a sip from my glass, the waiter refilled it. In addition, they hovered around our table watching us before ordering, and watching us eat. Majorly annoying when you are trying to enjoy yourself with friends.  4. Change the name and the location, they are both stupid.  5. Better yet, just close up. You are not offering an awesome enough experience for $160 per head"
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",3,3-Dec-14,"After all the rave reviews on Yelp, I was really excited to try this place out for the awesome lunch. I like to visit atas restaurants for lunch first, and if the taste agrees, I will proceed to having dinner. I was super excited about this foie gras and wagyu beef rice bowl, and boy, did it disappoint. The first time it was served, it wasn't what I expected. I had asked for rare, and dark chunks of over-cooked beef and foie gras (meagre serving) was just not what I had hoped for. I sent it back and the second time, it was still slightly overcooked but I did not want to send it back the second time. The thing that really gets me was the lack of marinate/ flavor in the beef cubes. It tasted like it was just salty, with no umami whatsoever. Service was good, servers were very professional. For a meal that was $48++, I will not be coming back. The food just did not deliver."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,31-Jul-14,"Their beef and foie gras bowl is worth every penny... Although every time I finish, I'm tempted to order another bowl."
Fat Cow,4.1,41,"Japanese, Steakhouses",5,13-Jun-14,"I love steaks. I am always on the look out for a nice slab of marbled meat. So far, Fat Cow's steak is the best I've ever tried. Being a big fan of steaks, I ordered the A5* wagyu steak, seared to medium rare.  *A5 is the highest grade being awarded to wagyu beef. It is determined based on its marbling score, meat colour and brightness, firmness and texture of meat, and color/quality of fats.  The steak was 300g and cost $298++. That comes up to more than $1/g and every mouthful that I took was probably worth $10 but it was so worth it! The divine taste of beef, fats that melted away without giving a greasy feeling, coupled with the grainy yet tender texture of the meat created the perfect steak ever. Every bite that I took, I went straight into heaven, lingered there for awhile, before coming back down for another bite. It was really that good. Of course, this was also the most expensive steak I've ever eaten so I was glad it measured up to expectations.  The steak was served with a shoyu dip with grated ginger and sesame. Initially, I was skeptical about dipping such a marblellous piece of steak into shoyu but wow, the shoyu brought out the sweetness of the beef!!! We also asked for some freshly grated wasabi to pair with the beef because we liked that combination.  We also ordered a few other dishes to share before the steak arrived.  Traditional 'onsen-egg' served warm with a hunk of crispy fried beef bone marrow in a citrus dashi  The bone marrow was crispy and light with a tinge of sweetness while the citrus dashi added a refreshing taste. Break apart the yolk and you have a creamy balance of sweet and saltiness. A perfect appetiser!   The zucchini stuffed with snow crab was amazing! The tempura was light and crispy yet not oily and there was a large amount of crab meat inside. The crab meat was fresh and sweet. We also had the choice of dipping it into mustard which excited our tastebuds. Overall, this was a unique dish and we loved it.  Barbecued eggplant glazed with honey miso  I am not a fan of eggplants but this was pretty good. After scraping off some of the miso (as it was too salty for my liking), the eggplant was actually palatable! It was so soft it almost melted in the mouth and I loved the slight chargrilled taste. The honey miso made it a really appetising dish indeed.  Grilled gamba carabineros  I was really excited to see gamba carabineros on the menu. Gamba carabineros are a type of Spanish red prawn and ever since I ate them in Barcelona, I could not stop thinking about them. Like the ones I had in Barcelona, these were simply grilled with sea salt. The prawn was sweet and fresh but not as fresh as the ones in Barcelona as the meat was not as firm. Still one of the better prawns in Singapore though! For gamba carabineros, you MUST eat the brain juice! According to the chef in Barcelona, that is the best part of the prawn and the reason why gamba carabineros are so highly prized. Do not worry though, for the juice is really sweet.   Handmade mochi with peanut and green tea powder  The mochi was extremely soft and chewy, sweet but not cloying. I preferred dipping it into the green tea powder for a slight bitterness.  Milk pudding with red beans  This dessert was disappointing. While the pudding was smooth, it lacked taste and the red beans were too dry to help. This left an unpleasant taste and texture in our mouth.  Summary  Cost: ~$580 for 2 people, with 4 alcoholic drinks Food: Excellent steak! You have to order the A5!!! Service: Polite but slightly slow Ambience: Romantic, counter seating recommended Dress code: Smart casual Will I recommend it? Definitely!"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,10-Jun-24,"We wanted a non-US tourist meal. The food here is Indian or Malaysian and over 75% of the female customers wore Muslim head coverings. All of the employees were ethnic Indian.  DH started with chicken murtaba and then had a curry dish. The curry was too spicy for him and it was also too much food for him. I had the chicken masala and a side of cabbage.  We weren't in love with the food, but seeing all of the locals happily devouring the food, I'll rate four stars."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,15-Nov-23,"Came to Zam Zam to try murtabak and it was pretty good! I went with the mutton version and was surprised that I really couldn't taste the gamey flavor, maybe because it's ground and then scrambled with egg? The crepe it was wrapped it had a roti-like texture that was crispy, delicate, and chewy. It was also delivered with some curry on the side which really packed some heat but was also really really good!  With my murtabak I ordered an iced teh c (ice tea with condensed milk) and it was very refreshing as all iced drinks are in Singapore lol.  SGD 9 for this hearty breakfast"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,28-Jun-24,"famous murtabak but also very oily and if not made fresh then gets clumpy and dry, nice dipping sauce flavor and spice"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,2-Oct-23,"Zam Zam is a longstanding Indian restaurant in Little India with plenty of tables on the first and second floor. It's a sit down restaurant with an extensive menu with Indian classics as well as some dishes that demonstrate the Singaporean influence on Indian cuisine. Their drink options even have the classic tehs and kopis. Regrettably, I was already quite full before I arrived so my sister and I only ordered one dish to share, but the servers were super nice in explaining the dishes we didn't recognize.  Tulang Merah (4.5/5): This is a dish that the internet says was invented by the Indian community in Singapore and is a bright red mutton bone marrow curry. Honestly, I had no idea what to expect, but it was perfectly balanced between sweet, savory, and spicy. The mix of spices was super unusual and while I'd never had anything like it before, I'm sad that I don't think I'll get to have this again any time soon. I did struggle a bit with getting to the bone marrow and eventually caved and asked for a straw, which worked great."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",3,24-Mar-23,"Their online info said they opened at 7a. We showed up at 8a and the proprietor was rude and said they opened at 9a. We were willing to wait and asked if they had vegetarian options like we saw online. Again, he was rude and said no, they did not have vegetarian options. In unrelated news, nice views of the mosque from here."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,11-Apr-19,"This restaurant came highly recommended for Indian food. Since our family was visiting the Sultan Mosque, Zam Zam was a perfect choice, since it was right across the street from the mosque. We were seated on the second floor of the restaurant, which had air conditioning. Yay. There were many tables to be seated at. But, the tables were too close to each other. So, it felt quite cramped.  Our waiter arrived to take our order. We got the mutton murtabak, mutton biryani, and pulled hot milk tea. Everything that we ordered was delicious. The murtabak tasted like an eggy, floury pancake with tons of flavorful mutton inside. Also, the rice in the biryani had a great fluffy texture. They didn't skimp on the mutton in this dish either. What I was quite impressed with was the pulled milk tea. It was such an aromatic tea, and had the right amount of sweet condensed milk. It was even better than the best pulled milk tea I've had in Hong Kong.  The only thing was that the customer service was quite brutish here. It's probably best to be very direct with what you want to order. You can point to the menu items you want to get. Also, be sure to confirm your orders too, since our waiter initially got our order wrong. He had to flag down another waiter to help him make sure our order was correct. Otherwise, when I visit Singapore again, I'll definitely be back here for their delicious food and milk tea."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,16-Jan-21,"Are people really complaining about the service? It's an old school Indian Muslim restaurant that's here to serve you delicious food, not chat with you about your day and check up every 5 mins to see how your food tastes. Get the local experience and order food with no frills (even if that means getting your own water).  Anyways, this place has become a bit touristy (see my point above), but my local friends still come here for one reason and one reason only. The murtabak. The mutton murtabak + teh tarik has been my winning combo and it's what brings me back every time I'm in town."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,20-Jan-20,"I've been on a Martabak craze since I landed in SIN about a 5 days ago. And I had to go to this place. Their Indian Martabak is really good. It's close to what I remembered all those years ago in Indonesia. However, I think the Indo Indian Martabak had other things in it besides just meat and the martabak itself. Regardless, love this place.  The Cik that was helping me was a little terse, but nice enough to hook this brother up w/ a martabak at close to 11 PM. Terima kasih Cik."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,3-Sep-18,"Authentic Murtabak and briyani, according my Friend from Saudi Arabia! My first time trying the cuisine and it was delicious! We finished all of our food and ordered a second mutton murtabak cuz it was that good Teh ice (iced milk tea) is a must try as well"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,13-Jun-18,"Zam Zam, thank you, Ma'am. This place is right on Arab Street, directly in front of the Sultan Mosque. The specialization here is biryani and murtabak.  I found the biryani to be on the bare side. It's got a good mix of spices for complexity, and although the mutton was tender and easy to peel, I've had better. Murtabak is very good. The deer option is their popular one, and it's good. It's an ideal shareable item. It's pretty bulky, and it's filling. They're generous with the meat portion inside. Also, you can try the fish head curry. My opinion? It's just okay. It makes for a good picture, but I found the actual fish to be rather tough- not as flaky/peel-able.  This place has been featured on some travel programs, and it's also a popular YouTube travel vlog destination. That said, despite being a legitimate landmark mamak shop, I'll say that the food is good, but not amazingly outstanding as I initially expected. If you're from Malaysia, you probably will not be impressed, and there's a 90% chance you'll say/brag to some extent about how the mamak food in Malaysia is better than Singapore. Otherwise, this food will probably blow your tourist mind away. It's good though."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",2,22-Dec-18,"2.5 stars Singapore Zam Zam is a busy, busy ""Indian Muslim food"" restaurant near Bugis. There's open air seating on the first floor and a much larger air conditioned dining room on the second floor. To eat, we started with the mutton biryani, which was a pile of basmati rice with a tender piece of mutton in the center and a creamy curry on the side. Though tasty, I found the rice to be rather bland (compared to some other biryanis I've had), since it wasn't actually cooked with the meat or with many spices. We also had the special deer murtabak, a stuffed flatbread filled with ground deer and egg. Overall, the murtabak was rather bland and flavorless--it came with a curry on the side for dipping, but otherwise had almost no flavor. On the plus side, the portion sizes here were definitely generous for the price, but I can't say I get the hype about Zam Zam."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,4-Nov-19,"They have indoor and outdoor seating. I elected to sit outside, as it is located right across from some historic buildings in Little India/Arab Street. It's a great spot for people watching over lunch.  The staff are very friendly. I'm an indecisive eater when it comes to new menus, and they were able to make really helpful (and delicious) recommendations. If you're the appetite bigger than your actual stomach type like me, you can dine in and order take out at the same time. The staff are super helpful with that.  This is also located in the optimal spot for anyone who has some time to take a stroll through the rest of Little India/Arab Street. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to other tourists who are in the area!"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,9-Sep-19,"If you've never had murtabak, definitely give it a try! It's delicious even without the dipping sauce. I wanted to try the venison murtabak, but they only have it on certain days. The lamb version was great though. The mutton biryani is quite flavorful as well."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,21-Aug-16,"The food here is soooo good. My friend and I saw that this place got great reviews so we decided to give it a try and we were not disappointed.  Service isn't the best and the servers aren't the nicest, but the food definitely makes up for it. Don't overlook this place based on its appearance. It's located right beside the famous Arab street, so for tourists like myself and my friend we could easily work over to explore the area right after we finished our meal. A walk is also necessary after such a carb-heavy meal.  Tourists and non-tourists alike have to try this place out!"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,26-Sep-18,"We found Singapore Zam Zam on the Lonely Planet guidebook. We wanted to try the Murtabak - a Halal Malaysian stuffed Pancake. We had a choice of Beef , Mutton , Chicken or Sardines .  We chose the Chicken Murtabak.  The Chicken Murtabak was excellent with the gravy sauce that came on a separate bowl. The Murtabak was otherwise bland tasting without the gravy.  The iced coffee was refreshing and complemented the Murtabak- they have a system to determine which coffee drink had milk versus none, sugar versus sugar free.  I recommend stopping for at least a snack at Zam Zam when visiting Kampong Glam in Singapore ."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,12-Dec-17,"Must go restaurant when you are visiting Haji lane. Very authentic Muslim food and price is cheap too.  I think most of the tourist and local people eat at this location..  There is 1st floor and 2nd floor.. If you are seated on 1st floor, ask the server to be seated at second floor since there is Air Condition. I noticed that restaurant employees seats local people on 1st floor and tourists on 2nd floor.  I tried biryani, murtsbak and fish head curry. Love the sauce when you eat with biryani. Great combination."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",2,14-Apr-17,"Stay away from the fruit drinks, which for some reason, though Zam Zam resides in a tropical country chock full of cheap tropical fruit like all the neighboring restaurants, chooses to serve its 'blueberry juice' with neon blue Gatorade-looking syrup, and then have the gall to tell me, 'it's blueberries!' No it isn't. Stop.  The mutton murtabak is fairly tasty, and is really helped out by the savory dal (complete with sheep-meat chunk to flavor it), but they really skimp on the meat, filling the pastry mostly with onions. For $9, I expect some meat, particularly in a city where $9 usually gets you full to bursting. Mutton is a strongly flavored meat, and if I have to cock my head and concentrate to taste it, you're not using enough."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,20-Mar-20,"Was lucky to get a seat as I stopped by with a group just as a fasting period was coming to an end. The place was full, and due to the holiday we were supposed to have put in an order earlier that day. This left the only item on the menu to be the murtabak. At first the group was a bit disappointed but then the murtabaks arrived. I was stunned at how delicious they were, and with the slight spice of the dipping sauce, they disappeared from everyone's plate in a matter of minutes and they are fairly large! Definitely worth a trip!"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,29-Nov-19,"Tried something new on Arab Street!

Friendly staff explained the menu and food was out in less than 5 minutes."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,22-Jun-16,"I heard amazing reviews about their Murtabak so I had to try one before leaving Singapore. It worked out perfectly since I also wanted to visit the Sultan Mosque.  You can order it for take-out or eat inside their restaurant. The venue itself isn a bit run-down and the service isn't the best but their Murtabak is delicious! I ordered their SMALL Chicken Murtabak. It reminds me of ""Chinese dan-bing?"". I told the server that we wanted a small since we had breakfast not too long ago. The small is suppose to be $6 but when I saw the bill, the gentlemen charged us $8, SOOOOO I assume that he gave us the medium-sized Murtabak. It's quite filling for a party of three! (Unless you are famished, you might want to also order an additional dish). The Murtakbak comes with a dipping sauce (very watered down.. Reminds me of a curry taste) and cucumbers with some red sweet sauce (?). Compliments well with the Murtabak.  I also ordered their house drink, Vanilla Kathira. You have to order it in a bottle. Reminds me of really sweet vanilla soy milk. I enjoyed it!  TRY IT WHEN YOU ARE IN SINGAPORE!"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,8-May-13,"Zam Zam is pretty much an institution for murtabak and briyani having been around for years though I only know of it a few years ago.But pretty much everyone has heard of Zam Zam and it can get crowded even late at night. There are more tables upstairs to accommodate the diners.  We were lucky to get a table at 7 pm as the rain probably kept people away.  We shared the chicken murtabak and mutton briyani. Both were really good. The murtabak was huge and full of chicken pieces. I was expecting a flattish murtabak which was my experience at other joints so this was a surprise.  The mutton was very tender and you could cut it with your fork. The rice was flavorful with the mutton and the gravy was just perfect too.  Teh halia was another winner though if you dislike sugar, you will probably need to ask them to reduce it. For me, that is what a typical teh is. Sweet to wash down a heavy meal, and you don't even need dessert after that."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,15-Jan-17,"Decent food at a fair price, service is passable.  The murtabak has multiple thin layers of dough that are somewhat chewy, rather than crisp. It's pretty filling and tasty. The $7 beef murtabak is definitely a good/large sized-meal for one person. In between the layers of dough are ground beef and onion - but the flavor is fairly mild overall.  I'd recommend using the fork and spoon to tear the murtabak into bite sized pieces, and then using the spoon to dip the pieces into the curry. The murtabak by itself is actually pretty mild in flavor and has a nice chewy texture. The dough is spread very thin but it has to have enough gluten to do that so the chew is nice.  The curry has a mild body, isn't too heavy on the coconut, and is very dense in flavor. It's got good chili flavor, some heat, and some tang. Really tasty with the murtabak and really amps up the flavor.  Skip the coffee. Seriously, not worth getting. Tastes like stale Maxwell House.  The service here is a little iffy - the best tip is just to be vocal about what you want and when you want it, otherwise you'll be sitting patiently for a while."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,15-Apr-18,"Singapore Zam Zam, just North of the city center, is a neighborhood staple serving a variety of middle eastern and Muslim Singaporean food. The price are reasonable and the building reminds me of late night spots in Pittsburgh. It's very casual and right by the local mosque. There's outside seating on the street and air conditioning on the second floor.  Everybody goes for the murtabak. It's a cross between a crepe and an omelet stuffed with spiced meat and vegetables. You rip off a piece and dip it in a curry. This thing is delicious. Big time flavor and very filling. We got some mee goreng which they did a great job with too. You can get a huge meal for a great price and I'd highly recommend it."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,6-Oct-19,Loved the food. I was visiting Sultan Mosque and read reviews of zam zam.. it is right across from the mosque. Never had murtabak before so tried mutton biryani and murtabak and it was great. Very reasonable prices and great food.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,23-Apr-16,"We were nearby and decided to pop into Zam Zam as hubby has heard much about it.  We ordered: * Beef Murtabak - Crispy outside and generous inside with beef and onion bits. $5 for a small one but fills you up! Good size for the price.  * Egg Onion Prata - they don't have kosong Prata so I opted for egg onion to up the flavour! Like the Murtabak, the Prata is crispy and tasty! What's particularly even more yummy was the fish curry!! It's really good that I asked for TWO more top-ups!! The Prata curry combo is power!!  * Chicken Biryani - we were not hungry but just greedy so we ordered a chicken biryani to share. Great decision as the rice alone is al dente and flavourful. The chicken is with not much sauce that I initially thought it would be too dry a plate to get maximum enjoyment. I was wrong! Every mouth a delight and I ate more than I said I was gonna eat. Heh  * Teh Halia - this is my usual go-to drink and theirs didn't disappoint. Thick and sweet and gingery. Just the way I love it!!!  The shop itself is a visual delight. Many things to see on the walls and around. Only after the meal did I realise that they have an Aircon upstairs. And they are apparently so famous that they made their own Zam Zam signs for patrons to take selfies with. They also sell their own bottled water!! And also their Zam Zam Polo Tee if you like!!! Amazing!  Well, I'm just there for the food."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",3,4-Feb-22,"Your go to when your have cravings in the wee hours. And no craving for western, more on East asian ""snacks"" / bites."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,26-May-18,"Delicious Indian food! Had the prawn curry which was with tomato chili paste and onions. Mutton Murtubak was really flavorful, it was like egg and naan stuffed with onions and ground mutton. Fish Biryanis was fragrant and flavorful!"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,26-Nov-17,Chicken murtabak- almost pastry like. Definitely the highlight! Chicken biryani- comes with curry sauce. Ice lychee tea Everything was so flavorful and delicious. Price is very reasonable too. Less than $20 SGD for two people.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,21-Sep-15,"If you haven't been yet, this is a 100+ year old institution of Singapore. If you have to try couple of things, I recommend the mutton biryani (hayderabadi dum biryani where the meat is hidden under the rice and there is plenty of it), and the chicken murtabak. The later is made with Ghee, purified butter, can be a little heavy if you are not used to it. The beef masala is very good too. There is a broad range of teas (teh) and local drinks, great to sample! The food is plenty enough for 2 and cost S$20.  The restaurant has had a facelift, new stairs, upstairs is air conditioned, brighter lights, new flooring and nice and bright photos of dishes. The walls have had a good scrub so it's nice and shiny!  This is my 3rd visit, and am sure is not the last, great place for a good hearty meal."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,13-May-18,Great food. Super cheap but cash only and you'll be sitting close to your neighbors :-).  Get the Murtabak - it's incredible.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",3,22-Sep-17,"We came here stranded by the rain and decided to try a Zam Zams. We got the lamb murtabak and an iced coffee. The coffee was a weak nesquick with a malted milk after taste, the murtabak for me was ok. It's the equivalent of an Indian paratha but with ground lamb inside and comes with a dipping sauce. Unfortunately I'm allergic to a spice used in the dipping sauce and my throat got itchy and started closing up which ruined the remainder of the meal for me. Not like I got much in since there was so much filling I dropped half on the way to my mouth. Next time I'd get the murtabak alone with a spatula to transport it into my mouth"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",3,18-May-17,"Chicken murtabak was the best dish of the meal. It comes in small, medium, or large, and a small size is good for one person. The roti was nicely browned and the chicken was moist with lots of flavor.  We also tried the fish biriyani, but the fish was rather dry and the rice was intermittently flavored -- perhaps it was supposed to be like that, but I would have liked a more complex flavor. The curry that came with it also tasted mildly of lamb, which was a bit off putting.  The iced teh chio was quite yummy, but my friend said the teh c wasn't sweet enough. Also, the tea was still piping hot when they iced it, making the bottom warm while the top cold, which made for a rather inconsistent drink.  Service was spotty at best -- we were sitting right by the staircase where there were constantly waiters running back and forth, yet it was almost impossible to catch anyone's attention.  It's possible that Zam Zam may have been a top-notch joint at some point, but like many other restaurants, complacence and laziness took over, making the food passionless and mediocre."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",1,17-Sep-17,Awful experience from start to finish. Came around noon for lunch. There were roaches crawling on the walls. It takes forever to flag down someone to place the order. Service is practically nonexistent. They were out of roti which was the main reason we came. The complementary curry was the only tasty food we tried.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,15-Jun-19,Best Indian food that I had in Singapore. I'd eat here every week if I could. Yum. Every dish we tried was great.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,28-Jul-17,"Just the way I remember... After 12 years, I m back to the MOTHERLAND.. for a visit... This time around, I purchased 2 small lamb (mutton) murtabak @ $6 each, while the beef murtabak was $5. I ask the staff who handled my purchased for the gravy Dhal instead of the curry that they offer. My family often came here to purchase murtabak to go, for special ocassions or to feed families members who came for a visit or its easy to feed a crowd with the murtabak purchase. This time around, both my Mum and I do not fancy the slices of cucumber filled with the ketchup. The slices of cucumber tasted ""old"" and it tasted quite bad. Hence for the ketchup cucumber we threw it away. As for the Murtabak, it did not disappoint. With the purchased, both my Aunts who now lived in Malaysia, also enjoyed the Murtabak.. as good as they can even remember. All in all Zam Zam restaurant, is our to go murtabak stall/vendor that has been our family favorite."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",3,9-Jun-19,"This is a good place to go for a quick-fix of mutton biryani. Despite being very popular, I find their food to be on the average side. Don't expect a quite place where you can enjoy sitting down to talk with your friends. Zam Zam is more like an oversized street food establishment with a roof on our top."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",2,28-Dec-16,"I was looking forward to this place based off the reviews but it's very greasy and low quality. Tried chicken murtabak, deer, and some beef. All so so and so greasy and flavorless. I really wanted to like it but I'd rather eat at the hawker market or the mall food court or orchard Rd. It's a lively and interesting place right across from the sultan mosque in the Arab street area. Maybe they make good tea or something else. Sigh"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,22-Nov-17,Enjoyed plate of chicken biryani and prata with tasty sweet black coffee. Wonderful flavors and outstanding service. A must visit for the taste of India in Singapore.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,23-Feb-18,Been going to Zam Zam for over 30 years The mutton murtabak and milk coffee is as good as the first visit in the 80s. A must for any visit to Singapore.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,25-Dec-16,"How can't I love this place! Cheap and good food. From most of my experience, don't expect too much of television shows have introduced the place so many times. This is because there might be so many customers and it makes food and service quality bad. I have to admit that there are many customers. However, the food is still good. If you prefer to eat in a quiet place, then this is not your place. However, if you would like to try good food during traveling, come! A must place in Singapore."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,25-Dec-19,"Yes. Definitely yes. Good eats and reasonably priced. We had the mutton BRIYANI and deer MURTABAK. They provide complimentary curry on the side. It was delicious. It is located in Little India. I highly suggest going to this restaurant instead of one of the restaurants in Little India's main streets (Haji Lane and Arab St) because they are so overpriced. The food here is tasty tasty tasty. You will see a lot of locals here which is a good sign. It was a good find for us. Enjoyed it. Go upstairs, there is air conditioning!!!"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,11-Aug-16,"I'm surprised by the people who said service is slow?? I walked up at 12:30 on a weekday when everyone and their mom was out for lunch and I was seated right away and attended to faithfully the entire time I was there. The servers were so nice, too.  I had never heard of murtabak before but I decided to try it since this is what the place is known for. It was soooo good! I have an annoying amount of self control when it comes to food, ie I stop before I'm full (I get food coma times a million so I just can't), but I actually ate the entire plate of murtabak. I never do that! It was so crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with tons of chicken. I couldn't believe it was only 5 dollars. Seriously me cleaning my plate is a testament to how good it was as I can never usually do that! Yum!  The iced tea came with limes in it which I had never had before and it went really well with the meal.  I am already thinking about going back for dinner, ha!! Definitely check this place out if you're in the Arab quarter wandering around and need a bite.  But I DID get major food coma, as I knew I would, so grab some coffee on your way out and wander around and digest :-)"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,22-Mar-17,"Hit the place as it opened. No lines, fast and excellent service. Fresh, crispy-yet-doughy murtabak (chicken), fish-head soup, prata to deal with the soup and iced coffee. Sooooooo good!!! Didn't need to eat again till late in evening. The murtabak really is filling and sticks to your ribs like a ""Denver boot!"" My husband is the best and cleaned up whatever I couldn't. Fair price, fresh, flavorful and fast... fantastic!!!!!!"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,2-Dec-19,"As good as the hype said, but service was a little spotty. Be prepared to be accosted on the street as you walk up and pressured into ordering before you look at the menu. The small is huge, so be prepared for a food coma..."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,11-Nov-19,"Amazing service, everyone is extremely friendly and the food comes relatively quickly. Tried the beef murtabek, chicken biryani, and mutton curry, all were excellent. The chicken was succulent and the sauce from the mutton curry was really flavorful."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,30-May-17,The chicken murtabak is fried well and is delicious. The mutton biryani is also tasty. It opens at 9am but their is a waiting line already around 8:30am. Smells good and not really spicy. Come and enjoy These foods here. Oh Teh Ice is a little sweet. That is fine.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,5-Apr-18,"The murdock(?) and the milk tea were DELICIOUS!!! And the prices were soooo reasonable. Ambiance is non-existent, but the place is packed and the food is good. Close to MRT, great place to stop for a good meal."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",3,25-Apr-18,"3.5 stars. I really liked the flavor of the chicken murtabak although my brother preferred the beef. Seating upstairs during lunch time was a hustle-and-bustle rub-your-elbows kind of style. The staff in our area worked very efficiently to seat people, take orders, and bus the tables for the next patrons."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,22-Feb-16,"It's definitely local food you'll find here. I like to bring my friends here when they visit for a taste of Singapore - the murtabak is the best EVER and a MUST EAT. Service isn't the best because they can be SLOW but it's worth the wait. Prices aren't the cheapest but the murtabak is worth the price.  It's also across the road from Haji Lane and Sultan Mosque, which are worth a visit if you're around."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,18-Dec-16,"What can I say about this place it's the best place and must go to when you are in Singapore love love love this country, people and food you can find all kind of food Halal food so Muslims don't have to rely on seafood only"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",2,28-Feb-16,"Really disappointing past few experiences here. I used to come here maybe 4-5 years ago and the murtabak was always fresh and good. Past few times, the murtabak have been dry, stale and clearly ""pre-made"" long beforehand. It was barely even hot.  I get that things in a restaurant kitchen need to be done a certain way to avoid having to wait ages for each dish, but for a restaurant that specialises - and is known for - this stuff, they should be able to crank them out endlessly.  I keep thinking ""I'll go back and give them one more try..."" But have been disappointed again and again.  As others have said, service is painfully slow, but you're not at a fine dining place here.  Maybe I'll try the other mamak restaurant a few doors up...."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,28-Jul-15,"Certainly a worthy trip to this place for good local Indian food. Must try for the fish head curry, Mutton a-la carte, mutton Murtakbak, nasi biriyani, cuttlefish and their tea tarik! The place has been around a long time, have a nostalgic feel to it, but also mean unassuming plastic plates,,plastic cups and steel utensil. So much for ambience. Price is definitely good. If you are game for Indian spice and stuff, their fish curry and Murtakbak is a must try. Upstair is air conditioned should help beat the heat."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",3,11-Jan-16,"Even though I enjoyed the mutton murtabak, I didn't think it was spectacular. The meat was a little dry and the dish could be warmer. Cleanliness seems to evade this place as the plates, utensils, tables, and chairs have that dusty/half-washed look.  I would come back again with friends, since there are so many shareable dishes here."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,12-Oct-16,"First time trying murtabak and it was very good. I had the one stuffed with chicken. The pancake surrounding the filling was thin and had a nice taste of eggs. The filling was lightly spicy with tomato like sauce/curry inside, chicken and onions and possibly other things I can't recall. All very yummy."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,7-Apr-15,"This gets five stars for what it is, a local Indian shop, not all five stars are the same; this is cheap tasty and casual five star. This is where I was first introduced to Murtabak and it has spoiled all others to follow. This is an Indian Muslim restaurant that specializes in Murtabak and Biryani, and it does both well, although it makes it's name with the Murtabak. Their Murtabak is fantastic, cooked just crispy enough, stuffed with egg, onion, and garlic; but it isn't too greasy. You can get it filled with Chicken, Mutton, Beef, Deer or Sardine and also vegetarian; I recommend the chicken. It is served with a tasty, slightly spicy curry that is great for dipping. They also serve other typical mamak shop foods such as nasi goreng and mee goreng, both made in the bright red Malay style. All the food came out great, but beware, eat this for lunch and you will have a tough time staying awake in the afternoon as it is heavy and tasty."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,24-Jan-14,"Upon many recommendations, I got the deer murtabak and mutton biryani. Both were fantastic choices and a lot for two people. I would say it's perfect for 2.5 people.  The murtabak comes with two different curry sauces which complements the main dish nicely and softens up the crispiness of the roti. The mutton biryani comes with one big piece, slightly chewy at some parts, but the pickled vegetable sides rounded out the dish.  We also got iced coffee which we found is typically brewed hot upon order then iced before it hits your table so it's lukewarm. I don't mind that at all because it'll eventually get cold.  There aren't too many tables in here and it's indoors with an open front so you get the breeze from outside along the hustle and bustle of the streets. I love eating at these types of places."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,27-Oct-15,"This place is highly recommended by local and tourists. My favorite dish is beef briyani. They never let me down every time I ordered. They do offer murtabak, prata and chops, but beef briyani is the one and the only I would order without fail  The beef is so tender, with a little bit of spicy. Yum yum yum  The service is very fast, sit down order, they serve food within 10 mins."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,29-May-14,"Have to say that this place actually lives up to its hype. I wasn't planning on stopping here but as I walked down the sidewalk with that ""yes I'm Tourist"" look on my face, I was being ushered into a restaurant by some guy in a blue shirt standing in the middle of the sidewalk. At first I responded with a quick ""I'm good thanks"", but then the smells and happy noises coming from inside the restaurant caught my attention. So I realized blue shirt is actually a ZamZam employee and he was there to make sure you didn't miss the restaurant.  Side note: the upstairs is chilled, so ask to go upstairs if the first floor is too hot or too crowded. So I go in, ordered a feast as you can see, the fish dish covered in a spicy red sauce was my favorite. Wow that was great!! The calamari was ok, a bit chewy but missing a strong flavor, I think if it was made to order it would be exceptional. The mutton biryani.... well it appears they cook the biryani on its own then if u want mutton/lamb, chicken, fish etc that just dig the appropriate protein outta the pot and into a plate then scope the biryani over the protein. The actual rice dish was great, the lamb...meh. overall I would give the entire mutton biryani a 6.5, cheap enough to order again but wouldn't cry if they were sold out.  The fish head curry, I honestly can't review. I was so full from everything else and that dish was so HUGE I didn't know where to start. I did pick a pea sized portion of the fish and I gave the whole dish to some homeless guys on the corner. Going off their facial expressions, sound effects and speed: when they realized what they had, removing the packaging, and digging in, I would give the fish dish a 9. Maybe next time I will judge it a bit better.  Overall great experience I never planned to have."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",3,1-Dec-15,"I had my first good murtabak here. shared with my ex classmates over a cup of tea tarik or Bandung.  Whenever I'm here, I'm with a group. I do associate this place with bonding sessions.  Extremely painful wait for service for many years.But when my friend did a takeaway, it was speedy.  Standard of food is on and off. sometimes good or mostly acceptable"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,4-Dec-14,"Morning murtabak hit you say? I'm there!  Running on a later time zone in Singapore is tricky, because most places open after 11am. Thankfully we found out that Zam Zam is serving up fresh breakfast roti nice from 7am, so we beelined here for a cheap Indian breakfast.  Mid-morning it was already busy, so they sent us straight upstairs, which was cooler and less cramped than downstairs. The set up is pretty basic, but it was actually more comfortable than I expected!  We ordered chicken and deer murtabak. The chicken was definitely my favourite, filled with delicious bright orange tandoori chicken. Deer wasn't bad, but a tad dry and I probably wouldn't order it again. Both were quite large and filling, definitely satisfying out craving for the kind of breakfast we couldn't get at home in Melbourne."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,4-May-18,Delicious food in a no fuss setting. It can get hot if you sit downstairs. There was a mix of locals and tourists eating here just after nine in the morning.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",3,27-Jun-15,One of the oldest places for roti prata in singapore. But I dont like their approach towards business. You cannot order plain prata for breakfast. Egg is the minimum. And this is pre made. Next you cannot ask for more than one curry. Only thing good is the murtabak where they add mutton bits on the outside of the prata too.. There are many newer places that make a better prata and tastier curries. Will only come if there is no other option.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,21-Aug-18,Delicious food and the murtabak and briyani were our favorite. Ask the server for vegetarian options. Service was very fast.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,25-Nov-14,"Zam Zam Salabim, is all I can say. This restaurant is truly enchanting, as it offers amazing halal Indian breakfast. It may look simple, but it tastes fantastic.  We order different pancakes (with cheese, onions and lamb stuffed), which correctly are called Prata here. They actually rather remind me of puff pastry than pancakes. Anyway, the way of eating Pratas: you rip off a piece of them and dip it into tasty veggie, fish or meat curry sauce. What a heavenly mess!  In addition to the Pratas, the Biryani is the signature dish of Zam Zam. The main component of these dishes is flavored rice. It will come with spicy roasted meat. You can also order a vegetarian version, of course. The rice is roasted with a good amount of onions, chilies and nut. Sometimes they will add a few raisins. Biryani is often served with yogurt and mango chutney."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,1-Mar-15,Had a nice Chicken Briyani and mutton Murtabak. So far one of the best of Singapore. A must try during your journey in Arab Street and Sultan mosquee. The kweo tweo wasn't so good.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,28-Oct-13,"Zam Zam is where grandpa brought dad for murtabak. And where my dad brought me. This place is a Singapore icon  Hands down the best murtabak in Singapore. Especially if you know how to order it.  Get the regular size, no the large. It fries up better. Add extra mutton and egg. Have them fry it crispy.  They have fish and/or chicken curry sauce. I like the fish.  They also have jumbo curry prawns. Those are amazing. Definitely try them.  Also try the mee goreng, mutton briyani and assorted dishes with rice.  RTE every time I'm in Singapore."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,25-Jun-14,"Me and couple of my buddies were in singapore for 3 days and decided to visit the arab street and try some saudi arabian cuisine . Although we had not heard much about zam zam , right after checking out the sultan mosque as we passed this place, some of the indian workers called out to us in native tongue and urged us to check this place out. I have tried malabari cuisine in india as well (surprisingly many excellent moslem hotels in india are named zam zam, zam zam being the name of the well in mecca). malabari is remotely derived from saudi arabian and tastes similar. Zam zam served both arabian and traditional singaporean dishes. We decided to try out the murtabak ( saudi arabian dish , (paratha) stuffed with fired onion , cucumber, tomato , lamb/beef /chicken or deer. Since many workers were from south india , they helped us with the best out of the menu and we ended up getting a beef, lamb and deer murtabak with a biriyani and traditional sweet milk singaporean tea served with ice.  It tasted so good and rich that i salivated a bit now writing this sentence. But beware it is basically super heavy food. after having one murtabak you are expected to cross a desert . We washed it down with the sweet milk tea which was not bad. but murtabak is a must try here. Its been 1 year since i visited and it still fills my senses with its unique flavor when i think about it. ""I have always wanted to eat one with grated coconut mixed with lamb in it"". probably next time when iam in Calicut, India  Pros 1. Exxxcellent food (say murtabak) 2. Quick service 3.Cheap 4. A variety of choices 5. it is basically arabia for your palate.  Cons 1.Crowded 2. irregular seating arrangement 3.Hot,sweaty 4. Not the cleanest around.  A must try."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,19-Jan-18,The food is excellent! Reasonable price. Must try if you're into this type of cuisine.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,5-Jan-18,Love their Martabak. The best. The guys who work there are nice and friendly. They are very swift with the order. It can be very crowded but it's worth it.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,12-Apr-14,Recommended by a friend! I wouldn't know what to order otherwise since I don't often eat Malay food! I ordered the sardines murtabak and teh tarik. Both are delicious! I will recommend this restaurant to you too!
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,7-Sep-12,"When I worked in the neighbourhood, this was one of my favourite spots for lunch. The prices are reasonable, and you can get a delicious meal for just a couple of dollars. My personal favourite is the masala dosai which is filled with chunky spiced vegetables and accompanied by a really good coconut chutney.  The briyani stand is worth a shot, too, and it does cost a little more than some other items, but it's a very generous portion.  Not much ambience to speak of, but this is the kind of place where you have your fill and then move on anyways."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,11-May-13,"A friend in Singapore introduced me to this place - it's awesome. Mutton murtabak is delicious. Great local crowd here too, it's always packed, but turns over fast, and there's more room upstairs. I've eaten here a bunch of times and always enjoyed it."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",3,18-Oct-14,"Stopped in since the place I intended to check out was closed and because I had heard of this place previously. Had the deer murtabak. The meat was ground, and pretty much indistinguishable as being deer (could have been beef or lamb for all I could tell). The murtabak was far less greasy than what I had experienced elsewhere, and the sauce that came with it was nice and spicy. Head upstairs for the air conditioning to escape the heat and humidity (and be prepared to share a communal table if they are busy).  Overall it was good, not great. With a million interesting places to experience amazing food in Singapore I can check this one off my list but probably would not make a special trip to come back."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,1-Oct-13,"My 2nd visit. I love this place. If and when I leave SG, this will be on my bucket list before flying out.  2 words = murtabak heaven!"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",2,16-Feb-17,Staff was rude to us for simply asking for tissue paper. Not specially worth a trip as far as taste.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",1,23-Mar-19,"The food here is overpriced. The fish dish costs $20 and it's not worth the price. The server is rude and kept rushing us up for ordering. He took the menu from my friend without saying a word, while she was still reading it."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,5-Mar-14,"We have heard so many good things about Zam Zam that our time to visit here was well overdue. One night last week we caught a Fast Blue into the city and got dropped off right across from Zam Zam. We expected it to be busy and it met our expectations. However the super efficient staff found us a table on the second floor which is a little cooler than the first level.  We ordered lime juice to drink along with a Chicken Murtabak and Mee Goreng. The Murtabak is one of the more famous dishes from their menu, the Mee Goreng not so famous. The food arrived quickly courtesy of the super efficient staff.  The Murtabak was every bit as good as we expected, with a great curry to dip the entire extravaganza in. The Mee Goreng was so so with the chicken a little over cooked like you see in Chicken 65.  The super efficient* staff brought our bill and we paid and were gone within 30 mins, wandering into the funky wonderment of Haji Lane and Arab street.  We will definitely go back to Zam Zam, for sure to have the Murtabak again, and perhaps the Briyani which also seems to get excellent reviews.  *the super efficient staff comments are actually meant as a compliment. It's not elegant service, but it's fast and accurate and actually of a standard you rarely see in Singapore"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,9-Aug-12,"This is the place to go to for your murtabak cravings.  I prefer the chicken murtabak to the beef and mutton ones. The restaurant uses large pieces of moist chicken leg in their chicken murtabak, not the scrappy shreds in many neighbourhood stalls. Look out for chicken bones in your murtabak though, lest you choke. I've found a few small ones in mine before. The dough is soft and chewy. They are simply unbeatable, crispy and soft inside with liberal amounts of filling.  Their briyani tastes just as good. Each moist rice grain is heavily spiced and the meat comes totally smothered in rich gravy. Portions are damn huge.  The other dishes served are not as notable as their famous murtabak and briyani. Just stick to what they're good at."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",3,1-Sep-12,"Located along the stretch of mosque street, this place basically serves the working crowd around the vicinity. The interior is normal, just like any eatery stall. It has two storeys and you might want to go to the second level as the air conditioning is much better up there.  They serve nice Indian Muslim cuisine, food to try, their chicken bryani. The serving is big and the chicken is well coated with their home made gravy. You can try the mutton bryani too but personally I prefer the chicken bryani as the mutton meat might be over cooked at times.  Another dish to try would be the roti prata , yes how can we miss this dish in an Indian stall. The plain prata is crispy and not too oily, do request for the fish curry instead as it tastes much better than the original.  Price is pretty affordable for the working crowd, value for money."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,20-Jan-14,Great place for a nosh and sit. Murtabaks the size of a phone book. Air-con on the 2nd floor.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",3,13-Jun-14,"Interestingly, I'm not really sure how I feel about this place despite its claim to fame as being the oldest (and most famous?) place for murtabak in Singapore. We ordered the ground lamb murtabak and it was fine but I wasn't blown away. The mee goreng, however, was very good. I did notice that the taste was a little bit on the sweet side compared to the Malaysian-style mee goreng which is more savory in flavor. The different is not good or bad thing, but just a difference that I noticed in the mee goreng preparation. The roti prata was passable at best-- the saving grace was being able to dip it into the side of chicken curry."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",3,14-Nov-10,"If you want to try the Malay cuisine, try this restaurant or its neighbor, the New Victory Restaurant. These are both places with a looong history, going back to the beginning of the 20th century and both offer similar dishes like chicken or mutton murtabak (a mixture of minced lamb, egg and onion in a thin dough (what is the name of that Tunesian dough again?). Very good. I am told that the variation with sardines is also worth trying. There is a local custard for dessert.   Now don't expect a nice quiet dining experience: people are queuing outside to get in, tables are small, it is noisy and smelly, but you have to take this in your stride as part of the experience. That's why I didn't give 4 stars.."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,25-Aug-15,"Murtabak was a delight, beef and chicken both. Fish curry sauce is essential to accent these flavors, you may have to ask for it twice."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,21-Nov-14,"Century old shop, yet entirely unassuming. For $10 I had the most delicious Indian food of my life. Admittedly this is not an area in which Im expert, but both the briyani and masala were seasoned and spiced perfectly for my taste."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",3,18-Dec-14,"This is my go-to place after getting a haircut from a nearby salon. I'm here not just because of the food, but the memories and the history the place holds. The place is usually filled with people. There's always something going on. Do try the bryani or the murtabak."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,25-Feb-16,"This place was solid. We ordered the Mutton murtabak, beef bee hoon goreng, and chicken briyani. All worked well together but also different while incorporating a wide variety of tastes. The price point is just great. Highly recommend"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,5-Oct-14,"Stopped in at the recommendation of my barber right down the street. Fantastic selection of good Indian food served up quick! The fish curry was done extremely well, the fish was fresh and tender, pulling right off the bone (beware of bones) and the curry over rice was just right. The pork murtabak was fried perfectly, crispy on the outside, soft and delicious on the inside! definitely stop here if you get a chance!"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,9-Oct-15,One of my favorite places for Muslim food. Love their bryani! It's not cheap though and it's often full house. But it's worth going once in a while.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,6-Apr-15,Great place - went there for the first time tonight. The murtabak is the best. The service surprisingly was good as well
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,22-Mar-15,Heavenly Murtabak. Take a walk down haji lane and wind up with dinner at zam zam. Makes a great breakfast lunch or dinner
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",3,18-Jan-15,"Food was good and prices alright. Atmosphere is very anonymous however. When you enter you are seated by one staff member, another one takes your order, another one brings your food and another one gives you the bill. Kinda felt like a mass processing cafeteria..."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,15-Feb-15,"Watch out for tourist in the lion city. :) scouting around bugis for good food and first restaurant that caught our eyes is the Zam Zam restaurant. Had a quick look in yelp before we decided our mind on this restaurant to satisfy the hunger of Asian food especially the yummy roti prata. Since it is dinner time, the only food you can order is murtabak or nasi biryani. Both are signature dishes of the restaurant. We ordered murtabak with chicken filling ($6) for a small one and a plate of nasi biryani (rice) with mutton ($6.50)... double yummy! When the foods are served we couldn't wait for another min to dig in. Food delicious :) and there are two rooms upstairs with air conditioned so the dining experience is really great. We going to come back here for breakfast before we leave :)"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",2,30-Aug-15,"I'm quite disappointed by the disclaimer in this restaurant. It clearly says that all the murtabak are cooked in 1 pan and they are not responsible in case there's a mixture of meat. So, strict no no...for people who don't eat beef."
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,3-Feb-13,"One of the best murtabak joints I've tried in Singapore. I can't believe they have so many fillings - beef, mutton, chicken and deer - to go with the murtabak. The murtabak pastry is just crisp and the meat is full of flavour. Best of all, the curry that they give to go with the murtabak is thick and not watered down like many other popular places. On a hot day I'd recommend you finish the murtabak with a sirap limau or bandung. Perfection!"
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",3,7-Apr-15,The food is nice and quite costly too and they don't take orders for prata only murtabak...
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",5,18-Dec-13,Chicken buryani..... Don't let the simple looks deceive you..... Flavors are out of this world
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",1,15-Jul-17,food is alright and the service is bad. some of the waiters are rude. wouldn't visit the place ever again.
Zam Zam Restaurant,4,99,"Indian, Halal",4,8-Mar-14,"the chicken murtabak was nicely done - the dough wrap was thin, and fillings with garnishes of the right proportions. eating it with the mild curry made for a delightful experience. the briyani we ordered had the mutton curiously hidden within the basmati rice and the serving was large yet lightly flavourful. i personally felt the rice could have been more fragrant. the chilli chicken curry was thick but not too spicy. the meat could have soaked more of the curry taste and overall it was just okay. doused the curry dishes with servings of sweet (but not too sweet) teh chino. the bill came up to 21 bucks for 2. would recommend this for one heavy supper!"
Empress,4.4,12,"Chinese, Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,6-Jun-23,"Hats off to the chef. Great inventive cooking beyond my imagination, delicious and delicate and detailed. Beautiful presentation. Worth every penny. And great scenery by the Singapore River. Love."
Empress,4.4,12,"Chinese, Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,1-Jan-23,"Creative twist to regional cuisine with great food, great views, and ambiance. Unlike the opposite side of the river where it's hustle & bustle with sometimes questionable food, this place is solid. The food is definitely five stars, the ambiance is easy-going...tucked next to The Asian Civilization Museum.  The prices keep away the grungy Euro or American backpacker/ fake influencer crowd. The river-side seating under a canopy provides for a casual experience while the interior banquet rooms are for more formal dining. Either way, the food is very, very good and delicious!! Service is perfectly timed and courses are well spaced-out.  Why not five stars? While service was courteous & efficient, the staff seemed disinterested and dour. Also, given the high prices, they still want to nickel & dime...2 SGD for a tiny dipping-sauce amount of Achar? That's crazy ...they should be giving away a whole plate of that with the meal! Should customers just take their own that they can purchase a large jar at NTUC for the same price? Yes, it's a small gripe, but it just slightly sours the experience which was overall wonderful.  I strongly recommend this place for the great food and the nice quiet ambiance in a densely populated hustle & bustle City. Then, afterwards, enjoy a nice, evening stroll along the river with delightful City views."
Empress,4.4,12,"Chinese, Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,1-Dec-20,"Located inside the Asian civilization museum, this modern chinese restaurant has both indoor and outdoor seating. There was a wedding going on when we went so we were seated outdoors with views of the Singapore river and boat quay. They have a great happy hour booze menu which is a plus. Food is great as well, plus they have tons of vegetarian options which is a rarity usually in chinese restaurants. We really enjoyed the pork and chives dumplings, impossible gyoza and the kung pao sesame chicken."
Empress,4.4,12,"Chinese, Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,16-Jan-20,There is no shortage of good food in Singapore. Between the restaurants and hawker stations the city knows how to eat. For my last night in the city my partner and I wanted to do something a little more upscale and nice with a pretty view and Empress did not disappoint. Beautiful decor and great service. We were staying at the Conrad in Suntec city and it was about a 15 minute pleasant walk.  Set along the river Empress has both inside and outdoor seating areas that are tastefully decorated. The outdoor area commands a nice view of the strip of bars and restaurants across the river. It's also great to watch to watch the boats pass. Large menu with a variety of choices. Service was on point as well. We started with some appetizers; the meatless meatballs and I ordered the prawn wonton soup. Both were great though the wonton soup only had one large wonton. Our main dishes were beef with peppercorn and kung pao chicken. Both were great at as well and my kung pao certainly had a kick and a lot of chilis. Dessert was good as well I really enjoyed the pandan creme br?l¨¦e (also got the matcha dessert but realllyyyy like the creme br?l¨¦e.
Empress,4.4,12,"Chinese, Asian Fusion, Singaporean",3,4-May-19,- 3.5 stars. Modern Chinese / dim sum place. Came here for the weekend dim sum brunch. Food was consistent across the board. Everything tastes ok though not amazing and variety was a bit limited / uninspiring i.e. nothing too different / memorable - Pretty good value for money though - the ala carte buffet was extremely filling. - Was a bit below expectation and would rather go to other nice weekend dim sum brunch rather than this one
Empress,4.4,12,"Chinese, Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,2-Jan-20,This place is an absolute gem! My Fianc¨¦ and I came here on vacation because we were craving Peking Duck. This place has amazing Vibes!! Situation on the water with an open terrace. Great mood lighting. Great music. Great Vibe.  Our Server was awesome!   Let's see what's good here!  We ordered:  Whole Peking Duck - Amazing! This is one of their signature dishes. Has the crepe pancake with it. They give you the entire Duck!  Sweet and Sour Pork - so good!  Kung Pao sesame Chicken - Good  Roast Chaw - Great!  House Fried Rice - Great!  Beef Chow Fun - Amazing!  Sweet Shrimp Rolls - Great  Broccoli I Salad - Fire  Overall this place is amazing! Definitely give this place a try!! You won't regret it
Empress,4.4,12,"Chinese, Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,16-Jan-16,"Excellent quality pricy dishes beautiful views  It opened only for a month but the crowd on a Saturday is quite surprising, not busy but buzzing. Causually dressed in a business district, and quiet conversations happens in the background.  The views of the river and skyline across is mesmerising. At 6.30pm we get some orange tinge across the cityscape. Nice. Probably more romantic then it was.  The food is just as excellent. Dim sum and cantonese dishes in upclass setting by the river. Tri platter roast tops our expectation while the sweet sour soup was delicious, right amount of spicy and sour for Asian palate. The stir fried pork cooked right with texture soft and chewy. We like the mushrooms too. The scallop on asparagus is lightly fried and the sweetness comes thru with the first bite. Our lobster noodles came last to fill the stomach and it taste as good as it looks. Eating the lobster requires is a handful but the tender noodles is a bit bland considering all the flavourful dishes upfront.  On the whole the experience is very pleasant though pricy. Will return for special occasions."
Empress,4.4,12,"Chinese, Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,2-Nov-18,"I chose this restaurant because I saw they have asian vegan dishes, and they delivered. The appetizers were unique and tasty. For the main dish, they offered a mapo tofu version that uses omnipork vegan pork substitute that was really tasty."
Empress,4.4,12,"Chinese, Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,14-May-17,Decent food and drinks with a nice view along the river. Reasonably priced especially in comparison to its nearby competitors.
Empress,4.4,12,"Chinese, Asian Fusion, Singaporean",4,22-Feb-18,"We went to a large corporate dinner, so we didn't choose what we ate, but dishes ranged from above average to very good. The main assets of the place are the superb view of Boat Quay, and the excellent service from a friendly and efficient team."
Empress,4.4,12,"Chinese, Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,28-May-16,"Been here twice for dim sums in the weekends, and both times I have been impressed by everything! The good is good, the service is attentive, the venue and location are great, and all of this for half of the price of brunch at any PS Cafes! :-)  Will continue to come back here!"
Empress,4.4,12,"Chinese, Asian Fusion, Singaporean",5,19-Oct-19,"Great food, amazing river view to boat quay. Adjoining museum it's the quiet part of town and you can look at the bustle of the quay and the serenity of the waterway as boat float past."
Enchanted Cafe,4.7,3,Cafes,4,2-Apr-18,"It's amazing that this cafe was around for a year and I have not been here! Probably it was over-shadowed by Old Hen next door? ;)  Beautiful dried flowers surround the cafe and it looked as if you've indeed stepped into an enchanted forest. Not to worry, there's not too much green that it might be scary for those with sensitive noses, like me. The wooden chairs/tables (though not all consistent in type) complemented the plants/dried flowers very well. My favourite, was the wall of oddities right next to the main door - you wouldn't even know that they were selling wrapped novels from The Novel Encounter (see pictures).  Anyway, we were partly enticed by the promotion that the cafe is having now, that's why we headed there - Order a burger and get a specialty coffee for $1(Promotion valid til 13 April!)  Verdict: * Ngoh Hiang Burger (with extra side of scrambled eggs as recommended by the lady boss) - The patty was juicy but I felt it was a tad small (I love patties, so the bigger the better!). The cold potato salad was heavenly; not sure what spices or herbs they used but I love the herb-y taste. The buns themselves were not too big but were nicely crisp on the outside. Overall, quite a creative dish.  * Truffle fries - This didn't make it to my Top 5 list but the truffle smell did last longer and tasted better then average. A good snack to order should you decide to sit for a while longer and chat.  * Mocha - If you're a Mocha fan, you've got to try this. The balance of coffee, milk and chocolate is perfect! After sipping many a Mocha in Norway and Iceland, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the first cup of Mocha I tasted in Singapore seems to be on par with what I had there.  * Latte - Another perfect cup.  Also, the theme of flowers/trees/magic lives on in the washroom. Look in the mirror and you might find a very thought-provoking quote - kinda reminds me of Snow White.  p.s I like my coffee not so milky or bitter so if you have similar taste as me, you might like my recommendations."
Enchanted Cafe,4.7,3,Cafes,5,29-Apr-18,A cute little cafe tucked around Little India..you will easily miss this place if you are not attentive..the interior decor is simply amazing and you will feel you are in a Harry Potter set..the name of the drinks are also very interesting - definitely try the Elixirs potion! We tried the creamy carbonara with mushroom and it was delicious. The choco nana tella toast with the caramelized banana was also pretty good..
Enchanted Cafe,4.7,3,Cafes,5,30-Apr-18,"The Enchanted cafe is situated in Little India. It's such a cute decor setting cafe - perfect to their name! I had made a Sunday brunch reservation through their FB page & so getting a seat was not a problem. The cafe is small but the decor & vibe will totally make you feel like In the sets of Harry Potter. The server was very sweet & friendly! This was my first visit & I wanted to try their famous Elixir drink- it was just perfect summer drink, very relaxing & the effects of dry ice gave it a real magical potion feel!! We loved the Creamy Carbonara & Choco-nana-tella toast. The food is presented very well & everything tasted so good!! The prices seemed fair & reasonable. The restaurant is going to relaunch after a week with new menu & look! Although I am sad that their Elixir drink won't be included.. I am excited to return to see the new look & try their new menu! This is definitely one of my fav cafes so far.. Can't wait to return."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,2-Jul-22,"A friend who used to live here recommended it, so I had to stop by. I ordered the iced sweet peach (Georgia) tea & the shrimp mango quesadilla. While pretty good sweet tea, I'm not sure if it's quite at Georgia standards yet! A fair amount of shrimp in the quesadilla, mixed with cheese and a slice of avocado and the fruit salsa dabbed on top with a drizzle of crema. They could use a little more toppings outside the quesadilla, whether it be more fruit salsa or another in the mix. You get free ""chips"" but more like giant hard tortilla shells and two types of salsa before your meal - hot and not as hot (green). Worth a stop if you're doing a tour through south east Asia and have a craving for Mexican food."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,3,2-Sep-22,"The food was great, I highly recommend the jalape?o spring rolls and the kimchi carnitas fries. The cucumber margarita was very refreshing as well. The reason I'm giving it three stars is because the service wasn't up to par. There was a party that arrived after us and they were tended to first. We had to go get a hold of the waiter to take our orders. I asked for more water and we never ended up getting a refill on water. Asked for the bill and we tried telling the waitress to split the bill and she just walked off in a hurry. Great food but need better customer service."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,25-Jun-18,"This place is stashed away in the dip but conveniently located in the Beach Road complex which is a Beautiful creation and area to stay and play in. We were greeted promptly and seated promptly. The menu was easy to read and the space is great as well as the music and shall I say the entertainment which I deemed as entertaining by way of the chef cooking and dancing to ""Despasito"" he had tons of rhythm.  Once I dig into the menu I was so excited to see that they had Vegan options. My Vegan tacos were super yummy, my husband had shrimp and chicken tacos which he loved. Our son had cheese quesadilla and he ate it all. My sister in law had shrimp tacos with pico on the side. She enjoyed, we all were very fond of the House chip and dip as it was fresh and the red sauce was super flavorful and my favorite of the two provided as we received a green sauce as well that our toddler liked since it was not as spicy.  This place is a must do when in Singapore especially if you are a VIP member of my travel club as we earn travel upon paying our tab. WIN WIN WIN"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,7-Mar-18,"Vatos Urban Tacos knows exactly what they are doing when it comes to authentic Mexican tacos!  I gotta say that I was a little hesitant to go for tacos in Singapore. I mean, if I sometimes can't find good tacos in the USA, which is just north of the border from Mexico. How was I going to find real tacos in Singapore? ...But I was WRONG!  Obviously not all of their menu is authentic Mexican; they do have a lot of tacos and dishes which are a fusion of Mexican with Korean and other styles. To keep it traditional, we order the Tacos de Carne Asada and to try something new had the Tacos de Pollo con Kimchi. The carne asada tacos were legit!!!! The meat was so tender and flavorful, the red salsa was spicy and delicious, and the tortilla was made to perfection. The carne asada tacos definitely made me think about my hometown of Ciudad Juarez in Mexico. The Kimchi Chicken tacos, were also really good and fresh, but I gotta say they were a little too oily for my taste, and could barely taste the chicken. It was definitely something I had never tried before and I actually kind of like it.  Also, we were here on a Tuesday and they had a deal of 3 tacos for the price of 2 (#WINNING)."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,14-May-19,"Well, Yelp never lets me down. Came to Vatos for dinner after needing a break from hawker stalls so I browsed Yelp and that's where we ended up.  My bf and I shared 3 orders of two tacos each- the beef brisket, pork belly, and fish tacos. They were all very delicious and although the taco tortilla appeared small, they were stacked to the sky with protein. It's not a very traditional Mexican place- because those places usually do two tortillas per taco, but I enjoyed these tacos thoroughly and I would come back if I ever visited Singapore again!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,12-Dec-17,"The place was having Korean-Mexican-Filipino Thanksgiving party with Iskina Cebu. The place was packed but lucky I had made a reservation in advance. We were showed to a high chair table by side. The place was quite noisy with tables spread to the walkway as outside was raining.  Chimichurri Lechon Tacos (S$15++/ 2 pieces) Handmade tortilla, ssamjang aioli, Iskinu Cebu lechon, chimichurri salsa. The serving was quite small. It was quite messy to handle the tacos. The flavours were yummy.  Jalape?o Pork Belly Lechon Tacos (S$15++/ 2 pieces) Handmade tortilla, ssamjang aioli, Iskinu Cebu pork belly lechon, pickled onions, jalape?os relish. The serving was quite small. It was quite messy to handle the tacos. The flavours were yummy.  I'm Rick James, Peach! (S$30++) Frozen Peach margarita + Tecate Beer The margarita was served in a glass with the beer bottle upside down. It was not too sweet. Oh man I was red like a peach after having the drink.  Didn't get to try the roasted chicken which was also that night special item as it was sold out by the time we placed order."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,1,1-Dec-22,"Hands down, the worst nachos I've ever had. Mexican food in SG is not usually great but this was a plate of stale chips with some sort of fake cheese sauce and yesterday's cold pork. Virtually inedible but was expensive. Is it so hard to use real cheese? Is that too much to ask for $30?"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,18-Mar-16,"Reservations highly suggested. We came on a random Tuesday night and this place was packed. Since we came all this way, we did not want to improvise so we said we would order for ""take-away"". Luckily a table opened up during our wait because the expected wait time is between 30 minutes to 2 hours.  Judging from the crowd, anticipation filled our hungry souls. The menu isn't extensive but enough to make you ponder about what to order. We looked at the menu for a good 10 minutes before we decided on what to order.  Dinner- all of us got the Fat Bastard burrito bowl. This was our favorite thing here. My colleagues and I couldn't stop raving about it. The rice, the sour cream, the beans, the carne asada was beautifully and deliciously executed. The kimchi fries were pretty good; the kimchi had a kick and I loved the jalape?os. The fries seemed to come out of a bag though...  The galbi no rice burrito I had the following day for lunch was packed. The galbi was tender and let's just say that it was too good to eat just half of it. I loved how tender yet firm the black beans are. The sauces that it came w/ only elevated the overall taste. No sauce needed.  Craving a burrito bowl now!!!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,14-Feb-19,"Who knew I would be drinking a beer from Northern California Brewery eating Asian/Mexican fusion food in Singapore? I thought it was awesome they had Lost Coast Brewery's stout as a beer option here. If I'm going to pay Singapore prices for alcohol, might as well be a craft beer, right? The Korean Po'boy was pretty filling. Loved the house chips here. Pretty huge but with the green was bomb."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,20-Jun-18,"Good for Americans who need a taste of home while on vacation. The service was good and the food was better. The menu needs to state all ingredients. We had a vegan with us who requested the vegetable burrito bowl and asked for the crema to be left off. It does not say there is cheese on it, but it came with cheese. When we explained the person was vegan, they immediately fixed it. They were apologetic and fixed it with no issues. Their nachos are some of the best!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,13-Jan-16,"So where do I begin? Opened about a month ago, Vatos is definitely a cool spot to grab a bite and/or drinks. The margarita drinks look crazy with the inverted bottle of beer/cider plunged into the frozen margarita glass. As for the food, for me it's not something new and exciting. Roy Choi started the whole Korean taco theme in Los Angeles circa 2008, and it's been duplicated around the world. I'm still looking for ""the"" place in SG that serves up the Tex-Mex/Cali-Mex versions that my palate is familiar with. Don't get me wrong, Vatos is a great choice for asian-influenced Mexican street food.  The tacos were, how do I put it? ... tasty but unsubstantial. Maybe I'm jaded by being from California, but ~$12++ for a couple of tacos is kinda pricey. The homemade tortillas were good but a little thin. The flavors were a mash-up of Mexican and Korean, which I enjoyed. The Kimchi carnitas fries were a bit salty. Don't know if the fries were salted, hopefully not, because the kimchi, cheese, and carnitas were already sodium loaded.  Would come back again because there are things on the menu I still want to try. Mucho gusto."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,3,4-Nov-17,"Traveling alone on business with a free day in Singapore. After visiting the national museum I decided to stop here for lunch. Street tacos are pretty common back in the US, and this looked intriguing. I will admit, the bar is pretty high given the quality of this type of food back home but I thought I'd give it a shot.  While I really wanted this to be good, there were several negatives the first of which is they only will serve a two taco minimum. So if you're a party of one and you want to sample three different tacos, you're out of luck. It's only 3 of one type or 4 of two types, etc No big deal if you're dining with friends, but cut me some slack. I'm a party of one who really wanted to sample your food and you wouldn't do it even with a polite request to make an exception.  So I ordered 3 pork barbecoa and they were delicious. So delicious, I was wishing I could have tried some others. The ""Cowboy Queso"" on the other hand was so bland and tasteless it's as if someone just melted some plain cheese in a bowl. So we're batting 50 50 on food quality.  Then there's the service. Kind of disinterested and bothered would he how I would describe it. Ordered a beer and a water with my meal and the water never showed. My server never showed again either and I had to all but stand up and wave my arms when it was time to go.  It's a pretty nice place and the one taco I tried was delicious, but beyond that, there's not much to recommend here and given the negatives, I'm not sure I would come back. So much excellent food in Singapore, so lots of other options."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,3,13-Nov-16,"Good atmosphere and service (especially by Singapore standards) but the food was just ok. I'll go back to try more items as the kimchi fries looked awesome.  Galbi tacos - enjoyed these the most Spicy chicken quesadilla - pro ably wouldn't order again, seemed to have been cooked in a lot of oil or butter."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,16-Jun-17,"So far so good. Happy hour is 12-7pm and for $30++ you can have kimchi carnitas fries and two beers. a good deal. good fries. good beer. will be back for the rest.  Update! I have been back and it is still good. Tacos - the korean inspired ones were better than the mexican inspired ones, in my opinion.  Finally - do you love raw onions? I mean, really really love them? Do you want to have an onion party in your mouth long after your meal is over? Then Vatos is the place for you! Run, don't walk.  Make reservations, it's popular. Vatos is located in the old building part of South Beach, right next to Shaw Tower and facing Beach Road."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,1-Jun-17,So far so good. Happy hour is 12-7pm and for $30++ you can have kimchi carnitas fries and two beers. a good deal. good fries. good beer. will be back for the rest.  ps. it's on street level facing Beach Road.
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,1,22-Jun-17,"Not really sure what all the fuss is about. The food is horrible, drinks are non-local and overpriced, restaurant is dirty and they need more staff...  Location is great, in South Beach area. Maybe that's the draw.  From Austin and I know the Korean Mexican style cooking that is all the rage in Austin and SoCal, but these guys missed the mark.  Kimchi Fries which is their main dish was inedible. The jalape?o barbacoa spring rolls were unique, but not too bad - thus the one star.  When you pay, they take your credit card and then disappear for almost 20 min. I'll have to pay attention to charges now. One star for the spring rolls, zero stars for service, food and drinks."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,31-Dec-18,"As a California native I can assure you the food is on point. While visiting Singapore with my family, we visited Vatos on a whim (Mexican food in Southeast Asia?!?). It was incredible! The guacamole and OG margarita were excellent. No bottled mix here, just tons of fresh lime juice. The Korean fusion elevates traditional Mexican dishes to a whole new level. You have got to try the Kimchi carnitas fries, they are out of this world! The Fat Bastard burrito bowl lives up to it's name, it is ginormous (but very tasty). Loved the addition of a crispy cheese layer to the quesadilla. A note to another reviewer,freshly made corn tortillas are supposed to be thin. I'm sorry we were too full for dessert. The place was busy (and as others have noted loud), but the service was good. Overall I would highly recommend."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,2,8-Jan-19,"The food was average, the staff were lacklustre and I left thinking the place was run like it did not matter that you've paid a fair bit for a good night out. Worse of all, no one else seemed to care that they were paying high prices for really average food and service. Not a good investment in a night out.  Compared to Mexican restaurants in LA or Vegas, this was pale in comparison."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,17-May-16,Vatos offers delicious Mexican/Korean fusion food for a city deprived of quality Mexican food choices. I came by here on a weekday evening and was very satisfied with the food.  Among the items I tried: - Kimchi carnitas fries: Highly recommend. Generous portion and flavorful taste. - Spicy chicken quesadillas: Great texture crispy on the outside. Inside was good but not as phenomenal as the kimchi fries - Pork urban tacos: Generous portion of meat served on tiny soft tortillas. Would be great if Vatos increased the tortilla sizes to help customers feel like they were getting what they paid for  Overall great food in a casual fun ambiance. Would go back again if I could successfully secure a reservation like I did this time around.
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,1-Nov-18,"First things first: don't be alarmed when your party's food does not arrive at the same time. The plates are delivered as they come out of the kitchen. You'll see this throughout Singapore.  Vatos Tacos is a delightful Mexican/Korean fusion that offers a break from the oodles of noodles (sorry, couldn't help myself) and rice you'll consume whilst in Singapore. ""Chips"" (more accurately, tortillas) and salsa are complimentary with your visit.  What I Got and What I Thought: 1. Chimichurri Chicken Urban Taco DELICIOUS. Would absolutely have this again. The chimichurri was perfectly tangy and a great complement to the ""spicy"" chicken. While it did have a nice kick to it, I finished the tacos without a tingling sensation on my lips. As long as you can handle a couple of chilies you will be golden. If you're interested in a dish that has the fire emblem next to it, but you're worried about spice, just ask the waitstaff what you need to prepare for.  2. Honey Tequila Chicken Wings Best part of the meal and a great option to share with the table. As you could surmise from the name of the dish, the wings are sweeeeeeeeeeet, but they do come covered in slices of chilies. The heat-fearing members of my party were able to fully enjoy the wings by removing the chilies (this is a simple task).  Vegan and vegetarian options are available!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,17-Mar-16,"This place was a great discovery.  A friend and I went on a Saturday afternoon for a quick lunch and we were pleased. He had the 3 Korean Pork Belly Tacos and I had the 3 Barbacoa Shredded Pork Tacos. We swapped a taco (as a taste test) and both agreed that the Pork Barbacoa was much better than the Korean. The chunky pork belly in the Korean taco was not as good as the shredded pork of the Barbacoa.  The Good: Plain and simple. Really good food!  The Bad: The stools aren't comfortable. The corn tortillas were a little on the small and thin side. (Singapore has soft corn tortilla issues and only few places produce these with good results). For the price, they should serve salsa with the chips & guacamole. The guac was a little flavourless.  The Verdict: Two big thumbs up. Really looking forward to returning to try the Kimchi fries and other menu items. I hear that evenings are crowded so make a reservation."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,30-Nov-15,"Vatos is freaking amazing! I'm not saying this bc I love Korean food, nor am I saying this bc I love Mexican food...I'm saying this bc the food is just that good! And when you combine those two cuisine? Wow. Speechless.  The MUST eats include: * Kimchi fries - sounds funny, but imagine savory fries with an extra spicy cake from the kimchi. The kimchi did not appear to be aged for too long so no sourness here. Just a bit of tart and an extra kick of spicy. * Shrimp tacos - loved this! Though I'm not sure if the tortillas were made from flour or corn. Perhaps a combination of the two? I prefer corn but the prawns were so large and juicy that all is forgiven * Quesadillas - my gf loved this dish so much that she ordered it twice. Both for herself. * California Salad - got give some love to my home state and the salad is pretty great. Win-win all around (especially when you start thinking of about the carbs + fat + cheese + calories on the menu).   The MUST drinks include: * Vatos magaritas, aka, a large magarita with a bottle of beer popped in -try ""Grow a Pear"" or ""Sexy Sanchez."" (Please don't Google the latter until you've tried the drink.) * Texas Tea - This thing was HUGE! Not a surprise as it includes 6 kinds of liquors. I usually finish my cocktails in about 30 minutes, but this baby lasted me the whole night so it's worth that hefty price tag.  I also tried the Mexican Martini but it was too sweet for me. This came as a surprise since it was a martini and I'm a lady. Perhaps those with a sweet(er) tooth would enjoy the Mexican Martini more.  The atmosphere is great...almost like stepping into a TexMex steak house. I also love the concept of an open kitchen. The open bar helped as well. Seating-wise, be prepared for stools and no place to hang those handbags. My lady friends and those with bad posture/backs/necks, you have been warned. Oh yea, the bathroom is located upstairs so you'll need to walk outside of the restaurant, hop into an elevator, and go through a club before you can reach your destination.  Vatos will definitely make a mark in the Singapore food scene, especially since Korean + Mexican fusion has yet to be witnessed and tasted by most locals and many expats. Coming from California, this fusion isn't something new (heard of bulgogi tacos anyone? Soooooo 2003.), and would satisfy the cravings of old timers like myself. Can't wait to return and make Vatos a daily stable in my diet.  Psssst...Vatos is located below Vanity. Eat here before drinking and partying."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,3,20-Feb-16,"What a cool looking place with a faux industrial look. It's a fusion Korean mex place which I guess means you just add kimchi to everything. Most things have a little spicy kick. The vatos burrito with kalbi(can choose different meats) was ok. Not great but ok. Kalbi, kimchi, fries etc sounds like it should be good but actually it's a bit too solid a food when compacted together. I want something more balanced. The kimchi fries were nice which is fries, meat, kimchi and cheese. Sounds similar ingredients to the vatos burrito but it's just better in that form. Looks like there are fun drinks here too. I would come back to try some other things."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,12-May-20,Greta place to come chill but now can only takeaway. Can try it out if you are keen in Mexican food especially their beef taco. Can't wait to go back again after ccircuit breaker
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,6-May-16,"I am a Mexican food lover. I am not a Korean food lover. I am an original cuisine lover. I am not crazy over fusion and its blings and gimmicks. I am a simple man with simple love for simple excellent food.  I see the great reviews therefore I decide to try this place since I have never had any Mexican food in Singapore before. So I came here to try if the fusion between Korean and Mexican could be something that I love.  I was overwhelmed by the choices of food on the menu actually. It comes to starter (nachos usually and chicken wings?), tacos, quesadillas, burritos (that I note none of the reviewers have tried?), drinks. Usually in great authentic mexican restaurant, you will know whether you want tongue, shoulders, chicken, fish, etc for each. Here there are many to choose with its description of the sauce and everything.  Food 3.5/5 I opted for the barbacoa pork shoulder taco with vatos special sauce and yes they are pretty spicy. The taco is not using usual tortilla but something stronger to hold all the leaking meats on the taco, yes it is gonna get messy. Pork is tender, sauce is good, portion is generous, so great value for the money: 11$ for 2 tacos.  I also ordered the pork kimchi quesadillas since it seems to be one of their main item and I note many of reviewers really love their kimchi fries. The quesadillas is not using tortilla, instead using the same ingredients of flour that make a Korean kimchi pancake. It is pretty crisp, cheese inside is melting, but pork flavor is overpowered by the sauce and everything else. It is quite pricey for 18$.  Again I am more into a simple food that could bring forth the original ingredients' taste and texture. In vatos, it is being a fusion restaurant, the main attraction is the sauce at the end, even though yes, the meat is tender. But I believe that it is being prepped and cooked with care and love by the team :) it is not what I will definitely get to visit when I have the chance.  Btw drinks is quite pricey and they don't seem to offer any happy hour.  Service 4.5/5 Venue 5/5 Great place to hang out since it is cozy and comfortable.  Overall 3.5/5 :) it is a great place for anyone looking for something new and a fan of fusion food. All reviews are based on my taste for original Mexican food in San Diego and Jakarta/Bali with its Taco Local."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,18-Dec-15,"Loved it! Located right beside South Beach Hotel, tucked away in the pretty white building. You might just miss it if you don't look hard enough!  Despite not making a reservation we still managed to get a seat for 2 pretty much almost immediately! We ordered a Spicy Chicken Rice bowl and Prawn Taco (don't remember the exact name) and the Chips with guacemalo sauce ( i think thats the name )  Food was served pretty fast and food was on point! Noms noms! Definitely coming back for more to try out the other dishes. It was definitely a busy night but service was still really good!  So long for now..till next time!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,3,16-Feb-16,"After checking into my hotel, checked out Yelp to see what restaurants in the area may be appealing. When I saw a Mexican Korean fusion place with good ratings, had to go try it out.  There were many reviews about the special, the Korean Kimchi fries but didn't try them out. Had 2 of the Korean pork bbq tacos instead. The tacos had a nice touch of sliced dikon/radish with good pickled flavors. The pieces of pork bbq were decent, though sliced a bit different than I normally see. They were more chunks of pork rather than slices of Korean Pork that you normally see. The Mexican flavoring was on the light side. Would've liked to see more salsa and spice to the dish. The salsa in the tacos was underwhelming.  The chips that they provided as an appetizer was a nice change. Instead of chips as small pieces it came out as 3 large pieces of chips that you broke into pieces. But it was a bit on the stale side, maybe came at the wrong time as it was 3 in the afternoon once I made it out here after checking into my hotel. The salsa tasted like back home with the green chile verde and regular hot red spicy sauces.  They did have nice craft beers though, didn't know they had these types of beers in Singapore. The place has a happy hour, or late night drinking and tacos or fries type of feel to it. Will have to come back with some colleagues for some food and drinks.  Once I try the Korean Kimchi fries and some more drinks the rating may improve."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,29-Dec-15,"yep this place is legit. Not easy to see from the street, look for the South Beach Tower - the restaurant is tucked into the white alcoved building on the Beach Road side.  I was seated at the bar right away, visiting right when they open at noon on a Tuesday. Immediately greeted by the bartender offering a nice selection of draft beers: curiously all American micros like Left Coast, Modern Times, and Stone.  I was perusing the menu for only a minute before another staff member came by, asked if it's my first time, and made food recommendations. I ordered the prawn and pork belly tacos (2 each). Right away chips (which are three giant tortilla chips) were served with both green and red salsa, which were both very tasty with a bit of spice.  The food came quickly and was presented simply: two tacos each on two small plates.  The pork belly tacos are served with red and white onions, and are a bit sweet and very tender. Very nice.  The prawn taco is similar to a fish taco you would get in San Diego, with cole slaw and salsa. The prawns are lightly fried.  Tacos are $5-6 each, minimum two per kind per order and come on light tortillas. 4 tacos with the chips and salsa and a beer was plenty of food for me.  Overall a five-star experience all around, from the service to the food to the ambience. Definitely check it out if you're craving tacos in Singapore."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,16-Nov-18,"First night in Singapore and fou d this hidden gem. It needs to be on your must try list!! Chimichuri street tacos with enough heat to numb your lips but filled with so much flavor, you won't stop eating!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,18-Feb-18,"(Archived draft from 17/1/2016, I realized I forgot to hit ""Post"", but here it is, the 2018 edited version)  Southern California style Korean-Mexican food!  I never thought I'd see this food combination here in Singapore, but here it is. This place really reminded me of the K-Mex type places in SoCal, especially Los Angeles.  The ingredients are tasty and fresh, and the corn tortillas are rolled fresh in the kitchen. I usually get the kalbi short rib, korean pork belly and baja fish tacos, and the kimchi carnitas fries. It's that interesting spicy fusion cuisine that brings back memories of LA. (And its my choice of comfort food)  Food and service standards have since dropped a bit since opening in 2016, but I have since been back regularly to satisfy my taco cravings.  Vatos is a chain from Seoul, started by three former Korean-American California residents. One of the restaurant's founders Sid Kim was actually doing the serving and checking on the tables the night i visited in Jan 2016 when they had just opened for business. They have since expanded to another location in the West of the island, at Timbre+ in Buona Vista.  Don't come in here expecting the authentic deal Mexican food and you'll be okay. (Which is best left to the experts at another restaurant.)  5-stars in 2016, but has since fallen to 4-stars in 2018. Stars are relative to the quality of ""Mexican"" food you can find in Singapore."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,23-Oct-17,"After enjoying my meal, I took a peek into their kitchen to see if they had Mexicans preparing food - that's how good it was. I recently moved to Singapore (born and raised in NYC), and this was the first time I felt like I was back in the states: eating delicious tacos while drinking pints from Colorado.  Things you must order: Kimchi Carnitas Fries Galbi Short Rib Tacos Baja Fish Tacos  The moment I realized my fries were crispy and fresh under a blanket of carnitas and kimchi, I knew this place was legit. Very happy to have found a place that can remind me of home."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,22-Apr-16,"Amazing food (if you like hot and spicy). Best tamales I had in a while, the chimichurri chicken tacos are even better (yes, chimichurri sauce on chicken...). Def five stars for food!  The drinks though ...have a beer (...unless you like expensive, light margarita mix without any alcohol)! :-)"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,2-Jan-16,"I will join everyone else in the praise of this place. They are located in a nice looking white building on South Brach Road. We had no reservations but they still managed to find seats for us. Service was in general great, they were attentive and also served us some complimentary snacks when we had to wait a bit (actually not very long) for our food.  The a bit unusual combo of Mexican and Korean really works well. They serve a variety of different tacos, burritos, enchiladas as well as some other larger dishes.  The tacos I sampled were all great but the Galbi Short ribs and the Barbacoa Pork where in a league of their own. If you like spicy do also try the chimichurri chicken. To make things even better they have a great beer selection and the cocktails looked interesting and not the mention huge. Will come again!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,1,15-Feb-17,"Imagine the smallest American town you can. Maybe a place where ""Make America Great"" signs are fading in front of every other mobile home.  Next, visualize the worst American-style Mexican you ever ate there. Maybe it was a place called Panchos. Maybe it was Senor Pedros. Who knows, it was bad. Maybe you went in, got some refried beans from a can with some instant rice, some tasteless generic salsa, a burrito that was 95% filler. And you remember being annoyed at wasting ten bucks.  Now, think of a restaurant that tastes literally two times worse, and costs $120 for two appetizers, three drinks, and one burrito. That would be the amazing restaurant that is Vatos in Singapore."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,26-Jan-16,Ok so this place was decent for being in Asia lol. I would've given them 3 starts for effort but they had Jarritos so I had to give them an extra star.  So here's my break down 3 stars for food. It was just "ok" in my opinion but to be fair I'm from the land of Mexican food and Korean street tacos.  4 stars for alcohol and beverage selection. The margaritas made me feel like I was back home. I will definitely be back for drinks and maybe some appetizers. I do wonder where they get their avocados from tho lol
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,26-Jul-17,"Finally made it for taco Tuesday!  Four of us ordered the happy hour kimchi carnitas fries and 4 types of tacos.  Kimchi carnitas fries - 3.5 stars Great dish to share but we all didn't remember there was kimchi till halfway through. Perhaps there wasn't much kimchi in it to begin with.  Galbi beef taco - 4 stars This was my favorite! We gathered that it was slightly sweet, so those who weren't fond of sweet mains picked the prawn one as their favorite.  Chili and lime prawn taco - 4 stars This was my second favorite - the prawns were fried well and still crisp, warm and flavorful when I had them.  Fish taco - 2.5 stars I don't know if it's because I had this after the prawn taco that by then it had gotten way too soggy and the breading was too thick and just tasted like oil. Granted there was a decent amount of fish in it.  Carne asada taco - 2 stars Too spicy for all of us! Not much flavor I remember.   $96 for 4 of us so that's a very decent $24 each. And I'm still full the morning after... does this make me 3-taco girl? D: not sure I'm dying to go back though. I guess I'd have to try their burritos. A bit noisy for dinner conversation and I'm getting to the age where I don't like yelling over the dinner table anymore..."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,2,19-Mar-18,"Sad to say, the standard of food at Vatos has dropped since 2016. I thought it was a one off, where maybe the chef on that day was new or having a bad day, but I gave it two more chances and was still disappointed with the tacos. The soft tacos tasted too floury and the fish batter too thick and oily. You dont taste the fish.  The only redeeming dish is the Honey Tequila Chicken Wings. Because of course you can't screw up chicken.  Won't be back again."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,21-Jun-16,"If you've ever wanted to know what wholesome felt like, getting the Barbacoa Pork tacos or burrito will give you that experience on your tastebuds. I don't know why I waited months before I tried Vatos out, but I eventually did and have been there five times since April. And thank goodness for uBereats, cos now we can get it delivered.(Just make sure you order before peak hours)  Highly recommend the Baja Fish tacos and Barbacoa Pork. Baja fish has a nice flavourful kick. The chipotle mayo, pico de gallo and apple coleslaw are best friends on this one and give Destiny's Child a run for their money. (Yes, its backdated but you get the point). I usually get 3 taco servings; 2 to be happy with and the third for incase your friend wants to try it or you can be selfish.  Barbacoa pork in either taco or burrito form, depends on how hungry you are. We chose to ""Create your own burrito"" and went with the Fajita style. Like I said in the first paragraph, the taste here is wholesome. The sweet and spiciness of the pork merging with the carnival of ingredients on this one is a taste to remember and very fulfilling.  Tried the Honey Tequila Chicken Wings. If you like your Korean chicken wings, try this as the honey tequila marinade is thick, sweet and tangy and the blue cheese sauce for dipping adds another level of flavour to familiarity. Good for sharing.  Complimentary fresh chips and salsa is a plus, save the leftover sauces for your other dishes.  Oh and get that Georgia sweet iced tea! It washes everything down nicely.  Definitely coming back again. and again.  Best to make dinner reservations 2-3 days in advance if you plan to go there on a weekend. It gets packed as hell. Service is friendly and good. I have no complaints there."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,1-Jul-19,Good food nice environment great selection almost to much to choose from. Only service was lacking a bit with plenty of staff they could have gotten us to order a few more margaritas had they only asked and never asked us we wanted desert by the time we got the bill we didn't.
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,27-Jun-19,Mexican food in Singapore? Yes absolutely Yes! If it's what your craving this is the place. Chips and salsa. Drinks and the food is good. Loved the salsa.
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,25-Jul-16,"Best tacos I've had in Singapore, even though it's Korean-Mex tacos. Thank you for doing your carnitas well (be it in tacos or in the kimchi fries)- tender, moist, and enough fatty bits. Yum. (I just wish they wouldn't put lettuce in the tacos though- it ain't korean nor mexican...)  Food comes out fast, and service is also consistently pleasant and prompt.  Oh, and for your appetizer, they serve you deep fried tortillas with two sauces. The red roasted onion chipotle sauce was really good, however the tomatillo salsa verde was a bit off (can't remember, it was too bitter or smoky. And I'm someone that actually normally loves salsa verde and dislikes smoky chipotle salsas.)  I wish they'd allow you to mix tacos (min order of 2 of the same kind), so you'd get to try more flavours. (2 is enough if you're sharing an appetiser) Ah well, guess I'm coming back again, which I really wouldn't mind."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,15-Aug-16,Korean/Mexican fusion with a delicious twist from the original roots in California. The Galbi tacos are delicious so are the "fried" quesadillas and the carne Asada burritos. The prices are reasonable for Mexican food in Singapore and the Lost Coast brewery craft beers (or the frozen margaritas) compliment the meal quite nicely. The only knock is that I ordered Vatos couple times through Uber Eats and both times comes cold and incorrect - think it is more of an Uber issue that Vatos. This place is awesome overall! Highly recommend
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,10-Dec-15,"First things first... This place has got queso! Not something that looks like queso but actual cheesy queso with jalape?os and its damn good! And tacos galore! Shrimp tacos, chicken tacos, all kinds of tacos! Sorry for all the exclamation points but this place is one for the books and I can't wait to come back! This Texas girl has a found her new favorite restaurant in Singapore!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,29-Apr-16,This just might be my new go-to when I'm craving sit-down Mexican. Granted the prices still aren't pretty (e.g. $17 for 3 tacos) but they still beat some other Mexican joints out there in Singapore and the level of fusion deliciousness is on-point.  I wholeheartedly (and full-stomach-edly) recommend the quesadillas! Both the spicy chicken and prawn ones combined Korean and Mexican flavors in surprising ways and were very yummy.  Extra points for the cool vibes (Vatos is secretly hidden away inside a nondescript white building). Can't wait to be back for dinner!
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,2,24-Jun-18,"Long story short. $30 for a margarita is insane. Go somewhere else for a drink. Only go on Taco Tuesday to get 3 tacos for the price of 2 at $12. Service could be improved greatly. I waited at least 15 mins to place my order. The barbacoa tacos were delicious, but I won't be back."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,1-Dec-16,"There's one outlet at timbre+ one north now. I had trouble deciding what to get as there were so many permutation and combinations. I really like quesadilla but the lady before me got some and it was like bright red! Looks so different from those at chipotle.  We ended up getting a burrito bowl and burrito. Considering that this is the low cost post-clubbing fare in the states, at 20 bucks this isn't cheap. They did serve nachos and salsa tho. On the bright side, the food here really quite good. The Korean pork was a little fatty but I pretty much polished it all up. Beans, rice and all. I'll get the quesadilla next time :)"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,29-Feb-16,"This place kicks ass.  Every single dish we ordered was on point:  1) Kimchi Fries - I've never had anything like it and it was so good. They even include a sweet sauce that balances the flavors completely. I can eat this alone all day long.  2) Short rib tacos - Really really good  3) Baja Fish Tacos - Another wow. I grew up loving Rubio's Fish Tacos in California and I actually like this one at Vatos much better. It's crispy enough and full of flavor.  4) Honey Tequila Chicken Wings - Really good but be careful, these are spicy!  5) Chips and Guacamole - Great guacamole.  They have your range of Lost Coast Brewery beers on tap.  Service is great and ambiance is very grungy and cool. Highly recommend to bring friends or a date for something different that will be more exciting than your usual dinners."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,1-Jul-17,"Was recommended this place by a friend. Excellent Mexican fusion food. The tacos, nachos and burger were excellent. Friendly and helpful staff. The drinks were good as well. Reasonable price considering the location but again, the food was excellent."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,1-Mar-16,Great place to chill out and have great food ! The fusion between korean and Mexican worked well - the food being more Mexican inspired with some korean twists. It's tough to find good Mexican food in singapore which is why this place is a gem.
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,11-Mar-17,Love this place would recommend the fish tacos and signature margarita. Ambiance is warm and energetic. Service was great
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,3,25-Nov-18,"This place has good tacos and guacamole. I got take out and they were very friendly. I'm a Texan living abroad so I get taco-lonely easy, and these ones set me right for a spell."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,2,7-Jun-16,"Service was insipid & food mediocre at best. We had the cheese quesadillas, Baja fish tacos, honey tequila wings, kimchi fries, a spicy chicken burrito bowl & a Nutella nachos amongst the 5 of us and nothing (well except for the non-existent service), stood out to us really. Place was badly ventilated, which the mobile coolers failed to help. It doesn't suck but when you're spoilt for choice in a place like S'pore, being mediocre doesn't you any favours."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,28-Sep-16,"I live in the outskirts of SG so stumbling on Vatos via UberEats was a happy occurrence.  I ordered two items that weren't exactly inexpensive for one person, but both were delicious enough to be worth the price.  The spicy chicken tacos were served with soft shell tortillas- messy and great tasting with fresh ingredients and tender chicken that came with two sauces. Albeit not very spicy but still pretty memorable.  The tequila wings were reminiscent of your typical fried Korean wings with a sweet and spicy kick balanced with the offering of blue cheese.  Enjoyable meal and my now new go to for Taco Tuesdays/everyday."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,7-Dec-15,I'll basically co-sign what Debbie wrote. Was a big fan of Vatos in Seoul and am glad to see the Mexican Korean fusion options growing in Singapore from zero to one.
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,13-Jun-16,"Absolutely love this place! The south beach is an architectural wonder itself - beautiful at night. Had the one in Itaewon, Seoul and wasn't disappointed by the ambience nor the food quality! Perfect place for a Friday night out.  The kimchi fries are a must try; we also had their galbi tacos and the kimchi pork quesadilla The quesadilla was done like a Korean pancake Very very nice - although these three dishes were a tad bit of carb overload for our party of two. Our small stomachs are to blame though!  The kor-mex fusion is done very nicely; almost bringing me back to LA / Itaewon  I wouldn't recommend seating outside though - i think that's where the kitchen ventilators get released , it smells too much of oil for my liking. Was pretty suffocating.  Another point! Do give their margaritas a try - can't miss that out! Looking forward to trying their other drinks the next time I'm there!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,2,17-Feb-19,"This place is just mediocre. The food isn't as flavorful as it should be, it's overpriced, and the service is poor."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,18-Apr-16,"We were not too far away, when I decided to open my app and see what was around me. The word Vatos just stood out. Growing in California and also being Hispanic, how could I not identify. I'm glad we did visit this place. I enjoyed the Tamales which were excellent and the accompanying sauces were fresh. We also ordered some pork rib tacos that were filled with loads of meat. Lastly, the drinks were large, made with excellent ingredients and tasty. They even had tequila from Corralejo. We even talked to the guy who runs the place and he is also a West Coast California native. Awesome guy! Keep it up and will definitely be back for this week."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,3,30-Jan-16,"OK guys. Mexican Korean Asian fusion restaurant. Rating 3 with a heavy heart because I think this place has potential but... Food quality is very good, meaning the ingredient, I'd say 4, but it isn't your traditional zesty, spicy and fresh Mexican food which they actually claim not to be a Mexican restaurant. When someone says tacos my mind goes to Mexico, spicy zesty fresh... You won't get it here.  If I want to be critical then this place lacks of food identity. If I want Mexican I won't come here, if I want Korean I won't come here, if in mood for Asian fusion same thing.  Staff very friendly, attentive, they do happy hours 12-7pm, 1 for 1 which I think will end once they establish themselves but great nevertheless... I miss ceviche on the menu.  Ambience is cool, hipstery and industrial...  Go try I would love to see your opinion."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,2,14-Jun-16,"So I really wanted this place to be something awesome. But... Ok so here it is. Beer cold. Salsas nice and fresh. Service is ok. Hip ambience. Location walkable from Bugis. Vegan options if you ask. Taco wrap? The suck. I mean, really thin fall apart messy up your sleeve crappy nothingness. Impossible to eat unless you go with a spoon! How about switching to crispy taco shells? Cmon!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,3-Jan-19,"Friendly place with lots of good options. I throughly enjoyed the Vatos style veggie burrito, definitely would say was worth every penny. Seems like a lot of the food there has their own twist to it. Definitely would recommend."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,3-Jun-16,"My family loves this place! The drinks are awesome and fairly priced (for Singapore). For the most part the food is really good. Try anything with pork and you'll be set up for taste bud happiness. Standouts (IMO) were the pork tacos, tamales, guacamole, chicken wings, and chili lime prawns. Even if it's mid week make sure to call for a reservation. So many places in Singapore seem to come and go as soon as they open so here's hoping that Vatos Urban Tacos stays around for a long while!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,21-Aug-16,"Well, truly what do you think the odds are of having tacos in Singapore?  If you thought ZERO, you are wrong. Thank goodness for Vatos Urban Tacos!  Although not a ""pure"" California street taco experience, there was a mix of more traditional and sorta Asian Fusion across the menu - really the namesake Kimchi Fries...  I found the salsas fantastic and the tacos quite good. What really made the experience, was a great selection of primarily California craft beers"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,3,16-Oct-16,"I've made reservations twice but failed to turn up for both times and last night I made an impromptu walk-in and lucky me; I was able to get seatings! They are always almost fully booked so making a reservation is highly encouraged. It is a vibrant place with a wide array of different ethnicities for customers.  Although I've read many negative reviews about the service in Vatos; mine was the complete opposite. The wait staff tagged to me was a casual Muslim dude with a bubbly personality, sincere and prompt! It made the whole experience even better!  Food was IMMACULATE! The best burritos in town for me. This diner is the perfect distinctness for ""koreanmexican"" fusion cuisine. If only the indoors weren't so deafening; it would be perfect.  Location: 4/5 Environment: 3/5 (indoors) -because of the music Environment: 4/5 (outdoors) Service: 4/5 Food: 5/5"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,3,18-May-16,"If you crave for some mixed meals of Mexican and Korean, Vatos will be where to go. Though the food was unlike the original in Korea, we still enjoyed the kimchi fries and their specialty dishes. Good enough to sooth down our longing for Korea since we moved 2 years ago.  The ambiance is more like a bar than a restaurant, with tall chairs and loud noise. The funny thing is it has a chic restroom with special touch-up section for ladies.  Will we come back? May be.. That will be once in a year coz there are many other better Korean restaurants around."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,8-Oct-18,Food was worth the price! I enjoy this place with my family members but they may be very busy during the weekends.
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,2,31-Jan-16,"Service needs improvement! Menu prices were labelled wrong, we were charged more for some items. After pointing it out, they didn't take any action. I personally don't see the fuss over their signature kimchi fries, they were served soggy and overall were underwhelming. The Kalbi beef and shrimp tacos were ok, don't go here expecting good/authentic Mexican food. Good to try though!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,16-Apr-17,"We got here about half an hour before the kitchen was to close so we were instructed to order quick. We got signature margaritas (about the cheapest you can find in Singapore for the size!), Vatos Cowboy Queso, and an assortment of tacos (fish, chicken, shrimp, asada). Everything was yummy and fresh-tasting. We lived in South Texas and thought this place was great. Service was fast and friendly. The decor is funky. Go!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,24-Apr-16,"Couldn't get reservation 4 days in advance. So do MAKE RESERVATIONS IN ADVANCE. I was informed though that if I walked in, there could be seats available in the outdoors.  Walked in at 6.30pm, outdoor seating was available. Chill, quiet atmosphere, quite different from the inside which seems quite lively yet cozy. However there is no shelter outdoor so fingers crossed that it does not rain! And just a minor detail, we found the stools outdoors a little uncomfortable.  Food was received extremely quickly. Serving seem small at first but was filling.  Recommend the fish tacos ($14 for 3) and the chicken chimi tacos($14 for 3)  We were put off by the price of the drinks but when they were served, we had no qualms about the price for they were ENORMOUS. One drink should last you the whole night, no worries. Sharable if you don't want to spend 30 bucks on drinks as it is again, huge.  Guacamole chips ($10) were underwhelming though, would have like it to have more lime and seasoning in it. More tortilla chips could have been served too, as I felt it was not worth the price for such a small serving. Next time, I would pass on the guac, which is a shame as every Mexican place should have great guac!  Overall a very pleasant experience (not a first date option as eating can get messy) and was impressed by the excellent service! Could turn to be one of my fav places in bugis for a quite yet casual chill night out."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,18-Jun-17,Great food and excellent margaritas. The staff was very friendly and food was very timely and delicious. The nachos was a great hit to start off with the drinks.
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,1,28-Dec-17,"Found this place here on Yelp. They really need to update their information given the number of visitors/travelers to Singapore. If you so chose to come here, please be ware...the kitchen closes at 10pm even though the time says 11pm."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,12-Sep-17,"This is for sure a hip place to eat with some tasty food to boot. The honey tequila chicken wings are delish! The tacos are tasty - street carnitas, Baja fish and the carne asada are my favs."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,3,6-Nov-16,"Mexican food in Singapore? I'd been on the hunt for months and hadn't found anything decent. Vatos looked promising, so I headed in for lunch one afternoon.  I found it to be just tolerable in terms of food, but was pleasantly surprised by my drink. I got the cowboy margarita. It tasted great and was pretty strong by Singapore standards. There's also a little beer selection in addition to the cocktails. The chicken fajita burrito was disappointing. Its mild spice was the only redeeming quality. Underneath that spice is a bland excuse for a burrito. The chicken was gross and the vegetables indistinguishable. There was some appetizer that was basically fries covered in slop. Again, pretty bland. Large portions. My grandparents were in love with this place. The entire meal they were making comments about how they wished they had Vatos in the US, the fries are SO GOOD, just the right amount of spice, tacos look authentic etc. It was nice to see them enjoying a meal with such enthusiasm. But these are people who voluntarily eat at Aztecas (American ""Mexican"" chain restaurant). I could definitely recommend this place for drinks, but I'd avoid the food if you've had legit Mexican before. As a bar, 4 stars. As a restaurant, 2."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,2,21-Apr-17,"Food was good. Service sucked. Ate (lunch) solo at the bar. Bartender disappeared, he was eating at the table behind me. Waited 20 mins for him to return to the bar. No other server checked on me. When he return to the bar he started washing glasses and didn't even check on me. Had to ask to pay the bill. Apparently half the staff eats at the tables in the dinning room at once. Maybe try getting takeout."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,27-May-16,"Great twist on Mexican, with really fun drinks. Not cheap, but worth the price you pay. Good for a nice evening out with friends or after office. Would not go there with kids though (Did not even have high chairs) The service could definitely improve"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,28-Sep-16,"This is amazing!! I've been looking to try tacos in Singapore but it was really difficult to find a place until I've discovered Vatos Urban Tacos! Ordered the baja fish tacos and the kimchi fries which are both very delicious. Potions were good and prices reasonable too. The atmosphere was also pretty lively, probably due to the full bar and the cool (drake) music playing in the background. I would totally go back to try other flavours!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,13-May-16,"I ended up eating at Vatos for two more consecutive Saturdays with different groups of friends. What can I say? I pitch restaurants really well and my taste is legit! Just kidding hahaha. I've discovered that the mushroom and spinach quesadillas are AWESOME and you should skip the pork belly tacos. The kalbi tacos can be a bit dry depending on the night but the pulled pork is the bomb. Also, the mag's are huge and delicious (hello passion fruit) and as I write this, I think I've persuaded myself to eat lunch there. Now."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,11-Mar-16,"Wow I did not expect the food to be this good at all. My colleague told me we had to eat at Vatos because he went twice and it was so good. I was like ehhhhh its Korean-Mexican and the number of decent Mexican places (whatever the permutation) in Singapore can be counted on one hand. Plus, Vatos is owned by Massive Collective, which I generally associate with clubs rather than F&B.  We ordered the Kalbi and shrimp tacos and the spicy pork quesadillas. The kalbi tacos were amaze balls, lots of flavor, not greasy at all and just the right amount of sauce and onions. An almost perfect combination of Korean and soft Mexican tacos. We also liked the pork quesadillas, which somehow managed to meld the texture and flavors of a kimchi panjeong (not sure how you spell it) and your usual cheese-filled quesadillas. Really unexpected and delicious combination! We didn't find the shrimp tacos too amazing so next time I'm trying the fish tacos, but I suspect Vatos tends to do much better on the fusion items than the straight up tex-mex/mex.  The drinks section of the menu looks really, really appealing and I'm definitely coming back one of these days...after five of course."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,28-Dec-15,"I had mixed feelings about fusion Mexican until I moved to Asia. And I have enjoyed the renaissance in Mexican food in Korea and have been to the original Vatos in Itaewon many times. Their new location in Singapore captures the spirit and tastes, albeit in a smaller space, but at a very nice price point for the Singapore market. The decor is very similar - a distressed space with exposed brick and lamps and iron furnishings. The bar is nice, with many taps but quite small. As for the food, it's a mix of fusion, eg. kalbi tacos and classic, e.g. carne asada, carnitas. I prefer the classic versions and the hot sauce here packs quite a punch. Prices are very reasonable for Singapoire - on average $10-12 for TWO tacos (not one). I loved the Indica IPA on draft, although the price for pint was more than for two tacos (can't be helped here I suppose). I also noted that they had a tamale on the menu but at $15, it better be one damn good tamale. Overall, I'm very happy to see Vatos in Singapore, and the concept and price point should work well in this market."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,3,14-Jul-17,"Simply put Vatos is pretty good Mexican food. Not great, not amazing, but pretty good, especially for Singapore. Good atmosphere as well."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,12-Feb-16,"I'm from Texas, and I've lived in California and visited Mexico often. So I was a bit dubious when I first heard of this new restaurant. I shouldn't have been. It's really good. They have an imaginative menu and have done a great job of combining flavors from Korean, Mexican and TexMex cuisines. Top it off with some good margaritas or ice cold Tiger beer and you've got yourself a good casual place to eat with friends and family. I'll be sure to visit again when I get back to Singapore in a few months."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,14-Dec-15,This is our newest addition to the mexican scene here in Singapore and I must say its a welcome one. I came here from LA and remember when the Kogi taco truck craze first started. This place really gets pretty much everything right. The food is great. I havent worked through the whole menu yet but the pork belly and galbi tacos are amazing. I loved the kimchi fries as well. Everything is great for sharing. They have a great selection of American microbrews on tap as well as numerous margaritas and cocktails.on top of all this its a nice cozy atmosphere. Nice decor and the staff our very attentive and take good care of you. You can tell they work hard to make a great place to enjoy your food and drinks. This is definitely my new go to spot for "mexican". Sure korean-mexican fusion isnt truly mexican but neither is taco bell and I still love it. I'm not afraid to admit that!! So come try this place.
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,3,23-Jul-17,Place is alright. I got few types of tacos. I thought it would satisfy my craving for Cali kogi truck. The meat doesn't really capture kbbq or mexican grill. The tortilla doesn't really taste good and kinda soggy. But the kimchi fries are pretty good. I'd probably come here again for some fries and drinks
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,2,29-Apr-19,"Food has a fishy taste. I'm from California, so I know my expectations can't be high, but would never eat here again."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,30-Aug-16,Good. Very good. Never experience it before. Like it very much. Oh dear. Very very good. Thank you so much. Loving it
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,7-Apr-17,Favorite place from our visit to Singapore. I got the queso dip and carne asada tacos. Food is great and staff is awesome!
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,4-Dec-15,"This place is amazing. I don't oftentimes give props to a restaurant but the combination of great food, particularly Mexican food, with fantastic drinks and a great ambiance gives this place a strong 5*. The staff is also very helpful and friendly."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,7-Apr-16,"Great Mexican food with a nice subtle Korean twist. I had the Pork Tacos and Kimchi Carnitas fries, which did not disappoint. Can't wait to go back!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,2,10-Nov-16,"So, the food here is actually decent -- good spices, flavors and ingredients. What are horrendous are the portions. The burrito is literally four bites, all tortilla with very skimpy portions inside. I've now tried this place three times hoping it was just a one off but it isn't -- the portions are just a complete joke. The owners are intentionally gouging people or don't care."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,23-Feb-16,"Delicious tacos and guacamole. Service was a bit absent minded despite being the only ones in the restaurant. The food is superb. We ordered shrimp tacos, beef tacos, and guacamole. It's authentic and fresh and I cannot wait to return."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,13-Mar-18,"Some of the best barbacoa spring rolls I have had anywhere! Great ambiance. Fat Bastard burrito was good, too."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,20-Jan-16,"Great food! And this is coming from a Mexican-American living in California here on business. I stopped in for dinner after searching for places to eat in the vicinity of my hotel. This place seemed interesting so I gave it a try. I was seated promptly and greeted at the table by chips (fried whole corn tortillas) and salsa. I was pleasantly surprised with the red tomatillo salsa. Good flavor with just the right amount of spice. It tasted authentic. Tortillas (chips) were a little under-fried but still good. I ordered the spicy chicken tacos (orders come in 2 or 3 tacos), and wow! Nice, fresh chicken with a spicy (a little on the mild side for me) sauce and soft corn tortilla. Yes, it was different from authentic so-cal or Tex-Mex, but what do you expect from an Asian infused Mexican joint? I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food and this hit the spot. Paired with a Great White beer on tap and I was in Singapore heaven. Will definitely be stopping by again before I leave."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,22-Jan-16,Love the quesadilla with the Korean pancake twist. The galbi short rib tacos are great too. Reminds me of kogi food truck back in LA. Would be nice if the place has happy hour!
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,22-Oct-16,"Great food, drinks and atmosphere at reasonable prices! ....but make sure to make reservations as it can get busy in the evenings."
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,4,21-Jul-17,"Ordered delivery from this place. The kimchi fries are the best! If there is only one thing you are ordering from this place, it has to be that!"
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,5,13-Nov-16,The kimchi fries are AMAZING. Also loved the soft tortillas on the tacos and their complimentary chipotle sauce with tostada chips. Definitely recommend
Vatos Urban Tacos,3.9,93,Mexican,2,30-May-16,Very under whelmed ..service was fast and efficient though ! Perhaps it was my choice but the guacamole was very bland and the chilli prawns tacos were as well ..hint lime and chilli !!! and 2 prawns per taco.. really ? Sorry more trendy than substance !
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,21-Nov-21,"Still just simply fantastic! The quality coming out of the kitchen remains consistently high, and I am always rewarded for my time and money over the many visits over many years to Blu Kouzina. The old classics that I always recommend remain satisfying and reflect the ethos of allowing quality ingredients to speak through the preparation and presentation. The Greek salad, saganaki with figs, pita with taramasalata, grilled xtopodi (octopus), lamb chops. Other ""must-trys"" include the moussaka, stuffed grape leaves, and rice-stuffed garden vegetables.  I dearly love this place and I'm guessing you will too. Drop by and prove me wrong."
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",3,12-Jul-23,"The food here is decent, but not the best Greek / Mediterranean I've had... but the price point is insane! I never realized how bougie Mediterranean food could get until I arrived at Singapore.  The restaurant itself is nice and seems to be airy - we were seated outside, but the patio was decent. A bit too close to the parking lot (and we heard a lot of bullfrogs), but the decor hid most of that ambience.  We started off with some appetizers: - Three (3)-dip platter of hummus, olive dip, and taramasalata - I liked the taramasalata the most; the cod roe and capers added a very nice salty taste - All the pita types: Grilled, crispy, and gluten-free (we had a gluten-intolerant diner at the table) - The grilled pita was soft and the favourite of the table - Fried calamari - The squid was delicately coated and fried in a light batter. Had a great texture - but I only wish it were more seasoned (I'm a fiend for salt) - Talagani fries - Fried halloumi cheese... I passed on these so cannot give a review!  Then, we ordered a bunch of mains to share across the table - my favourite was the watermelon salad, octopus, and the lamb: - Horiatiki - The quintessential and classic Greek salad; lots of feta cheese was put on this. I personally found the portion size to be quite small for the price - Watermelon salad - Who doesn't love a watermelon and feta salad? Was nice and refreshing, given the heat outside - Xtapodi - Grilled octopus. It had a nice crisp at the end of the tentacles, and was quite well-done - wasn't chewy at all. The flavours were nice and made me realize just how much I've missed grilled octopus! - Grilled meat board - If it were up to me, I'd prefer to choose the seafood platter... but the men I was dining with wanted their meat! One of the two cuts of meat, served with chimichurri, was noticeably more flavourful than the other (I think it was the filet mignon). The lamb chops were delicious, very gamey and well-seasoned - in fact, we got an extra 3 pieces to ensure that everyone would be able to try, but were left with leftovers. The roasted vegetables were normal, but there was a side of creamed... spinach? choy sum? that wasn't very good.  Finally, we wrapped up with dessert - honestly, I found the sweets to be even better than some of the mains: - Baklava - Good with lots of pistachios, but I often find these to be too sweet - Greek Kunafe - This was my preferred dessert, even though I don't love cheese... but I'm an absolute sucker for the spun pastry!  Overall, the meal was nice and lovely - very indulgent - and filled with lots of nice conversation with great company. Would I come here again, on my own dime? Probably not. But a nice experience to try Mediterranean in Singapore!"
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,18-Dec-22,Love the ambiance and location of the restaurant. The service was great and everything was absolutely delicious. Highly recommend this place!
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,22-Jun-23,Good food and wine. Gets busy so try and get there early or book a table before going. The decor is lovely and tables are adequately spaced.
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,26-Dec-17,"I loved the menu at Blu Kouzina. We ordered a range of plates to share and were very impressed by the flavours. Authentic Greek food without any compromises.  The house prepared tzatziki was refreshing, perfectly accompanied by crispy pita bread. The calamari was lightly fried and juicy. The fattoush salad and salmon were delicate in taste and of excellent quality.  Plenty of beverages on offer too. Apart from ouzo, you will find some of your favourites. I particularly enjoyed the oversized Margarita, given the warmth of the day.  Inside, the restaurant is presented like an old taverna with relics from Greece. Welcoming and comforting yet airy, plenty of space to make your party feel at home.  The Dempsey Hill area itself is a great place to explore, with various galleries and antique shops. A pleasant way to spend an afternoon in Singapore."
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,22-Dec-21,Great food and service! We were not sure what to order and Chocky recommended some great dishes to us without hesitant. She described how the food is prepared from the scratch which can lead to your imagination! Look for her if you need some great recommendations. Other staff are also friendly and approachable!
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",4,13-Feb-21,"Very good greek food. Vegetarian friendly, wide range of options. Food is freshly prepared and service is just perfect. Interiors and decors were very nice and cozy. Got quite busy around 1pm. Outdoors is good, but inside was better for us to see the high roof, decors etc."
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",4,2-Mar-19,"On the pricey side... but consistently great food! Third time in two years, and it never disappoints.  Today, fava bean deep and veg moussaka. Both amazing!  Will be back for more!"
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,27-Dec-20,"If I were a teacher and the restaurant was a student I would give it a A+++ for everything. We came here for my sisters birthday today and the service was amazing, the staff was friendly to the highest level and the food was worth it, this spot is suitable of people of any age. I recommend coming to this restaurant for any special occasion as it is a little bit pricey."
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",3,21-Jul-20,"We have been fans of Blu Kouzina since its beginning in Bukit Timah. The second incarnation at Dempsey was the peak. Everything at this new location, next door to the last one, is in every way a step down,except for the price!! The place is more cramped and more downmarket. The food is haphazard. Some dishes remain excellent, others not so. For instance, the lamb chops, while flavourful, are quite tough. Service staff are friendly, but a bit blurred and overzealous, keen to clear up the plates although we haven't finished the expensive dishes. At S$140 per pax at lunch, we thought it was poor value. For Mediterranean food, Pistachio at Wheelock Place is better AND better value. For us, Blu has moved from green light to red"
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",4,28-Oct-19,"Very good and long menu of Greek dishes, with reasonably-priced wines too. The octopus and grilled halumi - simple dishes - are masterfully executes.Service is pro-active and friendly, not pressuring you to over order. No wonder the place is so popular with all nationalities, not only the descendants of Eros..."
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,4-Apr-18,"Huge fan since their old days in Bukit Timah area (I think it was there before).  Visited two days in a row in this Dempsey location and was blown away. I definitely didn't think I would get this kind of Mediterranean food in Singapore with excellent choices of Greek wine. The service is prompt and friendly with a perfect ambiance to feel like it's a sharing type restaurant. Very Mediterranean feel!  I had their chicken skewers with hummus and french fries which was a great choice. The flavor of the chicken was amazing, very moist and delicious.  The second day I tried both their chicken and beef shwarmas which I wouldn't quite recommend as much as the skewers.  Highly recommend for a great Mediterranean meal in Singapore."
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,17-Oct-18,4.5 stars. Greek food at Dempsey Hill. Serves very good Greek grills here - had the lamb and chicken kebab - both were very good. The wrap is also excellent - juicy meat with complementary hummus and veggies. Portions are huge - best if you go with a group and sample various things. A bit expensive but worth it.
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",4,25-Jan-18,"Very rare you have an experience when you want to go back to the same restaurant to eat... and this is one of them. Beautiful decor and ambience. Polite and helpful staff. Even though they do not have kids menu to go with but the place is kid's friendly. Food is perfect to meet your palate. We ordered their signature dips, salad with olives,onions, feta and cherry tomatoes, feta psiti, and a meat platter to share. Ingredients were fresh and flavors were uniquely blended to bring out the taste of each ingredient and the spices used to cook the dishes. And wine paired perfectly to go with our choices of food selection. This place is definitely a must visit."
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,8-Jan-20,"It's so nice when a restaurant really cares about your experience. We've always loved the cuisine here and have never gone wrong with the menu or taking the waiters suggestions. This time we started with a wonderful bottle of Santorini white and wanted another wine to go with our final salad (light dinner night). The bottle we were recommended was absolutely delicious, but just not a good fit with our meal. We politely spoke to the manager about this and he was incredibly accommodating about recommending the perfect glass of white wine that was a superb pairing. The restaurant more than made up for the mistake and the service was great throughout the meal. We appreciate the care the entire staff puts into the experience of the patrons, we will definitely be happy to return. Thank you!"
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,29-May-16,"I adore what they did with their new interior! Beautiful setting and delicious, authentic Greek food. I personally really like the dakos salad. The kalamaki was alright. Almost brings me back to summers I'd spent in Greece!  Only complaint is that the dining area in the back that was designed to be a glasshouse of sorts feels like one, too - when the sun's out it's a sauna in there."
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,3-Sep-17,Best Greek restaurant in Singapore. Service is consistently good and the food is great.
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,1-Sep-17,Though a bit pricey it is the best Greek food that can be found in Singapore. Much of it reminds me of home cooked style that my mom used to make.
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,9-May-18,"We had the pleasure of dining at Blu Kouzina while visiting our expat friends on Singapore. We shared family style and it was some of the best Greek food I've had outside of Greece! The tzatziki, hummus and pita were great to start. We shared a chicken pita, steak and the grilled octopus. Hands down the best octopus I've ever had, it will be very difficult to top. I hope to dine here again on my next visit this beautiful country!"
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,21-Aug-17,"Hands down the best Greek restaurant in Singapore. They moved from Bukit Timah to Dempsey and in my opinion, upped their game. Food and presentation have greatly improved. We preferred vegetarian options to their meats. Having said that, the lamb chops was divine. Waitstaff stellar. Prices a tad high. Will be back again and again."
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,5-Jun-17,Just moved to SG and been craving Greek food for a while. This was the first Mediterranean restaurant we've been to in town. Exceeded my expectations. The Greek salad was just absolutely perfect. As well as the sea bream! Definitely going to be a regular once we get settled here! Hope they keep everything the same.
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,19-Sep-16,My Favourite restaurant in Singapore. The food is super fresh and the service is great!
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",4,2-Jun-16,"Loved the interior decor, but the food was sadly not as good as the previous times at the older location. The appetizers were great, but the meat was a bit tough and lacking flavor. In any event, book in advance because there's always a waitlist and they are almost impossible to reach by phone."
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",4,6-Feb-17,Delicious Greek food in Singapore. It was a little pricey but we thoroughly enjoyed our food. We split a Greek salad and Eggplant Moussaka. It tasted almost like a sherperd's pie with Eggplant and was beyond good. Complimentary bread was tasty as well. Definitely plan to return.
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,24-Oct-19,"Excellent place for a light or heavy lunch. We were here for dinner earlier this week and loved it so much that we came back for lunch. If it's Greek you want in Singapore, this is the place."
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",4,23-Sep-16,"First time trying this place! I'm not exactly a big Greek food fan, but food was great! Totally impressed with the setup! Amazing service!!"
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",5,24-Oct-16,"We went for dinner to celebrate my husband's birthday. The setting is beautiful and the service impeccable. The food is amazing and portion sizes are good for sharing. We ordered a variety of appetizers and were so full that we went straight to desserts then !!! They even brought a beautiful dessert with a candle for my husband, We would definitely recommend this place for authentic and delicious Greek food !"
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",3,13-Nov-16,"I love Greek food, love love love it. I had been hearing about Blu Kouzina since I moved to SG, and my work colleague had been raving about it forever. It was a friend birthday, so I thought, Blu Kouzina sounds like a good choice. Made the reservation online (super easy) A little hard to find unless you know where you're going, but grab cab managed to find it. We were seated at a tiny table way in the back, practically outside the place, which was okay I guess. I noticed many large groups. The decor is very pretty, almost reminded me of a beach place you would find in the Hamptons. Service initially was a little slow, we had a white Greek wine that was decent, $67, and started with some meatballs which were way overcooked. The prices here are not what I would call reasonable, although i realize nothing in Singapore really is, this felt a little inflated. $29 for 3 little lamb chops and some soggy grilled zucchini. :( Friend had the pita which he said wasn't great. The fries I did enjoy, LOL The bread was cold and hard, but the olive oil was enjoyable. I asked for medium well lamb, it was well done. My friend asked for well done meat, his was well done. Personally I've had much much much better Greek food, at much more reasonable prices. They did bring out a dessert with a candle, which was delicious. Nice enough service, but I think I can find better."
Blu Kouzina,4.5,28,"Mediterranean, Greek",4,10-Jul-16,"The place was packed at the new Dempsey location on Saturday night, but the servers were friendly and has suggested a great bottle of wine and helped us with some of the vegan requirements from us too. The saganaki was amazing, grilled lamb was also nice. The portion is small so it's good to order bunch. I'd love to come back and try their seafood next time."
HK Street Old Chun Kee,4,1,Chinese,4,16-Apr-17,"Came here to try crabs in Singapore. Ordered 3 types: chilli, black pepper and salty egg. We loved salty egg the best.  Cash only Open late beyond midnight Open air hawker center by the river With fans"
Beef Yakiniku Dining Yakiniquest,4.5,2,"Barbeque, Yakiniku",4,1-Oct-16,"I ordered the 2nd tier (more expensive one) course - the food was amazing! The amount they give you is definitely not much for the price you pay - that's why I gave 4 stars.  The quality of meat is beyond but they only give you 1-2 pieces of each part of meat and overall, the course was so small that I had to order rice to fill up my stomach.  The bill was over $300 for 2 people (2 course, a few beer, and rice)  You can call them on the same day and book a course even though it says they need 24 hour notice given that they have availability.  Overall Verdict: 4 Taste: 5 Amount: 3 Price: 3 Atmosphere: 4"
Beef Yakiniku Dining Yakiniquest,4.5,2,"Barbeque, Yakiniku",5,17-Oct-17,Best yakiniku I've had in Singapore and I've lived in Tokyo. Top notch service and food quality. Just like being in Japan. Highly recommend.
Unique Pot,5,1,"Singaporean, Chinese",5,4-Jan-16,"Here is near by my office, so 2 to 3 times/week I eat here for lunch. Bak Kut Teh is not so much spicy but just nice for me. The rice for Hainan chicken rice is good flavor, very nice."
Hao Lai Wu Steamboat & BBQ,5,1,"Barbeque, Buffets",5,22-Jul-23,"Visiting Chinatown in the evening we came past Hao Lai Wu and decided to have a bite. Springrolls, fried buns and fried chicken noodles and rice. All equally nice in a pleasant environment. Very satisfying."
JustIN Flavours of Asia,4.3,6,Singaporean,3,17-Jan-22,"Flavors are average, especially for the price. It's a more casual spot within MBS but 3-4 items will set you back about $100 (not including drinks). I left feeling unsatisfied."
JustIN Flavours of Asia,4.3,6,Singaporean,5,1-Jul-18,"After my first visit to JustIN Flavours of Asia, I have subsequently returned to the restaurant twice.  The 2nd time was dinner with my friend from San Francisco on a Friday evening. My friend had the Prawn Laksa which looked really good. I would try this dish one of these days. I, on the other hand, had the Signature Angus Beef Noodle. My beef noodle was very good with a light herbal taste soup. For dessert, I had the durian cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e.  Personally, I love cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e in its original form. I am never into green tea cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e, coffee cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e or any other versions of my favorite dessert. The durian cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e had the right consistency with a more intense flavor. For durian lovers, I am sure they would really enjoy this durian cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e. For me, the dessert was good. I highly recommend to anyone who likes durian.  The staff from my first visit remembered what I had previously. I asked him when the restaurant going to offer the breakfast menu, particularly mee siam. He went to check and told me it would be this coming weekend. He was so sweet to bring an extra chair for my Louis and also gave us pandan macarons on the house. Merci Ben! :)  Note: The breakfast menu is available only on weekends.  My 3rd visit was this morning. Waking up at 7.45am for a bowl of mee siam with my sister for breakfast at JustIN? Sure, no problem!! :D Nothing going to dampen my mood this morning even when it was raining outside.  FOOD 5/5 My sis and I each had the Singapore Breakfast set ($20) which comprised of a fresh fruit juice, a bowl of mee siam and a cup of Vittoria coffee.  Signature House-made Mee Siam with Egg and Live Prawns - The portion was perfect for breakfast. One could order this Ala carte at $10 which to me is inexpensive. My sis felt the mee siam was a bit too tangy for her taste. I agreed but I do like it though.  Chicken Porridge - We also ordered the Chicken Porridge. It was really tasty!!  Gula Java Ice cream - told my sis about the Gula Java ice cream and at the end of the meal, I asked if we could order a scoop of Gula Java ice cream. We both shared the ice cream and I wonder if the restaurant made this ice cream in house. So gooooddd!! Mmmm..   AMBIENCE 5/5  I like the ambience. I finally saw a floor sign next to the door which indicates the main entrance. The entrance is really confusing. I saw some people coming in from the ""back door"" while I was there. However, if it rains, it would be terrible to use the main door leading to outside along the sidewalk with no shelter.  SERVICE 5/5  I have no complaints about the service. Staffs were friendly and attentive.  When I got back not long ago, I saw the receipt and realized they charged one breakfast set less. I called up the restaurant and let them know they charged me less and I would swing by soon to pay for the set. I guess initially the manager thought they charged me more, I like no no you guys charged me less and I have to pay for that 2nd breakfast set. Guess I have to make a trip next couple of days to pay, hehe!!"
JustIN Flavours of Asia,4.3,6,Singaporean,4,11-Jun-18,"4.5 Stars  I stumbled upon somewhere about this new restaurant by celebrity chef Justin Quek at The Shoppes at MBS. Chef Justin Quek's coffee ribs was to die for, I had it years ago and I never forget how good the chef's coffee ribs were.  Located on level 1 (#01-83) at The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands, the entrance to the restaurant was not the easiest to find. It is actually located outside the building. The staff saw I was opening that door, led me in.  I was looking at the menu last night and already knew what I wanted to order, ie The Signature House-made Mee Siam (tangy vermicelli noodle dish) with Egg & Live Prawn but only to be told the item would not be available until probably the following month July. I would come back just for that if that vermicelli dish is available before I head back to Atlanta.  So how was my lunch today?  FOOD 5/5  Prawn & Pork Belly Noodle Soup (5/5)  Since there was no Mee Siam for me, I ordered the Prawn & Pork Belly noodle soup. When the bowl of noodle soup came, I was excited. It smelled so good and looked great. Now now, I learned my lesson in the past, looks can be so darn deceiving. I took a spoonful of the broth, goodness! it was rich and so flavorful. The prawns and other ingredients were generous. I wish there were more of the bean sprouts. This was a perfect noodle soup. Yummy!!  Goreng Pisang ""Split"" - Banana fritter with Gula Java & Vanilla Ice cream (5/5)  The dessert looked esthetically pleasing and the ice cream tasted so good. Both flavors of the ice cream were of good quality. Even though I was so full after that bowl of noodle soup, there would always be room for dessert. And this was one very good dessert!  AMBIENCE 5/5  It was modern yet there were some local accents to the d¨¦cor. I am just not so sure about the entrance.  SERVICE 5/5  The staff Ben took very good care of me throughout my lunch there. He made great recommendation when I was deciding on the dessert. That dessert was spot on. All the staffs were friendly and attentive. My water was never half full.  My tiny gripe, they currently do not take American Express :( I took off half a star for this and the confusing entrance :P  I am definitely looking forward to come back and try the other dishes and hopefully the House-made Mee Siam would be available soon. I am also looking forward to more prominent signage or anything to indicate where the entrance is. Oh, and please accept my American Express please :D"
JustIN Flavours of Asia,4.3,6,Singaporean,5,4-Jul-19,Everything was delicious. Great location by the water. Great service. We ordered a bunch of different flavors and everything was excellent. Good drink selection both alcoholic and non. Definitely will be on my list whenever I visit this great city.
JustIN Flavours of Asia,4.3,6,Singaporean,5,17-Apr-19,- A great place to get out of Singapore's hot weather. Indoor/ outdoor seating - Lots of mixed drinks - Helpful staff - Would Recommend!
JustIN Flavours of Asia,4.3,6,Singaporean,3,28-Jan-20,Can't beat the scenery. It was gorgeous sitting outside at night. My family dined here during Xmas week and it wasn't that busy surprisingly. The food was pricey but that's expected for a casino area. The food was ok. Not bad.
JustIN Flavours of Asia,4.3,6,Singaporean,5,6-Dec-19,This is a wonderful place to go with friends and families. Kelvin is great. He does lots of help and very patient. Beer he suggested is very good.
Stirling Seafood,,,,5,11-Aug-12,"Someone once commented that cereal is like Asian bacon for us. Sprinkle it on anything and it is delicious.  Well I fully agree! In fact, shortly after a trip to the nearby Two Chefs' Eating Place, I was introduced to another place near Anchorpoint at Stirling Road with.. Cereal Chicken. I actually don't really eat cereal prawns normally because the prawns are fried and you have to eat it with the shell, which I don't like. So cereal chicken is INGENIOUS!  That also makes me, according to my boss, a serial cereal eater. Hur.  It was really really good. Barring the fact that we were starving by the time we were there at 9pm after work, the dish stands by its own merits of being so delicious, I kept thinking about it the next day!  The chicken is fried and the cereal thrown in to add that sweet savoury taste. It is not too oily - in fact it felt quite light. The chicken was juicy and the cereal complimented the crunchiness of the skin. I could go on and on about how awesome this is. Just go. Try it for yourself!  We also ordered 4 other dishes that night. Surprisingly, ALL of them were very very good. I am not kidding. This place does good tze char. The fish (top left) was very fresh and smooth. The hotplate tofu was flavourful and had a lot of ingredients. The egg with ""chai po"" (some salted vegetable bits) was also full of unami. Lastly the sweet and sour pork was juicy yet not too sour/strong in the sauce which was done just nice.  If you are looking for an all-rounded tze char place to go for a family dinner or gathering, try Stirling Seafood. I hope you liked it as much as I do because it is a great place! I am definitely going back to try their other dishes and reorder the Cereal Chicken."
Seafood Paradise,4,3,"Chinese, Seafood",4,30-Mar-15,"I know this location is more of a tourist trap but our friends who are SG locals took us there for the Alaskan Chilli Crab dish since we were checking out Marina Bay Resort and I was doing some filmmaking work in that area anyway. We ordered the chilli crab AND the butter crab. Both dishes were fantastic! The chilli crab was super HOT and spicy and the butter crab flavor is to die for! Similar to eating New England lobster, you MUST wear a bib or your clothing will be destroyed! Especially with these delicious sauces splattering all over the place as you crack open the crab shells.  I must say that even though it was pricey and you could probably find this dish elsewhere in S'pore... it was worth every penny trying this famous Singapore entr¨ºe! While you're there take a spin on the Singapore Flyer ferris wheel and then walk over the Helix Bridge to Marina Bay Resort!"
Seafood Paradise,4,3,"Chinese, Seafood",4,17-Feb-13,"Although it's not quite as good as the original location on Defu Road, this place is generally pretty solid. It has a nice vibe with a touch of elegance, and I love the wall of aquaria. I had a couple of minor service issues last time, but they are usually pretty attentive. The crab is pretty good, but if you have a crab craving you should go to Melben Seafood instead. I would highly recommend the coffee ribs, the egg yolk prawns, and the home made tofu."
Seafood Paradise,4,3,"Chinese, Seafood",4,20-Oct-14,"Amazing seafood though a bit touristy and expensive due to the location. The atmosphere is very nice with a high quality feel and fish tanks. The outside is also quite nice as it is on the water. The chilli crab was phenominal. Very messy but the sauce was so spicy, flavorful, and delicious. Cracking it open and dunking in the sauce was fun and tasty. The only problem was the waitress hovering over us while we were eating and talking loudly awkwardly close. Delicious food with a corresponding price."
Lavender Food Hub,4.5,2,"Food Court, Coffee & Tea",4,19-Jul-15,"I tried the chicken rice stall's chicken porridge. The stall wasn't busy and the man behind was busy preparing freshly cooked rice and told me to wait for a while. A few minutes later, he started preparing my porridge. First he scooped up some chicken stock into a pan and when that came to a boil, he scooped up some plain porridge and stirred that in. while the porridge was cooking in the stock, the man took some chicken breast (same chicken for chicken rice) and chopped them into thick slices. He apologized there was no fried dough sticks today. I didn't mind. And I asked to add century egg as well.  Finally he added the chicken to the pot and gave it a good stir. He poured the porridge into the bowl and then sliced up half a century egg. He asked if I wanted the condiments - fried shallots, spring onions, pepper and sesame oil. I liked that he asked and not assume I'll want everything. He was generous with the toppings. Good, because I love green onions in porridge.  The porridge was super yummy! I will be back!"
Lavender Food Hub,4.5,2,"Food Court, Coffee & Tea",5,26-Mar-15,"This is probably as close as you can get to heaven on earth. This is a little away from the downtown area but I specifically stay in rucksack inn hostel on lavender street just to be in close proximity to this place. The food is absolutely amazing and so fresh.  The food stalls are incredibly clean. You have nothing to worry about in Singapore. The stall owners are also very friendly.  One of my favorites from this place is the carrot cake - it's made with eggs and scallops - not entirely sure where the carrot part comes from but wow, it's amazing.  Also you can eat for so little at these food courts. $2.00 will get you a very satisfying meal. Go to the tourists traps and sacrifice quality and quantity and pay $15 for the same thing.  You've got to stop by and try the food out at this place!"
Happy Crab,4.2,12,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,20-Apr-16,"BBQ Crabs! Why haven't anyone else thought of that? A brilliant twist on the Teow Chew Cold Crab indeed. Succulent, sweet crabs stuffed with melted roe cooked to order and grilled to perfection. Minimal seasoning which brings out the natural flavor of the crabs and the burnt unagi sauce was indeed a nice touch. Definitely a welcomed change from the chili and peppered versions.  The place is your standard kopitiam - no A/C - but I'd rather endure the heat for tasty local food than chow down on mediocre food from air-conditioned chains... Remember to call ahead and reserve your crabs if you are planning to go on the weekends!"
Happy Crab,4.2,12,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,11-Apr-15,"If you want a simple but yummy seafood meal. This is the place. Make sure you call to make reservations. Open Mon to Sat. Closed on Sunday & Public Holidays. From 6.30 to 9.30 .. No frills, no air con but worth it.  Best of all they play a great repertoire of oldies songs."
Happy Crab,4.2,12,"Seafood, Singaporean",4,9-Mar-15,"Believe it or not, my favorite preparation of crab is simply steamed with melted salted butter. Happy Crab shares that philosophy with simply grilled crabs, enhanced only by a bit of salt and pepper. The preparation brings out the incredible natural sweet flavor of the crabs and the meat remains firm.  The setting is classic Singaporean coffee shop with golden oldies on the sound system and cheerful, gourmand uncles running the show.  Apart from the crabs, the grilled squid is a winner and if you need some greenery, the kai lan is pretty tasty as well.  Drinks are run by a separate shop, but we noticed that some other (smart) customers brought their own chilled white wine. Not sure if there is any corkage fee, but I'm sure it can't be very much!  PARTING THOUGHT: do be sure to reserve your crabs in advance or prepare for disappointment...1 / person will do nicely!"
Happy Crab,4.2,12,"Seafood, Singaporean",1,25-May-19,"Huge clumps of hair in the food, rude service and the staff thought it was OK to smoke next to our children even when a) we asked them nicely not to and b) it was a non-smoking area. They just stared aggressively when asked not to smoke. And the place was filthy. And the food not very good. Avoid."
Happy Crab,4.2,12,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,21-Nov-14,"Opened by a group of retired air stewards, this place was discovered thanks to my dad. Tucked away in an old coffee shop along Pahang, Happy Crab is.... How should I put it... Happy Food!  If you're tired of the regular chilli, black pepper, white pepper, salted egg yolk crabs and want to taste a crab for its pure, natural flavour, than Happy Crab should automatically be your #1 choice.  I'm giving this place a 5* rating, solely based on its crabs.  Seasoned with just salt and pepper, these crabs are first cooked lightly, then thrown on a charcoal grill to give it that charred BBQ flavour. Mixed in with the natural sweetness, it makes for a killer combination!  Ranging from around $35-$40 a crab, these delightful crustaceans will take away whatever craving you have for a good crab because well... They are that good!!  Your first bite will bring Michael Buble's ""It's a beautiful day"" floating into your head, and you'd be clapping along to Pharrell William's ""Happy"" halfway through your dinner.  The only sad thing about eating here is when you realize that... You're out of crabs!  Apart from the crab, the Fried fish is pretty good too and it's sambal is delightful, but... Everything aside, this place definitely THE place to be fore grilled crabs. 2 pincers up for some awesome crabs!"
Happy Crab,4.2,12,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,8-Dec-17,"Awesome out of the way local crab. Bbq instead of slathered on chili or pepper sauce. Able to enjoy the real flavor of the crab. Cash only so come prepared. The shrimp fried rice with it was the perfect meal pairing. Enough for one. Housed within a Lebanese/Indian restaurant house, or shared rather. So many options. Will revisit again if in the area and in the mood. Very lovely owners/managers, especially nice to this particular American despite Trump and how many are so upset with us."
Happy Crab,4.2,12,"Seafood, Singaporean",4,9-Feb-13,"For friends who follow my reviews, you'd know that I rarely review or recommend local eateries. It's not that I have anything against local food, it's just I so rarely find local food that impresses me enough to make me go ""wow, I need to go review this place on Yelp"".  Note that this Happy Crab at Pahang Street isn't part of the ""Happy Crab"" chain that's present in other parts of the island. This place is one of a kind.  First off. Grilled crabs. They're grilled till good and charred with salt and pepper. There's a real respect for the natural sweetness of fresh crab, and the combination of flavours won over someone who isn't even that big a fan of crabs. I ate an entire crab by myself. That should tell you something.  We also had the best grilled squid I've ever had in Singapore. Grilled with lemon juice, and a little salt and pepper, the squid was tender and delicious. I could have polished off the whole plate by myself, but alas, I had to share.  We also had deep-fried ""sand knife"" fish. I believe locally they're also called ""ikan pasir"". Now, as ridiculous as this sounds, I'm not that big a fan of seafood. But these fish. Deep fried. They were meaty, crisp, not oily or fishy in the least. I ate mine, and a third of my friend's.  We also had sambal fried rice (excellent wok hei flavour, but not enough sambal), sambal kangkong (wasn't that big a fan of the sambal), and a traditional Teochew dish of cooked leeks with tau kua.  The highlight of the meal was what came next. A whole parrot fish, stuffed with fresh chili, wrapped in a banana leaf, and steamed. I think I ate half the entire fish all on my own. I'm a big fan of the clean, fresh heat of chili padi, and the spiciness, combined with the firm, meaty fish was excellent. It wasn't in the least bit fishy, and I found the heat just right to provide that little tingle on the palate, while not overwhelming the flavour of the fish.  All in all, I had an excellent meal, and I cannot wait to go back. I'm even bringing my mum, because she's the seafood lover in the family."
Happy Crab,4.2,12,"Seafood, Singaporean",1,14-Mar-18,"A very disappointing experience. Firstly, it took me not so long to find out the restaurant is operated by two separate crews when I was shown two different menus and asked to order twice. And they are not coordinated -- each said the food on the other's menu is not available right now!  Then I was told that I had to call in advance to reserve a grilled crab, after asking a few times why I couldn't have one crab while there were a lot on the grill.  Okay fair enough, so I turned to the Indian crew for a pepper crab. In result I was served a chilli crab with the reason ""pepper crab is a bit spicy "".... excuse me!?"
Happy Crab,4.2,12,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,13-May-14,"Honestly, these guys should play Pharrell's ""Happy""at this place cause that how diners feel after a bite of that Grilled Crab!  The sweetness of Sri Lankan crabs with the charred taste of the grill (ie burnt at the edges) topped with salt and pepper is just a Killer Combination.  Singapore is known for crabs: chilli, pepper crab, you name it. I haven't ventured enough to try all the crab possibilities out on the red dot, but this indeed is one of the best grilled crab places around. To complement the crab, I would suggest the grilled squid and of course my favorite, rice. Not just any rice, Sambal Rice. It's a little spicy so be forewarned.  The ambience is nothing to shout about. Kind of looks like your typical Singaporean hole in the wall, but then again that's how you know the food is good.  If you are a visiting tourist and have no idea what to order, just let Eddie order for you. He is the coolest shop owner you will ever meet. Believe me, he loves to chat making the experience all the more worthwhile.  Happy crabbing!"
Happy Crab,4.2,12,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,21-Jul-17,This has got to be one of the best crab in singapore! I love the simplicity of the dish and I would always come back - one crab is definite not enough for me.. also the Hor Fun is very very good !!!
Happy Crab,4.2,12,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,10-Nov-18,One of the best crab place in Singapore. They do not have a wide menu but focus to do the best dishes they serve.
Happy Crab,4.2,12,"Seafood, Singaporean",5,15-Apr-14,"It is hard to describe how good this place is. Seriously! We were standing in the taxi queue at the Marina Bay Casino and we thought about crabs. It was pouring down rain. Happy Crabs came up with 1 review. Ok, why not, let's try it. I am a 54 year old crab expert, and these crabs were insanely good!!!! The squid was also off the chart! And the rice was incredible! Perfect 10's on all items. Only complaint is the beer had to be purchased from a different operator in the same place. That was annoying, but the food more than made up for it. Also, we were visiting Singapore and I am on my way to the airport back home now. This was a totally random stop in and it was one for the records. I will never forget it and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes crabs! I cannot wait to return. MC and Eddie are great operators! Mark@funair.com"
Shamrock Cafe,5,1,Cafes,5,23-Jan-18,"The ambience is a chilled, refreshing mix of high design and friendly, calm service. The Food and Drinks are well portioned for the health conscious (not too much carbs) They have Quinoa Salads and Desert cakes and Ice Cream. A great place to have meetings, dates, disccussions, or chill in with a book to whilst the day away. It's Good."
Cibo Italiano,4.2,6,"Wine Bars, Italian, Imported Food",3,11-Jan-18,"Cibo was a new entry in ""The Loft"" when I lived around the corner in Nathan Road. That it has survived is a testament to its success.  River valley is a blackhole for restaurants and bars alike. Ernies came and went, as did Brez'n, Starker, Great Thai and even Toni's Pizza.  Cibo has avoided the churn by offering authentic bites and booze in an understated chilled corner of The Loft that during the week buzzes with activity.  The staff are attentive (and perhaps this is the key), they refill water regularly which is a must in this part of steamy Singapore and they are fast also.  I've eaten the bolognese here (great); the charcuterie & cheese board with balsamic glaze (good); and did 2 take-away pizzas (poor) when I had friends over in March 2016.  The pizzas, sadly, were a miss. Singapore has very good Italian pizza stores outside of the standard fast food fare and Cibo really should have excelled here. It's a shame because pizza should be their hero dish, and it sours an otherwise good experience."
Cibo Italiano,4.2,6,"Wine Bars, Italian, Imported Food",5,28-Nov-16,"I've been here several times and while prices have gone up a few dollars each, it still is reasonably priced. Food here is hearty, the atmosphere is casual. The beers are cheap and good! Italian of course.  I really enjoy the taste of the pizza crust. It's not the biscuit thin type but it's good a nice soft chew with a bit of a crunch to the crust outside. Toppings are quite generous.  Sometimes I like to order some cold cuts and a few of the antipasti. Surprisingly the anchovies are pretty good, and the stuffed peppers always popular for my family.  Generous with the clams. On its own or with pasta. And cheaper than other restaurants.  Often there are interesting daily specials.  I also order takeaway puccia. It's their inhouse made bread stuffed with cold cuts, tomatoes, tuna and chilli. I don't usually go for canned tuna but this combination just works, helps that it's served hot and crops. In fact we often order this to share and have there with other mains as it comes cut into 4 full pieces.  Small selection of deserts but the tarts are always good.  Only one negative. Sometimes it can be hot but they improved it with some fans.  They also are a grocery store selling cheeses and ham by weight and various bottles Italian sauces and condiments. In the freezer at the back are frozen free pasta. Lots of stuffed ones."
Cibo Italiano,4.2,6,"Wine Bars, Italian, Imported Food",4,24-Dec-15,"A nice little Italian restaurant and market. They have a great selection of antipasti, pastas and pizzas. A small selection of Italian wines by the glass and beers, as well as a good wine list. Only stopped by for a drink and a quick snack. Looking forward to going back and trying some of the pizzas.  The staff and the owners are very friendly and nice. The places is quite small with only a couple of tables outside and inside. Nice rustic decor combined with modern. Enjoyable space.  The place isn't just a restaurant but rather also like a mini store. They sell a number of house made pastas, pasta sauces, other premium Italian foodstuffs and the like  Would recommend. Will come back."
Cibo Italiano,4.2,6,"Wine Bars, Italian, Imported Food",3,23-Oct-17,"Went here for dinner and sat inside. Service and decor is good. I ordered the special pasta and it was delicious!! My husband got the lasagna and it wasn't hot enough in the middle, I think they didn't heat it up enough so the outside was really hot but the inside was cold. This and the fact that they served water in plastic glasses is what made me drop 2 stars. Other than that the seem to have a good happy hour deal so I might be back for that."
Cibo Italiano,4.2,6,"Wine Bars, Italian, Imported Food",5,4-Mar-16,No complaints here! Delicious wine by the glass ($8.50+) is what first caught my attention. I decided to stay for the food and was not disappointed! The pizza with tuna is definitely worth mentioning. It's a combination that I had never tried but I can't wait to have it again. Also a fan of their truffle fries (with big slices of truffles) and the pasta. Can't go wrong here!
Cibo Italiano,4.2,6,"Wine Bars, Italian, Imported Food",5,27-Dec-15,Tasty and very authentic Italian. Thin crust pizzas. Good range delicatessen too. Friendly Italian hosts

Mains:- *Duck Confit x2 *Beef Cheek *Day's Special Cut - Black Angus Steak ( All Mains we're all excellent , super delicious & portions just nice , except we were prefer there beans trimmed at the ends) Desserts:- Cr¨¨me Br?l¨¦e Apple Tart ( We we're quite full by now only ordered 1 dessert per couple. Our Cr¨¨me Br?l¨¦e w A handful of blueberries & raspberries was excellent! While the Apple tart w a scoop of vanilla Icecream were both too sweet! A better quality Icecream would solve the problem ,lighter on the sugar in the tart pls. It was very nice that the (only 1) server cum customer service person remembered it was my friend's Bday & plated the Apple Tart w a written chocolate cream writing & a candle in the Apple Tart . It would hv confirmed the overall pleasant experience if that was given complimentary or small dark chocolates complimentary ( since it was a Bday) ,after all our bill was above $300! A price ok for the food, but high for the ambience & decor & basic service received. Food overall was good & worth returning for but service, decor & overall ambience & experience, there are quick ways to improve by few notches , if the biz owner is motivated to."
French Ladle,4.8,5,French,5,6-Jul-19,"Lisa's and Johnny's bistro has been our go-to place when we've wanted to treat friends and visitors to great western (French) food without breaking our bank. My favorite is beef cheeks. Wife's is duck confit. We've tried everything on the carefully planned menu and all is very good. Ambiance is relaxed, you'll feel at-home when you visit."
French Ladle,4.8,5,French,5,1-Nov-17,I came for 2 of my French favourites. Duck confit and French onion soup. All well done. Happy days.
French Ladle,4.8,5,French,4,3-Aug-14,"We tried the beef frites n duck confit. The beef was good but the duck confit was better. The meat simply tears from the bone while the skin was crisp. Eaten together with the plum sauce, it gives an really interesting flavor. Service was good and the place was cozy. Will come again. Remember to make reservations before u go as it gets full pretty soon"
French Ladle,4.8,5,French,5,21-Apr-13,"This is most definitely the best french home cooking restaurant in Singapore. It's a new restaurant, run by a husband-wife team. The service is quick and very very friendly! We had a small group so we basically tried almost everything on their menu. For appetizers, we got the escargot, mushroom soup and french onion soup. I absolutely loved their mushroom soup. It was creamy but not overwhelming, and loads of mushroom flavor. For the entrees, we had the orange duck, beef cheek, pork confit, and a fish. Every single dish was perfectly executed and the meat were all very well done - great on flavor and not overdosing on salt. Our group's favorite was the pork confit... omg the pork simply melt in the mouth, and the sour plum sauce added a great kick to the dish. They served generous portions with a refined flavor at an affordable price. A definite must go for any french home cooking fans out there."
Almost Famous,5,1,"Singaporean, Beer Bar",5,30-Apr-22,"Great little hole-in-the-wall. Unique beer selection for Singapore. I had the Stone IPA. As for food, I just had the roasted cauliflower...I added on the honey sriracha on the side. Yum. Spicy.  I would suggest to add taster glasses. It's hard to commit to a beer you've never had. a cool little joint I'll visit again."
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,5,26-Dec-23,Fine dining by the river. The chicken stew with jeweled rice was perfect - soft fall off the bone. Beautiful river view and kind wait staff. I'm not sure why the bathroom was a tad different than the luxurious interior but use it in a pinch.  Also expect the check to be stiff you pay for the waterfront premium and table cloth service.
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,4,1-Feb-24,Easy to make reservations. Spacious with plenty of seating area indoors as well as outdoors. This is a Persian restaurant owned and ran by an Indian chef and staff. The food was delicious and staff were friendly. What was missing was the essence and the soul of Iranian people. When I go to ethnic restaurants I look forward to meeting the owner and hear their story but what I got instead was a menu with the picture of the chef in it. A little pricy compared to other restaurants I tried in Singapore.
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,4,11-May-24,Food excellent quiet ambiance. Nice to have a good meal there. Food taste fantastic great customer service.
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,5,14-Oct-23,This the way Persian food should be done. Perfect in every aspect. Food was delicious and the service was attentive and curious.
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,5,3-Aug-22,"Amazing food. I travel to Singapore very often from San Francisco. Every time I go, a dinner here is an absolute must. My parents are Persian and I am very familiar with the food. Honestly if these guys were in San Francisco, I would go there at least once a week. For now I just have to settle for every time I come to Singapore."
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,5,24-Feb-22,I visited this restaurant 3 times during my 2 week stay in Singapore and enjoyed it very much again and again
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,3,13-Feb-18,"I think this is probably the best Persian restaurant in Singapore. But for the noticeably higher prices I'd have expected more quantities. I had the kashkebadmjune (very famous Persian eggplant dish) as my starter and it was delicious but they only brought one freshly baked small Naan. Why not bring or offer more pieces (it's only a couple of dollars). For my main dish I ordered the Soltani kabob dish and again for a ~$50SGD dish there was not enough white basmati rice and the kabobs seemed 3/4 of the normal length that you'd get anywhere else I've gone. Overall, a fancier place in great location, good food, but I expected to get more for the money I spend."
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,4,25-Feb-19,"The food scene is amazing in this restaurant! We went on a Friday night to have some yummy Iranian dinner after having heard a lot about this place & it didn't disappoint at all! It was easy to get a table reserved online for 4! The variety of food option for both veg & non veg is a lot! We tried a bunch of vegetarian dishes and they were simply mouthwateringly tasty! The Chef's special appetizer platter was just too good, my favorite was the cheese & hummus dips! The falafel wrap was huge for a person & made very well! Everything we ate was very tasty & well presented! The decor is very Persian and the open kitchen concept is also very cool. The service was tad bit slow but it didn't bother us as we enjoyed our meal with some Prosecco! Next time we would love to try some meats & preferably get an outdoor seating."
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,5,27-Oct-18,"Yup its a solid 5 from us. Food, service and ambience checks out. oh my the humus and cheese are simply divine. tried all version of meat chicken, lamb, beef as well shrimp. excellently grilled and taste wonderful. Ok one qualification - Baclava need to inc pastry ratio."
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,5,22-Jul-18,"I've grown up eating alot of persian food because my mom grew up in Iran, and I've got to say, the food here is fantastic! My favorite persian place in Singapore used to be Shiraz, but rumor has it the head chef there recently moved to Shabestan! We started off with the garlic/dill/spinach yogurt dips which paired fantastically with the warm flatbread. The meat platter of fish/prawns/chicken/lamb kebabs were cooked and seasoned excellently as well as the grilled vegetables. The most impressive was the lamb chops, which we ended up ordering more of. Overall, very impressed and will be back again!"
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,5,31-Aug-17,"Well known restaurant name in Paris , Dubai & other cities. One of the top (if not the best) Iranian restaurant in Singapore . I strongly recommend it although it considered to be a bit pricey."
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,4,23-Oct-15,"I really do like visiting Shabestan when I'm in the mood for some good Persian food. We normally begin with a cider or cocktail, but they do have mocktails available as well.  We often times start with the Halim Bademjan ($13), which is pureed eggplant with braised, tender lamb and green lentils, garnished with sun-dried yougurt and mint sauce. It's basically babaganoush and is a wonderful appetizer, but not Paleo if paired with their bread. They will bring you cut up veggies if you request, and it's delicious! The hummus ($10) is also a great option, but still a Paleo cheat.  I've also had the Soup E Jow ($11), which features barley, herbs, vegetables and chicken. The North Dakota girl in me adores this comfort-food soup, but the Paleo angel on my shoulder disapproves!  Our go to entree is the Shabestan Platter for Two ($95). It comes with minced lamb, chicken, fish, prawn, and a lamb or beef fillet. We always opt for the beef.  In addition to the food, they have a belly dancer on Friday evenings, beginning around 8:00 pm. It's never too hard to get a table here, and we've had luck every time even when we haven't made reservations."
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,5,30-Jun-18,"This one is great!! Either meat out or go veggie, or as I did, both Appetisers are excellent, best hummus I've ever tasted, others had salads and falafel. You need a crowd to justify ordering everything. Mains were kebabs and marinated lamb. The restaurant is worthy of its tagline ""The Best Persian Restaurant ""."
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,5,11-Feb-15,"We came here for lunch since there was a deal on Deal com.sg - $45 worth of food for $18.80. Turns out, it was just their regular lunch menu.  The deal includes soup of the day, a main course (from a limited list) and dessert, along with a soft drink.  For the soup of the day, we got the Ash-Reshth and Soup-E-Jow. The former is vegetarian and had these Persian noodles stewing in a soup of cilantro, spinach and herbs. It was alright. I'm not sure how Persian noodles are supposed to be cooked like but it was a tad overcooked for me. The Soup-E-Jow was sort of a Persian take on chicken soup and it tasted great.  We selected the Lamb Kubideh and Zereshk Polo with Chicken. The Zereshk dish was so-so. It seemed like the chicken curry my mum would make but my friend thought otherwise. However, the saffron rice with pomegranates and pistachios that accompanied the dish was amazing. It was wonderfully flavoured.  The Lamb Kubideh won me over, hands down. It was juicy and just thinking about it right now has got me salivating!! It was just fresh and a definite must try!  As for dessert, we each got a scoop of Persian saffron ice cream with chopped pistachios. Ah...it was really good. Not too sweet and cleansed the palette very well.  This place is a definite must try!"
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,4,11-Sep-17,Main courses are delicious and worth its prices.  They have indoor and outdoor tables and seri even is generally satisfactory.
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,3,20-Mar-17,"I struggled between 3 and 4 stars for Shabestan, because the restaurant has some nice offerings. What I liked were: location, service, food, ambience. But ultimately, the price point was a bit high for the experience.  We sat inside, and ordered the platter for two and the hummus app. The food is good considering there isnt much competition for Persian cuisine in Singapore. Meats were well seasoned, and the portions are generous, which I find true for most Persian restaurants. The lamb and chicken were definitely the highlights, but I would've liked to try a salad as well. I'd recommend you under order on the protein/platter (get a platter for 2 as a table of 3), so you can try another app or salad. Also, remember to ask for a small serving of garlic yogurt and chili padi sauce. They're delicious and help bring everything together.  If you come for dinner, then you might also be welcomed by some lively music and belly dancing. I enjoy dinner entertainment, but if prefer privacy ask for a table inside -it's less audible.  We ended up paying $189, which was the premise of the 3 stars, but I'd come back. The food is good, and I think you can fare better with a little menu hacking and a bigger group."
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,5,7-Aug-18,"I'd never tried Persian/Iranian food before so this is something different for me. The place is located in an area with numerous restaurants from most nationalities. There's lot of competition but this place had its fair share of customers. Service is very professional, helpful and polite although not all waiters could speak English and had to ask for help from a colleague. Firstly I was served a starter with olives, cucumber and cherry tomatoes with hummus. Nice! Then I took a dish that was effectively a flat bread with a dip which was lamb with a mint sauce dressing. Delicious! But....the main course blew me away! Ghormeh Sabzi was Lamb cooked with a gravy on rice for 5 hours, fell apart in my mouth. There was a dried lemon with something in it which was s real surprise and what can only be described a taste explosion! Would love to try more Iranian food. What a nice surprise!"
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,5,13-Oct-14,"Came here last saturday night for dinner. Very nice restaurant with very tasty and high quality cuisine. Definitely try the minty-yogurt drink ""doogh"", which is very refreshing. Great appetizers...try the fried eggplant ""kashke-bademjan"" and yogurt dips. Very delicous meets and kebabs. Nice ambience and great bars around to have a drink before or after! Will return very soon!"
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,4,10-Apr-16,"A little pricey but worth it. Gave us a lovely table with a nice view of the water which made for great ambience. A belly dance performance was included but wasn't the very best I've seen. The food was done perfectly, very flavourful and well balanced. I recommended the platter for two which comes with with an assortment of meats and rice."
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,5,27-Sep-17,"First time tonight for dinner and I realized it's going to be one of my favorite restaurants in SG, (not just a favorite Persian one) as soon as I tried the hummus and the stuffed grape leaves. I'm a sucker for lamb kubideh and have tried the best from LA to Istanbul. Shabestan can give any of them a run for their money. The service is quite attentive and personable and with a smile. I always demand something spicy whether it's chili flakes, chili padi, chopped jalape?o or grilled peppers. Not only did the host/manager give me and my fianc¨¦ two big bowls of mouthwatering spicy sauce each, he also made sure I had plenty of green peppers on the side, grilled to perfection. I can't praise this place enough. The chicken kubideh was delightfully memorable too. Can't wait to go back even though we were there 30 mins ago."
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,5,17-Mar-17,"Loved the location, the atmosphere, the service, and the food, especially the chicken with bones dish. As tender as it gets! Get the chef's special cheese appetizer from southern Iran. Also ask for tahdig (crispy rice). They'll give you some for free."
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,5,1-Jun-19,"We were in Singapore for one week and craving for Persian cuisine. We made reservations here with our Persian friends based on the reviews on YELP. We could tell that the diners here were longtime supports and frequented this restaurant often. This was all a great sign. The open viewing kitchen was a good clue to how great the food would be. We were able to witness the perfection and careful preparation of the kabobs, authentic cooking methods, etc. The rice pilaf and tadik were cooked to perfection. The chef made his rounds greeting all of the diners as well as analyzing what dishes were ordered and how we all enjoyed each particular dish. We could tell that he had passion for what he did and commanded perfection in service as well. We will definitely return and recommend this restaurant to visitors and locals as well. Thank you for being her to satisfy our cravings and taking such pride in your work. What a great evening!"
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,2,7-Apr-14,"We ordered some Kofte as appetizer and a couple of different kebabs as mains. All three dishes were really tasty. Well, the good about this place ends here...  The front of the house staff has no clue! I ordered a glass of red wine; it must have came out of a freezer (not a wine cooler)! Sent it back, to a waitress who did not understand what was wrong with red wine chilled at the same temperature as a frozen Margarita. I did not get it back for a while, neither I was told whether i was going to get another back... the the brought me a new glass.  Right then the first main came, it was mine, they placed it in front of me. The second main comes out two mins later. Obviously it's not mine, I already have one and my wife has an empty table in front of her. The guy, manages to land the second dish in front of me too... the look ""are you kidding me"" was not clear to him. His boss saw him, and signaled him to move it! Doh! :-)  Then a belly dancer came out. Fun show, just lower your music! Especially when there is the part with crazy tribal drums. We are here for dinner...  In the end, the bill. The price is 2x your average Middle Eastern place in Arab street. I don't think it's worth it. Yes, you are right on the Singapore River, and yes the food is well done. But there are quite a few things to improve!  Well, when we sat down on Sat evening, the place was almost completely empty, and Brussels Sprouts next door was fully booked. Now it's clear why..."
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,4,24-Feb-15,"We had such a fun night here - the food is delicious with generous portions. They have a great wine selection and at weekends, a belly dancer provides entertainment during courses.  Due to cute lighting and candles, outside seating offers an intimate environment while much brighter lighting (that unfortunately can't be dimmed) makes for a fun group setting inside."
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,4,27-Dec-16,"The place for good quality Persian food in a cosy ambience ! As we are not familiar with Persian cuisine, the staff was able to give good recommendations, and the dishes turned out to be superb! Definitely a nice place to bring friends to enjoy nice Persian cuisine!"
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,3,26-Sep-18,"Some items on the menu were good - number 20, a walnut and pomogranate dip and the lamb skewers. But the service time taken with only 2 full tables was appalling. We had to wait for a while to order, the staff did not know how to describe the dishes, food took ages to come and we had to wait forever to pay too. I actually asked them what they did when the restaurant was full and got no answer. Come if you have time (and loads of patience) on your hands."
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,4,28-Oct-17,"My first time having Persian food and it was absolutely delicious! The portion sizes were huge (I got the chicken masti). We also got the homemade cheese, hummus and an eggplant salad dish to start for appetizers. Everything was very fresh and the food, although filling, is light so you're not tired after such a huge meal. Relatively pricey restaurant compared to its neighbors."
Shabestan,4.3,28,Persian/Iranian,4,20-May-14,"Shabestan is a Persian restaurant with exotic food. It may not be the best food in the world but it has tasty dishes complimented with traditional Persian bread and a drink of your choice. With warm and open minded staff who make sure your order is right and on time, it is nice place with a good ambience to come for those romantic dinners. If you are currently single or just want hang out with friends it has both indoor and outdoor seating to suit your needs. And top it off with moderate prices you can be looking at a good time with good food!"
Thien Long Vietnamese Restaurant,,,,4,4-Jan-16,"The quality of pho has gone really bad! The soup looked extremely clear and plain in a bad way. No beef taste at all, I felt like I ate plain chicken soup with tough beef slices although you could ass some splash of fish sauce to improve a little bit. Now it's getting harder to get authentic pho in Singapore! So one star for this!  Nonetheless I couldn't help to up my rating to 4 stars because everything else is amazing! They have different special menu for each day and you should definitely go for these: Hu Tieu Nam Vang (every Monday): This comes in its simplest and purest form, is a soup, normally made with pork bones, and served with a type of noodle that is very different from the one for pho or other common vietnamese noodle dish. The broth is light but extremely flavorful and very comforting although the ingredients are so simple. The ingredients are soft rice noodles, topped with some pork ribs and a shrimp, all sprinkled with a touch of pepper, and some chopped green onions and cilantro.  Banh Canh Cua a.k.a Mee Tai Mak in Crab Soup with real crab in it (every Thursday): I'm not Vietnamese but obsessed with Vietnamese noodle soups, to the point that my friends call me ""soup head"". The perfect noodle soup has a complicated broth that enlivens your tastebuds by sight and smell, has noodles that can only be described as silky (al dented has no place in Vietnamese noodle soups), is generous and filling and takes well to all condiments to suit all discerning palettes (whether you prefer salty, sweet, sour, hot or a combination - personally I love salty).  The Banh Canh Cua at this establishment is absolutely Vietnam in a bowl, but not familiar like pho. It is a bold noodle soup - the strong and pungent smell of crab from the thick gravy-like broth tells you so. The noodles are thick and slippery tapioca noodles with aslightly chewy resistance. The dish served here is topped with crab, some slices of pork and not much herbs, simple yet satisfying,  I adored this Banh Canh Cua so much that I could have had a second bowl just for the soup. An incredibly enjoyable noodle soup dish.  Oh, they have great fried chicken wings coated with sweetened fish sauce and spicy garlic snails, that are available daily. What a perfect place for supper or post party eats!"
Thien Long Vietnamese Restaurant,,,,1,24-Sep-15,"24th Sept update: The quality of pho has gone really bad! The soup looked extremely clear and plain in a bad way. No beef taste at all, I felt like I ate plain chicken soup with tough beef slices. Now it's getting harder to get authentic pho in Singapore! They probably changed the chef as I saw a lot of new faces in there except the butch boss."
Thien Long Vietnamese Restaurant,,,,5,29-Jun-15,"So I don't care that this little cute restaurant is located at a seedy place. Great Vietnamese food at seriously very low prices located at the town. If you haven't tried Pho or Vietnamese food at all, and you're up for a casual kind of hipster spot, come here.  I am a huge fan of Pho, also have tried many Vietnamese restaurants both in LA and Singapore but I find the Pho here is super authentic! Both pho and fried spring roll set definitely done right at the right price (like really affordable). The condiments are perfect lined up on the table so you can put as much fish sauce as you can just like me! One of the best values in Singapore indeed.  Everything is great here, but the Pho and fried spring rolls are the best thing on the menu. The broth is savory and the contents of the soup is very filling as they're extremely generous with the fillet mignon haha.  You have to look hard to know you've found the right place as there is no glaring neon sign to tell that you have arrived but it is located at the front row on your left hand side right after a U-turn from elevator. Small and intimate but truly wonderful home cooking with authentic flavour and a herb dish to move your tastebuds wherever you want to go. My friend and I only spent $20 for two main courses (pho & red snapper fish rice), two side dishes (fried & fresh spring rolls) and vietnamese cendol as dessert which I don't really like as it is way thicker than local version. Also, check out detailed menu with prices on some pictures I posted here.  I'm just not a fan of the fresh spring rolls here which they claimed to be the 'real' version because the wrapper is much harder (I guess they didn't soak it long enough). I did try to ask politely if they could help me re-do it again the way I like it and to my surprise they did! I really respect this kind of restaurant staff/owner. The owner is a friendly dude and he is willing to advise which menu would be best for you if you're a newbie. He speaks fluent english and chinese.  By the way they also serve Chinese food option daily for those who don't really like traditional Vietnamese food. I'll be back soon!"
Thien Long Vietnamese Restaurant,,,,4,5-Sep-14,"This place is all types of YAAAAAAS.  For the longest time, I've avoided going to Orchard Towers because of its seedy reputation. But thanks to Yelp, I've learned that there are some legit Thai and Viet eateries on the upper levels. My husband and I wanted to try Jane Thai but it was closed, so the trusty Yelp app pointed me to Thien Long.  From the looks of it, I immediately felt that this was the closest thing to Viet street food I would get in Singapore. Everything checked out: Plastic furniture? Check. Eating in the hallway? Check. Aunties bickering loudly with each other? Check. No prices on the menu but overhearing the bill amounts for nearby tables and knowing that it's only about $8-10 per person? Check.  Let's start with the grilled pork chop with vermicelli. I LOVED this dish. Heaps of noodles, perfectly flavoured grilled pork, pickled carrots, peanuts and scallions + the sauce they pour all over it? YAAAAAAS.  The summer rolls were stuffed with more vermicelli, what I'm assuming is Thai basil, prawn, and pork. Once dipped in the sauce, these were also very satisfying. I loved how refreshing it was.  Miguel's prawn and pork rib noodle soup was also on point. I thought the broth was not too salty and that (again) the flavours just worked.  It's hard to explain, but we just felt the food had soul. You see it when you interact with the servers, as even though some of them speak little English, they smile anyway and want you to have a good time.  I liked this place a lot, so much that I will overlook the roach that crawled on our table (since we were sitting near the hallway, I'm convinced that it came from the bathroom and not the kitchen.) I also want to stress that Miguel and I didn't get sick, either. Like I said in my tip, eating here is an experience! I hope I have more opportunities in the future to stop by."
Thien Long Vietnamese Restaurant,,,,4,19-May-14,"This place is tucked away in an upper level of a seedy building, but it's worth braving the slimy floors and shady clientele for. It might not look like much with the plastic chairs and tables that date back to the 1970's, but this is probably the best pho (beef noodles) available in Orchard road and at a reasonable price.  NamNam might have the long queues and exciting set lunch menu, but this place serves the best pho at a much more attractive price. The beef isn't as thinly-sliced and ""just-cooked"" as can be, but the broth is incredibly tasty (and refillable) and the noodles are cooked to just the right amount of bounciness. The bean sprouts are also given pretty generously, though you can always ask them to hold those if you don't like them.  The pho is a special dish that's only available on Mondays but the regular menu is quite tasty too, with standouts being the Vietnamese pork chop rice.  The staff is extremely friendly and refers to everyone as ""brother"" or ""sister"", and can be counted on to take orders (and custom orders) accurately. The food is also served pretty quickly."
Thien Long Vietnamese Restaurant,,,,5,2-Oct-15,"This particular Viet food stall is simple my comfort nosh. They do a sick duck vermicilli, and tasty pho. Daily specials hovering around $5-6 per large bowl. Don't forget to try their Ice Viet coffee. Yum!  Staff is super friendly and feels rather authentic.  Head to level 4 via lift, and walk towards the toilets. Exit from the nearest door at the toilet and voila you reached Viet food Mecca!"
Thien Long Vietnamese Restaurant,,,,4,5-Sep-14,"I swear my wife forced me to go Orchard towers! I think she wants me to be the Duke or something. :-) In any event, I finally I found a fantastic Vietnamese food joint in Singapore. However, please put your desires for a posh/fancy establishment behind you when coming this eating joint. This amazing food establishment is behind some really shall we say ""interesting"" businesses.  I ordered the Prawn and Pork Rib noodle soup, while my wife ordered the Grilled pork chop with vermicelli and Vietnamese Summer Rolls. The Prawn and Pork noodle soup was everything you would expect from a fantastic Vietnamese dish: refreshing, flavorful, and colourful. They used Sotanghon Noodles / cellophane noodles doused with a tasty broth topped with scallions. Very different from the prawn and pork rib noodles that you often see in Singapore. Please note that this dish is only available on Mondays.  The Grill Pork Chop with vermicelli was also fantastic. I think the key ingredient were the nuts that gave its unique crunchiness plus the fish sauce, which the attendant suggested I pour over the dish. The Summer Rolls were refreshing as is expected of a really good Vietnamese restaurant.  I can't describe it, but you can tell that there is a lot of love put into the food. The patrons who eat there are true Singapore foodies looking for a great meal at an affordable price. Overall, I give Thien Long four stars. The only reason that it is not a five is the place is soo seedy. I guess that's why the food is so good. :D"
Thien Long Vietnamese Restaurant,,,,4,20-Nov-14,"Well well... After a HUGE ""It's so Gooooood"" by the Boss Lady, Michelle, I just had to give this place a try. Walking distance from my office, it's hard to believe that Orchard's infamous 4 levels of sin houses anything else but.... Well... Sin.  Well here's another sin to add to the list. Sinfully good food!!!  Tucked away in a corner lies Thien Long Vietnamese Eateries, which I have to admit, was very very good! I'm ready reviews about their beef noodles that's only available on Mondays but unfortunately, I was there one Tuesday.  Decided to give their prawn noodle (soup) and black pepper duck noodles (dry) a try and i was completely blown away!  When the dry noodles first came, mountain tortoise here didn't realize that I had to add my own seasoning, so I had initially thought it was disappointing, but mix in the fish sauce and that sweet sour lime mixture (I'm assuming it's lime) and the dish takes on a whole different dimension. For those who love the Vietnamese Spring Rolls, this is THE dish to have. Light, fresh, delicate and fragrant, this wonderful bowl of noodles tasted like a deconstructed spring roll, elevated further by the salty, peppery flavours of the duck. In a culinary sense, this dish had everything! It's fuses together the soft chewiness of the noodles, with the crunch of raw vegetables, mixed with the sweetness and saltiness of its sauces, elevated with the saltiness and spiciness of the black pepper. It's like a firework of flavours going off in your mouth. The prawn noodles on the other hand, was what a Pho should be. Al Dante noodles, served in a light yet flavourful bowl of soup, heightened by the scent of fresh herbs. Don't expect giant prawns though while having this dish. Served with a couple of sliced prawns and soft bone pork ribs (I lllooovveeee soft bone), the star of the dish is definitely the soup!  What can I say... I have been humbled and Until I actually visit Vietnam to eat the real deal... This has to be, by far, one of the nicest Vietnamese noodles in Singapore!  Added bonus that the owners are such nice, hospitable folks that don't pressure you."
NUDE Seafood,4.3,4,Seafood,4,23-Sep-18,Visiting on a business trip and was wandering around the financial center when we found this gem. Small and comfortable atmosphere with a solid menu. Great friendly service and helpful with questions for non locals. I had the snapper which came with a side of quinoa. The fish was in a light Asian sauce like miso which was delightful. The dish was perfectly proportioned and was memorable in flavor. I'd go back if I lived here.  If you go at night u can check out the nearby views of some cool architecture.
NUDE Seafood,4.3,4,Seafood,4,15-Jun-16,"Pricey for the actual food but very worth it in this neighborhood. My friend got the salmon steak. At a glance, it looks like a normal salmon steak. However, after taking a bite at it, it was surprisingly amazing! Perhaps because the salmon is smoked too. I got the aburi salmon bowl- not that different from an aburi salmon bowl you would get at a Japanese restaurant. I recommend getting the salmon steak.  The place is also tightly packed, so be aware that you might need to wait at least 5-10 minutes before getting a seat. The environment is noisy, and you have to get the food yourself at the counter when it's ready- which is probably a down-point for this restaurant."
NUDE Seafood,4.3,4,Seafood,4,9-Aug-16,Very nice place to have a meal with friends. Waiters are very nice and service oriented. They were able to give sound advise when we asked them about food and wine.  Their raw oysters are incredibly fresh and plump!! Yum!!  We also had the calamari which was surprisingly tender but crunchy! !!  My main of seabass was a little disappointing but that's because I was comparing against the incredible seabass in a famous seafood restaurant in Oslo.  My friend had pasta which was Ok.  We did not have dessert because we were told by friends that their desserts were not that nice.
NUDE Seafood,4.3,4,Seafood,5,22-Mar-15,"This place is packed every single lunchtime!  I don't need to write a review.  But I will say that the service staff are very professional, clearly passionate about their food, and cause, and love what they do.  The pairings of seafood, sauces and vegetables are incredibly, light, tasty, and delectable. Though at 180grams per serving, the fish pieces are too small for me. The veggies do have grain options, that would fill others up, but for me, I usually ask them to double up the veggies.  The simple desserts are light, full of flavor, with almost Japanese levels of precision.  It's my new weekly lunch spot. And I work in Orchard : )"
Blue Jasmine,4,1,Thai,4,28-Dec-18,"Good thai food, a large & well decorated restaurant, overlooking their lap pool with glorious fresh sunlight pouring in thru floor to ceilings windows, while you are kept chilled with high ceilings, air conditioning and entertained with their detailed floors. The view across the pool is nothing lavish, and they could have done more with greenery but the staff was attentive, polite and knew their menu well."
Fat Bird,4,9,Chinese,4,28-Nov-16,"I have only ever had the la zi ji (À±×Ó¼¦) here because I just keep ordering it. It is OMG good. Very tender, boneless chicken that is not just spicy, and numbing, but truly fragrant and smoky as well. Salty, but not overly so, and not at all greasy (for a fried dish). After I eat all the obvious chunks of chicken, I'll spend another 5 minutes picking through all of the chilis to find the tiniest crunchy bits because it is that flavorful and addictive.  Be warned though, if you ask for it spicy, the *will* make it spicy, even if you are an ang mo! (No need to emphasize that no, actually you know what you are doing and you actually do want it very very spicy, which is the only way I can usually get a scoop of chili around here.)  I enjoy the cleaner/newer than a hole-in-the-wall interior, and when you get take away, they will cut the corner of the container so that the fresh out of the wok chicken stays crispy in transit!  UPDATE: I have now also had the mala chicken dry hot pot. Have to say that even though we ordered it at the highest spice level, it was not nearly as spicy as the la zi ji, AND it was not particularly ma la. (Lacking in the ma) It was good, but not a party in my mouth. Five stars for the la zi ji though."
Fat Bird,4,9,Chinese,4,4-Feb-13,"Living in Singapore you get exposed to a lot of foods that we from the west would consider... irregular. Things like Turtle Soup, Chicken Feet, Eel Skin Crisps, Pig Organ Soup, the list goes on and on but sometimes you find a dish that might sound familiar yet different and tastes amazing. We walked by a lively little restaurant called FAT BIRD and were intrigued, the slogan is ""Chong Qing Chicken Hot Pot"" and each table has a camping stove on it with a Claypot filled to the brim with meats, veggies and goodness. We decided to give it a shot and I'm glad we did, the hot pot was amazing.  There are two styles available: regular and spicy fragrant and you can choose your level of spiciness: mild, medium or extreme. Next you choose the size: small or large, the meat: Chicken, Pork or Fish and then you choose all the veggies, noodles and/or rice. A few minutes later a big claypot comes out filled with everything that your ordered and you happily eat away as it bubbles on your camping stove. The kicker here is the broth, rich, spicy and complex. I could go back just for the amazing broth alone but mixed with the chicken and veggies - it was outstanding. Price wise it's a winner as well, we had the large Chicken soup for three, lots of veggies, rice & noodles as well as three lime juices and including tax and tip, the bill was $60. For the record, we couldn't finish the pot of soup.  If you feel like a casual and interactive dinner out with friends and want something reasonably priced as well, then I highly recommend FAT BIRD. It's a tasty night out that is sure to leave your stomach satisfied."
Fat Bird,4,9,Chinese,5,13-Aug-12,"Craving for hot pot? Fat Bird offers a distinctive dining experience in this aspect, treating you to braised chicken simmering in generous amounts of delicious sauce. It's very much like a steamboat, with the main difference being that your soup base is dark sauce with a customisable spiciness level: mild, medium, and hot. You can order a host of side dishes such as enoki mushrooms and lotus root, and these will be added to your hot pot upon serving.  Since Fat Bird comes from the same people who gave us the unique and tantalising food at Chong Qing Grilled Fish, we anticipated that the spiciness of the soup would be above normal levels, and so we opted for the mild level. The choice turned out to be the right one, for even this mild version sent us fetching for cups of Jia Jia Liang Teh!  The interior of the restaurant provides a cosy setting in which you could talk for hours over the bubbling pot of soft, tender chicken. A definite choice when thinking about where to head for dinner with a large group of friends!"
Fat Bird,4,9,Chinese,4,29-Jul-15,This place has yummy dishes. Got a lot of spicy dishes too. Too spicy for me. We eat here several times when staying in Singapore. I like that seating is both indoor and outdoor. Good service. Wait isn't too long even if they are busy.
Fat Bird,4,9,Chinese,5,23-Jul-16,"Food is good. Service is excellent. If want to pick, it will be the price. It's quite expensive."
Fat Bird,4,9,Chinese,4,29-Jun-15,Finally got my mala fix here. Delicious and tasted just like the spicy dishes we ate when we lived in Beijing. The chicken was tender and I loved all the different veggie options we could add to the pot. Definitely would go back.
Fat Bird,4,9,Chinese,4,9-Sep-12,"This restaurant has the same owners as Chong Qing Grilled Fish, which pretty much assured me of the high standards there. Fat Bird's house specialties include the Chicken Hotpot and Spicy and Fragrant Pork Rib Pot where you can pick your own level of spiciness.  Feeling greedy that day, I decided on ordering both the house specialties - spicy kampong chicken hot pot and spicy pork rib pot. I know, both dishes were spicy and were asking for it. The chicken hotpot was phenomenal. The chicken was smooth, tender and had so much flavor concealed within. The spicy broth provided the needed kick. The pork ribs were tender too and probably had been stewed prior to that. The portions were rather large and the hotpots were served on top of small gas stove to keep warm throughout, which was a considerate gesture."
Fat Bird,4,9,Chinese,5,24-Mar-15,Really good chicken hot pot. Get some steamed rice. Medium spicy and then there you go. also their mixed fruit flavor drinks with the fizz were pretty darn delicious as well. Not a fancy place. It's actually a small hole in wall. An order of the hot pot serves about 2 people.
Fat Bird,4,9,Chinese,1,6-Sep-16,Watch out the waiter or waitress won't tell u there is a buffet but trying to charge u for everything. One of my dishes I ordered never turn up. Foods are very salted and oily. Service is very rude.
Kai Garden,4.4,13,"Cantonese, Dim Sum, Seafood",5,29-Dec-22,"My family frequents here at least annually with a party of at least a dozen if not more. Service is always on point and food constantly flows and drinks are monitored and replenished quickly.  The star of the show is always the Peking duck which comes with a fantastic explanation by a staff member of what sauces and wraps come with it.  We also order other dishes like dim sum har gow, cheong fan, xiao long pao and noodles like efu noodles.  Food is amazing and we always look forward to going back!"
Kai Garden,4.4,13,"Cantonese, Dim Sum, Seafood",5,10-Nov-22,"Went to Kai Garden on a Tuesday. It was very crowded, waited for 20 Mins for a table.  Service to be frank was quite good, Maybe because I arrived late and they wanted us to finish sooner. The food taste profile is actually mostly Above average. My favourite dish is the Black truffle Angel hair paste, it's delicious !  Would I recommend people here ? Yes of course !"
Kai Garden,4.4,13,"Cantonese, Dim Sum, Seafood",5,17-Jun-22,"A friend just took me here for duck. I've had Peking duck a bunch of places including one that presidents go to in Washington, various spots in London etc. this was top of the list. And the dim sum was amazing. I wish I knew everything he ordered. Top knot h."
Kai Garden,4.4,13,"Cantonese, Dim Sum, Seafood",4,9-Feb-23,"A typical Cantonese restaurant. The differentiator was the Peking duck served in a novel way - 5 different sauces (traditional, black pepper, sesame, seafood or special mixed) and 5 types of skins/wraps (original, pumpkin, spinach, bamboo charcoal and beetroot)."
Kai Garden,4.4,13,"Cantonese, Dim Sum, Seafood",4,9-Mar-22,"good dim sum at kai garden, marina square. the beef hor fun was delish with tender beef slices so as the bbq char siew pastry. another option for good dim sum in singapore. will be back!"
Kai Garden,4.4,13,"Cantonese, Dim Sum, Seafood",5,23-May-23,Amazing food all around. Was so fortunate to be able to try so many of their dishes with family.
Kai Garden,4.4,13,"Cantonese, Dim Sum, Seafood",3,15-Sep-18,"We pre ordered the whole duck $88 .... a little different twist with tri color pancakes and 6 different sauces. It was all about average.. not the best, but not the worst. Had it 2 way, with noodles afterwards, noodle didn't have much taste... Service was attentive.... Bill was overpriced for the 2 dishes..."
Kai Garden,4.4,13,"Cantonese, Dim Sum, Seafood",3,16-Sep-19,"Review of the new Kai Duck restaurant at Takashimaya. Understated, casual but chic atmosphere. The long menu scores high on innovation, with lots of creative dishes or classic ones with a new touch. Unfortunately- and this may be teething issue only - execution can be improved: the duck tongues are too soft, the poached rice a bit too bland, the chilled black fungus a bit too salty, the roasted duck is less good than at ImpTreas or Crystal Jade, etc. The high-on-innovation/average-on-execution comment also applies to the staff uniform: unusual but highly unlikely to win any fashion award."
Kai Garden,4.4,13,"Cantonese, Dim Sum, Seafood",5,15-Apr-16,"Nice ambience at open sitting area with rooms available for business meeting followed by lunch.  3 ladies had the following: Chilled cherry foie gras, xiao long bao, fried charcoal pork bun, honey BBQ pork (charsiew), stir fried garlic kailan and braised vermicelli with fish & dried scallops.  We could not try any desserts coz were too full.  Staff were generally attentive and can understand English apart from my colloquial Mandarin/Cantonese"
Kai Garden,4.4,13,"Cantonese, Dim Sum, Seafood",4,29-Dec-15,"Kai Garden is helmed by Chef Fung Chi Keung, the one who created the colorful Xiao Long Baos at Taste Paradise. Here, other than delicious traditional Cantonese fare, you have Cantonese fusion dishes as well. I like it that Chef Fung actually thought of putting the sweet & sour pork on ice to preserve its flavour & crunchiness of the exterior. You definitely must try the crispy Peking duck, sweet & sour pork on ice & Kung Fu Tea here!"
Kai Garden,4.4,13,"Cantonese, Dim Sum, Seafood",5,17-Feb-16,"I'm pretty skeptical about marketing gimmicks such as labels like 'Top Restaurant in X"" and ""Best Y cuisine.."". You can so imagine this cynical one rolling her eyes when she receive the invitation to taste the ""Best Peking Duck in Singapore"". BUT seriously, newly opened Kai Garden at Marina Square really lives up to that label. Consider me impressed with Chef-Owner and Executive Chef Fung Chi Keung's traditional Peking Duck when i tasted it. It was indeed the best that i've had.  Chef Fung was previously from the Paradise Group, so you can be expecting a strong Cantonese cuisine at this 200-seater restaurant in Marina Square.  So the glistening Peking Duck ($88/duck) is definitely the star here. The crispy skin was simply amazing (and i don't even really enjoy skin). The layer of fats under the naturally colored, browned crust simply renders beautifully in one's mouth. It doesn't taste too oily even.  Accompanying the duck is an interesting selection of wraps- Original, Pumpkin, Green(Spinach), Bamboo Charcoal, and Beetroot.  While the wraps didn't taste much of their stated ingredient, they added pretty colors, plus a great texture and balance to each bite. It's fairly thin, with just a light amount of chewiness, and it remained fairly moist even as the baskets made their rounds around the huge dining table. There are also 5 sauces that come with the dish (Duck, Black Pepper, Sesame, Seafood, or Special Mixed). Well i was happy with the regular sweet salty original duck sauce.  The Double-boiled Japanese Matsutake served in Tea Pot ($38/pax) was stellar. The Matsutake is Japan's answer to the black truffle (it's very rare and unique) and it gave a sweet and earthy balance to the traditional Cantonese soup.  Grouper in Lobster Soup (seasonal price) is a simple fish dish, flash cooked in a super umami Asian lobster bisque. It's rich without being too heavy. And the fish was given the TLC on the spot for that perfect doneness. I could have a whole pot of this easily.  While i'm not exactly sure if serving crispy food on ice helps to maintain the crunchy texture, i enjoyed the Sweet and Sour Pork on The Rocks ($22/serving). I was afraid that the balls would be cold but thankfully they were warm still. The light crunch batter encased the juicy roughly minced pork and the sauce was balanced with the right amount of acidity and sweetness.  Deep Fried Vegetarian Roll ($22) is a beautiful web of bamboo fungus that holds a juicy mix of vegetables and mushroom with tofu. The texture is amazing and the layers picked up the delicious pumpkin and chicken stock which was an intense reduction that i couldn't stop spooning. But other than that, the filling was pretty standard.  If the bao skin were any indication the standard of their Kai Garden's dimsum, i would be here every weekend for brunch. Or supper if it's available every night. The Pan Fried Charcoal Pork Bun ($6.80 for 3pcs) is actually a xiao long bao in disguise. First the crisp crust, then the fluffy skin, and the juicy pork and broth in the center of it all. -slow clap- tears of joy-  The meal concludes perfectly with the Chilled Fresh Coconut Puree ($6.80). This is such a great dessert! I would come back just for desserts alone.  Kai Garden definitely has my vote for Best Peking Duck in town and I'm looking forward to sampling their Dimsum as well. For all you know, they may bag the Best Dimsum in Singapore title too."
Kai Garden,4.4,13,"Cantonese, Dim Sum, Seafood",4,11-Nov-16,Delicious peking duck with different sauces and variety of wraps.abalone was good.try the fried fish skins with salted egg yolk
Kai Garden,4.4,13,"Cantonese, Dim Sum, Seafood",5,2-Sep-18,"Ok, after almost a decade of searching for Hong Kong quality yum cha / dim sum in Singapore a colleague recommended Kai Garden, and it was insanely good. Cornered away in Marina Square, this non-description looking Chinese Restaurant actually has some good views over Marina Bay and lots of natural light. We worked our way through the classics, siu mai, har gao, char siu (kurobuta), chive dumplings, xia long bao, char siu pau, cheong fan (excuse all my spelling). Everything that came out was as good as I've had anywhere in the world. Service was also great, my daughter was really cold so a waitress brought her out a blanket without us even asking. Very sweet. We were actually discussing going back the next day. Stop reading and go book this place now!"
Penang Seafood Restaurant,4,14,"Malaysian, Seafood",5,23-Jun-24,awesome popular local spot with delicious specialties like assam fish head. tangy and spicy with tamarind and pineapple. they have a small private room now to book (quieter) fermented pork belly salted egg calarmari penang char kway teow with smaller noodle hokkien mee giant chives marmite chicken prawns in herbal broth enjoyed all the dishes very much!
Penang Seafood Restaurant,4,14,"Malaysian, Seafood",5,26-Jun-23,"Great food at affordable prices. Everything we ordered was served hot and delicious. The waitress was very attentive and very helpful. She was very quick to replace our plates and bowls when we requested, despite it even s saturday and at peak hour for dinner time. We packed leftovers to bring back and she even added a little container of sambal chilli for us to bring back!"
Penang Seafood Restaurant,4,14,"Malaysian, Seafood",4,7-Dec-15,"Char kway Teow (black, not the white one) thin noodles, some shrimps and the other ingredients (including cockles) were just so tiny. Overall good taste. Good but not great.  Penang laksa - very nice but the soup would be better if thicker."
Penang Seafood Restaurant,4,14,"Malaysian, Seafood",3,15-Aug-16,"Did a last minute check with the buddy who stays in the area as our ""dictionary"" for food is running out of ideas as we were quite limited to the usual Beef Kway Teow and Frog Porridge in Geylang for dinner. She recommended Penang Seafood Restaurant which is just a stone throw away from Ajunied Station.  The Penang Restaurant which is also serving Cze Char is bustling with people. Not to worry about the seats as the turn over rate there is rather high. Servers are rather polite and quick to attend to our orders.  The environment gave a feel that we are in Malaysia and even the variety of drinks they served is so closed to what the usual coffeeshops in Malaysia offers, Ice Jelly, Herbal Tea and even Lime juice with sour plum.  Lime Juice - $2 Each  The safest choice to order if you are lost among the dishes in the extensive menu. If you have heard of Penang Cuisine, Assam Laksa is one of their staple dishes. This signature dish of theirs is sour by default with Tamarind (Asam). Look around the tables, I bet you will see majority ordering this. And if you like sour and sweet food, this is a perfect choice as the bowl is filled with ingredients like shredded cucumbers, onions, chillis, pineapple, lettuce and mackerel fish. The level of sourness is very well executed and appetizing. Better than average and its addictive.  Penang Assam Laksa - $4.80 (Small)  Penang style of Char Kway Teow is usually not of my preference as I prefer the Singaporean style that is usually coated with the sweet black sauce. Surprisingly, these plate of flat rice noodles was remarkable with its ""Wok Hei"" taste coupled with ingredients like bean sprouts, cockles, chinese sausage, prawn, guchai and egg. Its aromatic but just too bad, the man insisted that he prefers our local style.  Penang Char Kway Teow - $5 (Small)  With Salted Egg Yolk trend still in the hype, they have kept their food menu up to date! With this being the chef recommended dish, I had expected more with something outstanding. No doubt the sauce is creamy and yummy, the dish still lacked the fragrant as well as the Wow factor.  Fried Sotong with Salted Egg - $13 (Small)  Beware of the steaming hot plate below the bloated aluminum pack. Loving the way how this dish is prepared in the aluminum pack and slit open in front of us when being served on our table. Herbal taste is evidently packed with an alcohol infused whiff from the Chinese wine. Steamy herbal soup is sweetened with the use of sweet dates and wolf berries. Beside that, ginger strips and mushrooms were also part of their ingredient. All was good except that I'm not too keen with chicken with bones bits in it.  Hot Plate Wine Chicken - $16 (Small)  Penang Seafood Restaurant offers a decent fare of Cze Char dishes and since there are many other signature dishes like LaLa and Hokkien Mee that we have yet to try out. I don't mind coming back again."
Penang Seafood Restaurant,4,14,"Malaysian, Seafood",4,10-Feb-16,"When its the Lunar New Year and literally every single Chinese Restaurant is closed, there is a lot of pressure to give my tourist friends the opportunity to try Singapore's famous Chilli Crab and Pepper Crab. Penang Seafood Restaurant to the rescue!  Forget Jumbo, Long Beach, No SignBoard Seafood (not the one in Geylang), Penang Seafood Restaurant offers a true local experience. The food is fantastic, service is ehh (our waiter constantly struggled to finish his train of thought when trying to explain something or answering one of our my queries), ambience, well, it's a little run-down (its Geylang after all).  In terms of the stars of the show, the Chilli Crab and Pepper Crab respectively, they were solid and every bit satisfying. The sauce of the Chilli Crab was definitely on the spicy side, but not unbearable. I still prefer the thick, sweet, slightly spicy sauce of the Jumbo Seafood Chilli crab, but nonetheless the Chilli crab at Penang Seafood restaurant was a good alternative. The Pepper Crab was unique. It was the first time I tried a saucy Black Pepper Crab. The ones I'm used to are definitely not drenched with all that pepper, but smatterings of pepper here and there. Surprisingly, it wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be.  Overall, a great location to grab Malaysian/Singapore seafood favorites. I still prefer Jumbo's Chilli crab or Long Beach's Black Pepper Crab outright. However, if you factor the roughly 20-30% discount offered at Penang Seafood for the very same dishes vs. those offered at SG's famous seafood chains, then the comparison is just about even. :D"
Penang Seafood Restaurant,4,14,"Malaysian, Seafood",3,24-Sep-13,"We went there for 3 Penang dishes - char kway teow, Penang Hokkien mee (prawn noodles) and Assam Laksa.  The queue was long on a Saturday night, at around 830pm. The guy managing the line and order taking was very efficient. He remembered where people were seated and what they ordered.  What took us by surprise was that if you only have 2-5 in your group, you could be sharing a big round table with other parties of 2-5 too. The good thing, your wait could be halved. The bad thing, it was hard to have a proper conversation with everyone seated along the curve of the table. Our table had 3 other groups of diners. It was a bit disconcerting to say the least. There are a few numbers on the big table to indicate the various parties.  We did not try the zi char dishes though the fish curry which seemed to be a favorite of many tables looked delicious.  The Penang dishes we had, while good, were a bit underwhelming. Maybe our expectations were high after reading the good reviews on Yelp and other personal blogs.  Char Kway Teow - the spiciest of the 3 noodles dishes. The squeeze of lime cut the grease a little and added a zesty refreshing taste to the otherwise lard laden rich dish. There were tiny cockles (quite yum), sliced lap cheong (chinese sausage), sliced fishcake, prawns and beansprouts. Best to share as it can get a bit too much after a while. I did not detect much of a char (wok hei) taste to it.  Assam Laksa - very good assam gravy which was very thick and full of flavor. The fish did not disintegrate into tiny bits like in most places, but you could find a few full pieces of fish. A generous lashing of hae kor (prawn paste sauce) was added to the dish when served.  Penang Hokkien Mee - this was what we called prawn noodle soup. I liked this even though the soup was not one of the best. It was good enough with an acceptable prawn taste to the soup. We ordered the small prawns and they were really small, almost like the dried shrimp if they shrink any further. The soup was a bit spicy but the noodle itself was fine."
Penang Seafood Restaurant,4,14,"Malaysian, Seafood",4,15-Jun-16,Excellent spread of Malaysian classics as well as more novel dishes. You can choose to have a banquet of 10 dishes or simple noodle dishes which are no less delicious and satisfactory :-) we always order the Lala Hokkien Mee!
Penang Seafood Restaurant,4,14,"Malaysian, Seafood",4,30-Sep-12,"Somehow I feel that Penang food cannot be totally replicated outside of Penang, but that being said this place comes really close to the real thing.  When I come here I don't really go for the zi char because zi char isn't something that's unique to Penang alone. What I go for are three dishes - the char koay teow, Penang laksa and the Penang Hokkien Mee. The char koay teow comes close to Penang-style ones but the noodles they use are slightly thinner compared to those you can find in Penang but taste wise is pretty similar.  The Penang laksa here has a thick assam gravy which is a bit different from those in Penang, In fact, Penang laksa is a bit more watery and soupy. So slightly different in style.  The Hokkien Mee (or prawn noodle) is pretty good and tastes the same as those you can find in Penang. Really spicy too, no need to add more chilli into this one."
Penang Seafood Restaurant,4,14,"Malaysian, Seafood",4,24-Jul-17,"Solid and inexpensive.... Always a long line, which is a good sign, so you may want to show early"
Penang Seafood Restaurant,4,14,"Malaysian, Seafood",5,2-Sep-17,"Authentic, tasty local Singaporean favorites such as Assam fish head, fried hokkien mee (noodles) with real clams, braised tofu with broccoli and mushrooms, etc. I truly satisfied my local food craving! Try to make a reservation to avoid long queues!"
Penang Seafood Restaurant,4,14,"Malaysian, Seafood",3,13-Aug-12,This is a zi char place that specializes in Penang food - the Penang Assam Laksa and Char Kway Teow is quite famous if you like that sort of thing. I personally loved the cereal chicken which is served in a nice creamy sauce and crispy oats. YUM. Overall the food is quite good and homey which is great for a zi char place.  I also like the that the location is really close to Aljunied MRT station. For drivers there's a little open-air carpark there but you might need to wait a bit for lots to turn up.
Penang Seafood Restaurant,4,14,"Malaysian, Seafood",4,10-Dec-16,"This is the place for Panang laksa. As good as Penang? To be fair, it gets close. I've had it 2-3 times. Good stuff."
Penang Seafood Restaurant,4,14,"Malaysian, Seafood",4,18-May-13,"Open late and it's practically just outside of Aljunied MRT - big pluses for a tourist like me. Oh, and the fact that the food taste awesome doesn't hurt either. My friend insisted to take me here because he said it serves the best fried bee hoon that he's ever tasted in Singapore - seeing that he has lived for a while there and always eat out, I felt that I should just give it a try and boy, how I'm glad to try. The bee hoon is great, as well as the cereal prawn, kangkong belacan, and other dishes. There are 3 sizes for the dishes: small, medium, large - which the waiters can suggest depending on how big your party is. If you think you're not gonna eat much, just order the next smaller portion to what he suggested."
Penang Seafood Restaurant,4,14,"Malaysian, Seafood",4,17-May-15,"My Malaysian friends recommended that I try this place, saying that the food is as good as the ones you get in Penang. I have only been to Penang once so I headed over with open expectations. Tried their char koey teow and lala hokkien mee. Can't really say it's authentic Penang flavour but it certainly was the best I've had in Singapore. The koay teow they used is thin and light in colour but extremely tasty. Their salted egg sotong is also very good. Highly recommend this place; cheap good food!"
Isle Eating House,,,,4,28-Dec-14,"Hidden on the second floor of Park Lane Shopping Mall is Isle Eating House, a simple coffee shop located in the heart of Dhoby Ghaut.  Not always common, but self-service curry gravy. For those like me who love a ton of curry gravy on their rice, this is perfect. 50 calories per scoop of curry gravy does deter me from flooding my rice with curry gravy.  A great mix of meat and vegetables! Anything you could possibly want.  For $6.90 you can get two plates of rice for two people! You could probably only afford a plate of Indonesian mixed food rice at the Plaza Sing Food Court just a 5 minute walk away.   I love my potatos and I usually get some form of potatos from any chai peng (mixed veg rice) stall and this tasted pretty good. The potato slices were pan fried first, before getting cooked, as you can see the charring of each potato slice and some even tasted crispy. The omelette egg was decent, not too salt and they were generous with the serving of the omelette. I enjoyed munching on the omelette that was drowned in curry gravy. The chicken pieces were okay, tasted like the normal fried chicken you get from a chai peng stall. But for $3.50, I felt it was reasonably priced for a meal in the city area.  Finding Teh-O, Kopi-O for 90 cents and Teh, Kopi for $1, is very reasonably priced in the city area!  Specials for just $2  For $2, what meal can you get in the Dhoby Ghaut area? At Isle eating house, you can either get 2 crispy roti prata or fried carrot cake!  Definitely my choice of cheap eats if I'm near Peace Centre, or before I head to Teo Heng at Hotel Rendezvous."
Isle Eating House,,,,5,10-Jun-15,"This humble eating house is on the second level of Parklane Shopping Mall, a rather rundown place that reminds you of what malls were like in the 80s and earlier part of the 90s. There're also dodgy looking shops like massage and spa parlors, KTV lounges, money lenders, a ""photon energy waves"" ""health"" supply shop, a suspiciously darkly lit LAN gaming shop and plenty of empty units.  However as we know, the only thing ambience guarantees you is high prices. Well okay the air conditioning here is quite anemic, but you don't linger in this kind of place anyway.  I took a walk around this shopping centre at lunch time and this was the most popular of the eating houses in the building so I decided to try it.  There're several stalls in this unit; so far I've patronised the economy rice and fried rice stalls.  Economy rice: I got a plate of rice with 2 meat items and 2 vegetable items for $4.30, which is a price that's hard to match in town.  The ""rendang"" chicken was a generic curry sauce and didn't look or taste like rendang (which is closer to a dry paste coating the meat). There was a bit too much chicken skin but happily not too much potato - many places put a lot of potato in their curries to cut costs.  The curry pork was great, having a stronger spice blend and a thicker sauce which went well with pork, which is a somewhat heavier meat than chicken. Again there wasn't much potato which was good.  Large fried tofu cubes in a Thai-ish chili sauce was pretty tasty, though the tofu was a bit dry. Despite not being freshly fried it still retained some of its crunch, and the sauce was more complex than the usual ""Thai"" chili sauces which taste like they come from out of a bottle. The tofu cubes were also crinkly on the outside and firm on the inside (most places use a smoother type of tofu), and the texture was pleasing (most places do it very smooth).  The Chinese spinach with ikan bilis was alright - not overcooked as some do it though I've had better.  The curry sauce I opted to have spooned over my rice struck a good balance - it didn't overpower the taste of the other dishes, while adding welcome flavour to the plain rice.  This is definitely one of the better cai pngs (economy rice) I've had.  Fried rice: It was okay.  Ingredients wise it was quite generous, with small pieces of meat, crab stick, chinese sausage and even some small prawns generously scattered. There were even a few medium sized pieces of roast pork.  Sadly there wasn't enough wok hei (wok flavour) - maybe the fire isn't big enough."
Isle Eating House,,,,5,23-Sep-15,"What could possibly lead people to queue a swimming pool's length for econ rice?  Value is probably it. Not many places in the area - at least this side of the highway - allow you to eat for $2-4 and walk away full. Juices for $2 is 50% better than anybody else. $1 tea sure beats any other option in the area, including the Peace Centre food court.  The food is quite good for an econ rice stand. The CKT had decent wok hei and more importantly bits of Chinese sausage unfortunately missing from many other food courts' versions. Mee goreng and mee rebus seemed to be particularly popular, but econ rice is the star of this tiny food court.  Despite the massive queue at lunchtime, seating is relatively easy. Unlike, say, Food Republic at PS after its renovation (more space, less chairs, much chope).  One day this mall is going to get ""renovated"" and it will be back to overpaying for claypot chicken and BKT, but for now I'm enjoying it weekly."
Eat 3 Bowls,4,1,Taiwanese,4,23-Jun-22,The Taiwanese chicken rice is really good and much more different from what you would have tried. The service was quick as well. So I enjoyed my time there.
Chef Kang's Noodle House,5,3,Noodles,5,14-Jan-20,"This wanton mee inspires me to dabble in noodles.  Amazing char siew, perfect al dente noodles. The only drawback was that the sauces aren't as complementary and felt awkward. The char siew is charred right - do let them know if you prefer fatty or leaner meat (I prefer fatty)  The soup broth is rich and amazing. However, I do feel msg in it. If you are in Singapore go try it!!!"
Chef Kang's Noodle House,5,3,Noodles,5,7-Aug-21,Hidden in a commercial building canteen but the Wantan noodle and char Siew are excellent!
Chef Kang's Noodle House,5,3,Noodles,5,13-Apr-19,A cut above the rest. For one the soup!! Obviously the Chef has got knowledge on soup so it is the milky kind not one of those clear soup. The Wonton OMG - fresh shrimp and succulent. The noodle is wee bit al dente but works with a rather charred cha siew. All in all a happy foodie for a Saturday morning. Time for coffee!!
Zazz Pizza,4.8,6,"Pizza, Italian",4,23-Jul-22,"Quite disappointed as we took 15 min taxi expecting a five star experience as it was rated. The food is just soso, not as fresh. The biggest eye-catching point is the the real fire oven. Pizza is ok in flavor, ingredients and combination is a bit unusual. I can see the intention to create a SEA + Italian fusion. Sorry, there needs to be more flavor sensitivity and depth to the culinary skills."
Zazz Pizza,4.8,6,"Pizza, Italian",5,18-Apr-20,This is the best pizza place in SG. No doubt about it.  My daughter grew up on cheese pizza since kindergarten and she gives Zazz pizza a perfect 10.  Their delivery service is excellent and the food taste as good as it was in the restaurant.  Highly recommend the pasta and salad.  I miss having a beer and pizza there!
Zazz Pizza,4.8,6,"Pizza, Italian",5,18-Oct-19,"Visiting from The States and had to have some pizza. Wood fire baked pizza with a very large menu over fifty pages of pasta, bruschetta, pizza and other things. Tried the meat lovers which was great. Toppings were good crust was nice and crispy. Also had the Crab pizza which was described as very well done. Slightly undercooked center but it did have an egg in the center which might have added to that. And also for tourist they have free WiFi which is nice and they are very friendly and helpful."
Zazz Pizza,4.8,6,"Pizza, Italian",5,6-Feb-19,"Great pizza coming out of a wood fired oven. Nicely air conditioned too! We had a Quattro Stagioni and it was great. Keen to come back and try their desserts. Quick service, immaculate cutlery, friendly staff."
Zazz Pizza,4.8,6,"Pizza, Italian",5,24-Dec-19,"We are from the US and have eaten a lot of pizza, both at home and abroad. This pizza is absolutely outstanding -- the sauce, the cheese, and the crust. It's a small, unassuming place with only a few tables inside and many more outside. The staff was very friendly. We highly recommend it!"
Zazz Pizza,4.8,6,"Pizza, Italian",5,8-Aug-19,"I'm from New York and I have had my fair share of pizza and can say that this pizza is really good. Cooked in a brick oven with fresh ingredients, fresh dough with many different types of pizzas to choose from. I got the ribeye one and it was halal too, meat was freshly cooked and cooked well. Customer service was very good. Will probably come back here before I head back to the US. Oh, and the owner helped with paying for parking when I was there that's another plus. Overall I'm happy with my experience."
Haikee Brothers,5,1,Singaporean,5,19-Nov-18,"You need to try the signature soy chicken dishes. The soy chicken is tender and tasty. You have to try with either noodle or rice. I loved the soy sauce lor Mee as you can see from the photos! Very tasty dish, not dry but enough sauce to coat the noodles served with crispy roast pork ! The Haikee Brother meal deal is value for money as you get two serves of the soy chicken and rice, share a soup and two drinks. The century egg congee with bbq char siew was generous with the century egg. A huge bowl for sharing with others. A great place for a meal, reasonable in price."
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",4,16-Dec-23,We stumbled upon this xiao long bao stall in the Chinatown complex hawker center and had to grab a set after seeing a decent sized line waiting to order. The service is fast and line moves quickly so before we knew it we got our order of 5 xlbs. They were full of soup and piping hot. The soup was great - I just wish it was a tad bit sweeter for my liking but I was definitely impressed by the quality for a hawker stall.
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,7-Jun-24,"There was a sizable line waiting to place an order when we happened along this xiao long bao stand in the Chinatown complex hawker area, so we had to get a set. Our order of five pounds arrived before we realized it since the line moves rapidly and the service is quick. They were steaming hot and stuffed with soup. Although I would have preferred it to be somewhat sweeter, the soup was excellent and what you think about this thing special https://buyozempiconlinemexico.org/product/ozempic-semaglutide/"
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,29-Jan-23,"I was kind of skeptical but after seeing the really long line, we all knew we had to try at least one soup dumpling. For one order, you get 5 XLBs for a little less than $6 USD, which is considerably cheaper than Din Tai Fung back home. Orders come with a sauce cup with black vinegar and ginger, a staple with XLBs.  The skin was thin, cooked perfectly, and every bite had a burst of savory soup. Each order is really meant for one person just because of the odd amount of dumplings. But if you share with someone, you'll definitely have room to try other stalls. We also tried their chili oil wontons and they were spicier than what I'm used to.  Long lines usually mean good food and Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao didn't disappoint! Have one person wait in line with everyone's order while the rest look for tables or get more food. And don't forget to bus your own table!"
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,8-Feb-23,"We had to try this place during our trip because who doesn't love XLB? Luckily since we had a big group, we were able to split up to grab food for each other from different stalls to cut down on time spent waiting in lines. The line for this place must have been poppin because I feel like our friend who waited in this line for us was gone for at least half an hour!  The skins were the perfect thickness to avoid overwhelming the texture but also prevent any ripping when picked up. Each XLB had just the right amount of soup and was delicious when paired with the usual vinegar and ginger as a dipping sauce.  Well worth the wait for any fellow XLB lovers!"
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,1-Jul-22,"The best xiao long bao I've ever had! Hawker is located inside the Chaintown complex.  Expect to wait 10-20min in line to get your food, but then it comes out immediately! The family who owns it is very sweet, and you can tell they're one of the most popular in the complex.  Order the xiao long bao and sezchuan wontons for sure!! Put some ginger and vinegar in the sauce dish and you're ready to go."
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,29-Jan-23,Had xiao long bao and it was prepared well. I loved the pickled ginger that they have.
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,27-Jan-24,Dim Sum and dim sum more! Divine soup dumpling in authentic atmosphere. A must visit whilst in Singapore.
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",4,14-Dec-19,"I walked into the Smith Street Chinatown food court fully expecting the highlight to be the globally acclaimed Hawker Chan, so you can imagine my surprise when I found they were bested by neighbor Zhong Guo La Mian and their Spicy Wontons.  Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  Like Hawker Chan, there's almost always a line in front of Zhong Guo La Mian, but I was pleased to find on a Saturday lunch hour that the wait was less than twenty minutes. Once you're up front, your order comes out in no more than five minutes. Star.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  $5 SGD for ten Spicy Szechuan Wontons might have felt a bit more expensive than some of the other stalls, but this was at the end of the day a screaming deal given these are made fresh to order essentially right in front of you. Star.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  These spicy wontons were excellent, and my only regret was that I didn't also order the XLB. You had great filler encased in a smooth skin that really lapped up the spicy chili oil. Single Star.  Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?  Definitely. Star."

Lets get real, these are at best decent XLB for a hawker stall, but even trying to compare these to DTF is absolute fake news. The non-XLB items are completely mediocre (read: ugh). Pass."
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,3-Mar-15,"Kreta Ayer market is just a labyrinth on the second floor, chocked full of food gems to be discovered. One such example, Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao.  As in the namesake, you should get an order of the xiao long baos. At 10 for $5, they're a good deal, and while a little less refined than the ones from Din Tai Fung, these feel more homely and very satisfying. The soup dumplings are really juicy and the broth has good flavor.  They often make the dumplings to order so there might a be a little wait as they prepare the dumplings and place them right into the steamer. It's totally worth it though."
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",4,23-Jul-17,In terms of hawker xlb this would be one of the good ones. I still think the soup should be more oily and sticky. The skin is correct. I suppose so far din tai fung will be the most authentic although a bit " too clean" in flavor. For the price I think you get your money's worth. 6 for 10.
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,23-May-13,"I cheer for the underdogs. Well, 99% of the time...only because 1% seriously should stay that way.  I typically spit at the favored ones. Well, nearly 99% of the time because they tend to get over-hyped to the point that making small mistakes become so unforgivable. After all, the endless banter causes your brain to think they are PERFECT because of how they are marketed right?  This probably explains my utter distaste towards Din Tai Feng (especially the two overcrowded spots in LA that supposedly has the best dumplings in the freaking area). Don't get me wrong, they are decent. Quite good at best...but nothing mind-blowing. So when people keep saying that Din Tai Feng is the ONLY to-go spot for GOOD dumplings...bile begins to form in my mouth.  Fast-forward to Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao...you'll find two very friendly and hardworking PRCs (wanted to say Chinese guys but changed it PRC to purposely address the current stereotype and say these guys are freaking AWESOME; they should be culinary ambassadors) kneading dough and forming Xiao Long Baos (hereafter, XLBs) one after the other with their magical fingers. They don't even need to boast awesomeness and screw themselves up with a swollen reputation because witnessing them furiously at work to keep up with the line is enough indication that they ARE.  Now one of two main reasons for visiting Chinatown Complex (the other being the Good Beer Company) and having their XLB on several occasions after Cindy Q. introduced it to our little gathering, I can safely say that $5 for 10 XLBs that taste great and pairs well with strong beers...is ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!""  /Definitely-recommend  NOTE: I've had it 5 times so far (20-30 each time) and the best time is usually dinner after a long line. Why? I went at lunch and my 20 XLBs came from the chiller and the dough was a bit dry and chewy compared to the ones I've had during dinner where it goes straight to the steamer freshly made.  Yelp 100: 36/100"
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,24-May-16,Xiao Long Bao in my opinion better than Din Tai Fung and cheaper. 10 for $5.50. The xlb are tasty and soupy. Made fresh in front of you and served steaming hot :) I appreciate the simplicity of the ingredients yet the complexity of the flavors. Such a simple dish but so tasty. I'll definitely be back.  Others were also ordering the Szechuan dumplings or wonton which looked really good too.
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",4,28-Feb-17,"Wildly delicious and exceptionally convenient - XLBs will be the end of me.  I will move into the Chinatown Complex and find refuge with Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao.  There is something uniquely satisfying about eating dumplings prepared before your eyes. It's nostalgic....a taste of innocence. One bite and they'll have you. They'll own your time and your wallet.  While I am reluctant to admit this kind of uncouth behavior, I can devour 30 dumplings in one sitting! ;-)"
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",4,12-Mar-17,"All-in-all, Din Tai Fung still wins in my opinion, as I prefer the flavor of the DTF xiao long bao filling. The skin here was somewhat inconsistent, and if you weren't very delicate and careful, it would break, letting the soup leak out. Everything is clearly handmade fresh here though; you can see them hard at work in the hawker stall kitchen, making each dumpling one by one and steaming the baskets. Of course these are not as aesthetically pleasing as DTF, but if you're looking for soupy dumplings at an affordable price then this is the place for you.  We also ordered one bowl of beef noodle soup, one plate of pan-fried dumpling, one plate of boiled dumplings, and one plate of szechuan spicy wonton. For a group of six, the total was just S$7pp! The beef noodle soup was very delicious, and I'd definitely order that on its own again. The pan-fried and boiled dumplings were excellent as well. The pan-fried is probably more unique and requires more effort to cook (also more unhealthy). The szechuan wonton is a unique flavor of vinegar and spicy oil, and it's not for everyone. It might be an acquired taste, but none of us foreigners were really a big fan of the szechuan spiciness with vinegar."
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",4,26-Dec-15,"It's not bad. But I dont think it's gonna win any awards soon. I ordered the szechuan spicy noodles and pan fried dumplings.  You cant order half portion for the dumplings. So it's all or nothing. The dumplings are good, but I've had better. But for hawker centre standards.. 7/10.  The noodles has a peanut sauce base, but it was lacking in dimensions. About 6/10 not a big fan, but it was decent.  I was just too lazy to queue for the other award winning stalls.... I'll come back to try their xiao long bao next time"
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,16-Jul-17,Best XLB in #Singapore is found at Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao in Chinatown. #1 the steamed mini buns... basically pork dumplings but the fat from pork melts out of the meat into the bun and is kinda soupy in the buns... OH MY GOD! So good!!!!!!! #illeatforyou #XLB
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,31-May-17,"The only place I've ever tried XLB was at Din Tai Fung in Seattle. Even though others love it, I never thought it was that good and just assumed XLB was supposed to be that way. My views on XLB changed after going to Zhong Guo La Mian. For about $4.50 USD you get 10 amazingly juicy and perfectly steamed XLB that packs so much amazing flavor that you'll crave for months. If I can find a way back to Singapore, this spot is a must stop."
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",4,2-Jan-16,"This place does different types of dumplings and some noodles as well. I sampled the dumplings and they are pretty decent, not that they are amazing in any way but the pan-fried dumplings are good and 10 for 5.5 SGD is a good deal.  The line was not long when I was there but there was a constant flow of people going here and for the price it would be a place I could consider returning to."
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,18-Apr-13,"$5 for 10, whether it be xiao long bao, guo tie, boiled dumplings or steamed ones.  I was meeting Jireh H and Amanda L for a drink at Good Beer Company. I was early and craving dumplings, decided to walkabout to survey the offerings. Started seeing many tables had big bamboo steamers on them. Finally found the dumpling shop run by 2 cheery China guys.  I started with an order of boiled dumplings. Once the others took a taste, they started really getting into it. We ended up ordering a few more lots of xiao long baos and an order of guo tie.  The xiao long bao has a certain sweetness to it, I think it's Chinese wine. These and the pot stickers (guo tie) seemed to be the most popular ones when we were waiting for our orders. I prefer the xiao long bao and boiled dumplings to the pot stickers as I find the stickers a bit heavy because of the oil from frying. The dumplings are already quite resplendent with meat juices inside. People were ordering dumplings to takeaway in multiple boxes.  I give 5 stars not because these are the best I've ever had but they are very yummy with a bit of a unique taste and well worth the price. There's also not much of a wait despite them being made up on the spot. You can see the guys rolling the dough and filling them while waiting..free entertainment!"
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",4,31-Jul-16,"Good, solid xlb that can satisfy any craving with the additional delight of having paid just $5.50 for 10 dumplings!! Found this on Yelp and no regrets about trying it.  I'm a huge xlb fan - used to go to the crystal jade steamboat and xlb buffet for both the steamboat AND the free flow xlb! & I've just returned from Taipei where I tried the original Din Tai Fung.  My conclusion: this is comparable with DTF quality xlb in Singapore, for a better price point. The skin is paper-thin without being overly soft or breakable, and the soup folded inside the dumplings is tasty and steaming hot. We thought that the filling is more generous than DTF or other places in general (and the dumpling are similar sized), and similar-tasting. The dumplings are also made-to-order, which means you have to line up for a longer time as you wait for it to steam (or pan fry if you order guo tie) but so very worth it.  Obviously it's in a hawker center so the atmosphere is nothing special to speak of, but it's great for a no-frills meal. It makes me sad to think that something so simple and so good and so cheap can't be found easily in the US :(  P.S I gotta try this Good Beer Company everyone's mentioning :p  P.P.S. The store is #02-135 for those struggling to find it as I did: it's near the edge of the complex! And across from Hong Kong Soy Sauce Chicken store of Michelin fame."
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",4,24-Jan-16,"I have eaten at this establishment a few times now and usually I just walk up to the counter and order a batch of freshly made xiao long baos, but today was a good 10 minutes wait. Not that I'm complaining, it was totally worth it! The wait actually allowed me to watch how the guy makes his tasty little packets of love. So I'm not a big fan of xlb that are very soupy - I know, I know, don't lynch me! - it's just my preference (and don't get me started on those tang baos). But don't get me wrong, the meat filling isn't dry by any means. I find them to be full of balanced flavor between pork and flour skin. For a little variety try them in different combination of sauces (soy or vinegar only, and mixed) and with/without ginger. Try with ketchup ... ok, just kidding. The other nice thing is the reasonable price of $5.50/10 pieces, come on. Great taste for a great price, go give this place a try."

The second time we came at 515pm and they were open for business. I ordered the XLB and spicy pork dumplings. Both were super delicious. The couple owners were so nice and helpful too. They made me feel very welcomed at their food stand."
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,14-Jan-16,"Thank you Yelp for helping me find this place, as trying to locate a stall inside the overwhelming Chinatown Complex hawker center can be a daunting task. This place does not disappoint. I had 10 steamed XLB which costed me $5.50 SGD ($3.82 USD). As I slurped each of the delicate and succulent XLBs, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the broth has a sweet umami flavor. The skin was tender but strong enough to keep all the fillings in without breaking when I picked up the XLBs with my chopsticks. Many reviewers have compared this place's dumpling to DTF - an unfair comparison given that DTF is a huge global franchise. In my opinion, this place is way better than DTF. I would not hesitate to come back again and again."
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",1,14-Sep-17,"Ya, if they were open.... so disappointing that I had to settle for Hawker Chan but it should be a good alternative.... yelp didn't show that this is closed though.....hope to try it again soon but for now is 1 star..."

We went to Chinatown complex looking for the Good Beer Company but since it was dinner time thought it would be great to get some food too especially because we were in a gigantic food court.  After walking around the food court for 10 mins, I found this little shop selling xiao long bao. The couple at the shop were hand making them as you order. They were selling them at 10 XLBs for 5.50 Singaporean dollars (incredible!) I ordered 10 to share with the hubby, we finish them in 2 mins and went back to get 20 more!  They were delicious and much cheaper than restaurants like Din Tai Fung...etc.  Totally recommend going there if traveling in Singapore!"

The dumplings were fresh (they actually make them in front of you), juicy and the skin wrapper was delicate and thin. These were better than any that I've had at Din Tai Fung or any other soup dumpling restaurant, and it was only $6 for 10. Definitely worth checking out while you're in Chinatown."
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,7-Oct-12,"$5 for 10 awesome xiao long bao!  One lunch my colleagues and I descended on the stall like a horde of locusts ordering over a 100 of the xiao long bao along with wontons, pan fried dumplings and la mian. Every dish was tasty and consistent in quality.  While the xiao long bao may not be as thin skinned as ""the best"" restaurant dumplings, they are my favorite on this island especially given their incredible value for money."

Only $4.50 for 10. The xiao long bao are great, but you HAVE to try the potstickers. They take a little longer to fry up, but definitely worth the wait. The spicy dumplings are a close second. The hawkers are really friendly and never turn anyone away when they are trying to close. (Although once the sign goes off you'll only get xiao long bao.) I've noticed that there are a lot more fellow ang moh in the queue with me lately. Probably no coincidence that so many reviews start with ""I was going to Good Beer Company and..."""
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,13-Aug-17,"Best Xiao Long Bao I've ever had by a good margin. More homestyle than Din Tai Fung, the dumpling skins were slightly softer and more glutinous, and the soup was very flavorful. The pan fried dumplings and Shanghai spicy noodles were also fantastic. An excellent meal for two for $14 SGD. Pair with some Tiger beer for an over the moon street food experience. Loved it, loved it, loved it!!!!"
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",4,7-Jan-14,"The xiaolong baos were better than I would have thought.

I have to try the potstickers next time! :)"
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",5,21-Mar-15,"Best XLBs in all of Singapore. Don't waste your money anywhere else, especially not Din Tan Fung.

Still unbelievable how they haven't changed their prices in two years and how you still only wait 5 minutes for 40 XLBs!"
Zhong Guo La Mian Xiao Long Bao,4.5,37,"Shanghainese, Dim Sum, Noodles",4,14-Jun-14,Went for dinner and found this stand on the second floor of the Chinatown complex. I was on a mission to find this stall along with the Good Beer Company and it was a sucess. I ordered 10 "steamed mini buns" for $5.50 and the uncle there was busy hand making them. Mine were premade as they were not busy when I stopped by so they already had some waiting but they did taste very fresh. I ate them both with and without the ginger vinegar dip and actually preferred them without the vinegar. They were already very juicy!
Taste Of Morroco,5,1,Moroccan,5,4-Dec-12,"Morroco rotisserie spring chicken is excellent. A one man run stall, most of the time no proper fork and knife, had to use plastic ones. Open late at night, so was a good protein supper."

Everest Kitchen,4,7,"Himalayan/Nepalese, Indian",4,2-Mar-17,This cute restaurant is a little off the main roads of little india but so worth a visit. Got there early and were the only guests there so we had a little chitchat with the owner of the place - super nice guy. Food was delicious. Minus one point for the mango lassie that had kind of a weird taste to it.
Everest Kitchen,4,7,"Himalayan/Nepalese, Indian",5,28-Jun-15,"Upgrading this to 5 star because for S$6.80 for a thali that has a daal, vegetable and a chicken curry, basmati rice, yoghurt is really a steal. Their appetizers with beer are really nice and the free flow of papadum with green chutney is a good gesture from them. Good momos with a nice red sauce.  Can be very crowded on Sunday afternoons and probably need a reservation on friday and saturday dinners."
Everest Kitchen,4,7,"Himalayan/Nepalese, Indian",4,17-Jun-15,Very friendly service.. Simple menu. Good Thali and good momos and sauce. The chilli chicken and beer for starters is good. Still cheap and the CHEAPEST THALI in Little India.
Everest Kitchen,4,7,"Himalayan/Nepalese, Indian",5,12-Sep-14,"Food here were awesome. Full of test and aromas. I liked the Nepali thali, Momos, papaya shrimps and alot. Service was fast and helpful. I recommend this place.... if i visit Singapore then will be going to this place for lunch and dinner."
Everest Kitchen,4,7,"Himalayan/Nepalese, Indian",3,30-Jul-19,Recommended place to have good panner snacks and vegetarian momos. Probably one of the few restaurants in Singapore to server authentic Momos. Service is good. Need to increase types of draft beer as the choice currently is very limited. Overall an average place to enjoy drinks and a very nice one to enjoy momos
Everest Kitchen,4,7,"Himalayan/Nepalese, Indian",5,18-Jul-12,"The best Nepali restaurant in Singapore as far as i'm concerned. This place has it all worked out. Great food, charming ambience and friendly people. Waiting for dishes is not too bad. However the dishes are really solid. The palak paneer is amazing. The veg chowmin is a super yummy noodles that serves 2 people easily for just $5. This is the kind of place you go to with a few friends or the family and order a couple of dishes that should be shared. They even have a really interesting coffee called the Mustang coffee that has a little bit of rum in it. This place along with apollo are my favorite 2 places in little india."
Everest Kitchen,4,7,"Himalayan/Nepalese, Indian",5,12-Oct-16,"What an excellent gem! We found this place strolling from the MRT and were pleasantly surprised! We had the chicken tandoori, palak paneer, and dalal makhli and all were so delicious! The owners were very friendly and made us feel nice and cozy! We'll be back for sure!"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,18-May-23,"It must have been in the past decade that they have moved from originally from novena. I'd rank Wee Name Kee as my 2nd top go to place for chicken rice. If you like chicken rice that is richer in soy sauce, this is it! The service was a little meh (slightly grumpy granny) as the lady who served us was a little impatient, though it wasn't busy. As I waited for my friend to finish her call... I felt her death stare and routine check in despite my friend still being on the phone that I eventually made an executive decision to just order but all is well, no harm done (no except the chicken who was sacrificed :P ). The ""new"" location is definitely more convenient to go to as it's located in a mall with connection to the underground metro."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,1-Jul-22,"Came by for lunch the other day and it was a tasty experience. Wee Nam Kee is a restaurant with A/C and waiter service.  Ordered the roast chicken combo with dumplings and vegetables, oyster sauce vegetables, along with a rice and iced tea.  Service by the restaurant was prompt from order taking to fulfillment of the order, all within a few minutes!  Started off with the dumplings and vegetables in broth and these were tasty. The dumplings had plenty of meat and vegetables inside. The broth was flavorful and the vegetables were fresh.  The side of vegetables with oyster sauce was also tasty. Portions were more than sufficient for lunch!  The rice was fragrant rice and very tasty.  The roast chicken drumstick came out on the cooler side. Previous visit's chicken tasted even better!  There is a 5% service charge on top of 7% GST. Prices are higher in the interim due to supply chain challenges."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,6-Apr-19,"Came by for dinner the other night and it was a tasty experience. Thank you to Yelper Nik T. For all the fantastic photos and review! Located in the Novena area, the restaurant itself features Air conditioning.  The trickiest part is the service is rather mediocre...  Started off with the daily soup and it was a soothing and refreshing way to start off dinner after a long day of traveling.  The Kang Kong Belanchan was excellent with strong flavors and young vegetables! Portions were small, which was perfect!  The 1/2 Roast chicken was the highlight of the meal, with fresh chicken, roasted perfectly and super juicy. The ginger onion dipping sauce was delightful too!  The noodles were a nice way to complement the meal too!  $16/head after tax and 10% service charge."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,30-Dec-22,"Fast service for a party of 7 on for lunchtime on Friday. The Hainanese chicken rice was the star of the show, at first bite it was tender but still juicy. Side condiments of chili paste, ground fresh ginger and sweet soy sauce was the perfect addition to drizzle on top. The fried shrimp balls came second and had an interesting honey(?) sauce dip which made it almost taste like desert. Mix Hor Fan had a delicious smoky wok char to the flat rice noodles and it came with a decent amount of seafood and pork. Lastly, Sambal Kang kong was a refreshing vegetable to pair with the chicken, but also had a deep chili bean paste taste to it. Overall a family friendly lunch spot with great service and decent prices, total came out to 105S$. The only thing I noticed was they didn't offer napkins, had to ask up front and even then we were offered a few."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,4-Dec-23,"Roast chicken, good. Chicken rice, good. Vegetables, good. Seasoning tray on the table, excellent. Chicken broth, good. Price, good. $2 Coke lite, goooooooooood."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,20-Feb-23,This was one of the restaurants on our to go list for our trip and it did not disappoint! We ended up ordering it for take out but it was packed very efficiently and the flavors were legit. We ordered a half of hainanese poached chicken with rice and a side of veggies. Everything was still warm and fresh. Plenty for our family of 4 & reasonably priced. Highly recommend! One of the best meals of the trip.
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,15-Jul-23,Came here for chicken and rice! Rice has flavor infused. You can add soy sauce that is very thick but also very sweet so don't add too much too quick. There is a white salty chicken and dark soy sauce chicken option. Both are great but I prefer the white chicken. We also got the sizzling bean curd which is healthy but taste great because of the sauce it is cooked with. We have to take the bill to the front to pay rather than pay at the table
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,8-Jul-23,It's good chicken rice. I promise. Good service too. That's all I have to say. And good side dishes.
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,13-Aug-20,"Wee nam Kee chicken rice pretz for $1.60 a box!!! You can get them here or at NTUC. The chicken rice here is always good, consistency is true here. Generally I get a bowl of wanton soup to go along with the chicken rice as well!"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",2,24-Oct-20,Restaurant had only customers at three tables yet services were slow and inattentive. Ordered a set of chicken meat with rice and soup but the soup did not come. Had to remind the waitress when I had almost finished my food. The food is good but the restaurant services need to innovate and improve. I do not think I am motivated to visit the restaurant again in the near future.
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,2-Feb-19,"I would come back here every week if I can afford roundtrip airfare is from the US to here. Lol :)  It's a good indoor space with AC to have a nice and quick lunch or dinner if you are in town and think outside is too hot or humid.  Salt and Pepper Crab Great flavor to the pepper sauce. I've had this dish three times in Singapore and their sauce is possibly the best. Word of caution- this is a messy dish. There is no good way to eat this- your fingers are going to get dirty and sticky so just dive in and take care of business. The quality of the crab was three star- it felt a little undersized given the price paid. I'll give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt because it's late in crab season and I've been spoiled by the Dungeness living in San Francisco.  Salty Egg Prawn with Golden Mini Bun OMG this is so delicious. A bit sweet and tiny salty, it's perfect sauce for the mini-bun  Hai-nun White Chicken & Rice My all-time favorite, Singapore classic dish. You can use garlic and spicy sauce from the table. There are many famous rice & chicken restaurants in Singapore, but this is definitely one of the best!!  Green vegetables stir-fried with shrimp paste, it's a bit salty, but it tastes really good with rice  Beef her-fen, very tender beef with white width rice flat noodles. If you like rice flat noodles ºÓ·Û and beef. You will definitely like it.  There are few boba milk tea (black sugar caramel is my favorite) and dessert place that is right outside of the restaurant. Good way to end the meal for sure."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,11-Jul-22,"Tasty chicken rice and more ! white chicken is good roasted meats are good price is fair! wife love this place , location also good!"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,1-Aug-16,"If my latest check-in says I've been here 15x, then I have to give this place 5 Stars. I'm no chicken rice expert although I've eaten my fair share of them in my few months here in SG. The reason I keep returning to WNK as my favorite chxn rice place is simply because it is so delicious. The roast chicken is my favorite because of the nice skin and tender meat pieces. I also prefer that my ginger and chili pastes are separated in separate containers like it is here. I like to make my own concoction.  WNK is a well established restaurant and clientele will continue to flock here for their Hainanese dishes. I was amazed to find out that the founder of WNK doesn't even cook at all. Great story, great food."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,24-Oct-17,"Hainanese chicken rice is a national dish and one of those things you have to have when you visit Singapore. One spot consistently appears on all of the major lists and reviews to find it: Wee Nam Kee. Don't let its multiple locations make it appear like a ""chain"" and touristy, it is serving up some pretty damn good bites and worth a visit.  While I'm no expert on another countries national dish, it was pretty good in my book and I'd go back for more. The chicken was beautifully cooked and the meat moist through it all and its simple flavors were quickly brought out by the fragrant rice filled with ginger and spice from garlic. Add the soy or chili flavored sauces on the side to your liking and your set.  The roast meats that you can order weren't too shabby and the saut¨¦ed vegetables were pretty delicious (but not worth a 14 hour flight for).  Service is quick and efficient, while the line does add a bit of a wait time, it moves at a decent pace. Prices are pretty reasonable so you could enjoy a few dishes to share. The ambiance is simple and loud, so probably not the best for that high-level dinner meeting or that romantic special evening.  In a city filled with so many options, would I go back? Heck yeah..it was pretty good and I know I won't be disappointed."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,8-Jun-18,"The best chicken rice I've ever had in my entire life. Go with the steamed chicken, although the roast chicken comes quite close. Also, get the kangkung with some sort of balachan sauce as your veggies. The salted egg yolk ribs are also bomb!!!"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",3,8-May-18,The roast pork didn't taste super fresh and the char siu skin wasn't that crispy. The hainanese chicken was fairly standard and the shark fin soup was okay.
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,25-Oct-19,"I love chicken rice and this chain just does it so well. This location in particular keeps things moving despite being deluged with many customers who, like myself, want some delicious Hainanese chicken rice and the accoutrements that go along with it. :-)"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,13-Mar-17,"My friend took me to try to famous chicken rice near her office. We got there early before the lunch time rush. Definitely a good call to go early since she was in a rush to return to work. The line started to form after noon but we were seated slightly before the rush.  Keep in mind that they leave wet naps on the table which will be added to the bill if you use them. The chicken rice was amazing and it came with soup on the side. We also ordered some veggies, BBQ pork and roasted pork. The chicken was the highlight of the meal and the prices were reasonable.  The pork was not outstanding since I have had better elsewhere. The portions were average but it is great that you are not stuffed by the end of the meal. Service was similar to a food court as they moved from one into their own location. I do crave the tender chicken and will come back if I have the chance to return to Singapore."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,17-Sep-14,"I love the roast chicken here (juicy meat and crispy skin) and its condiments (chili, ginger and dark soy sauce). The soup is tasty, none of those watered down liquid other places called it as soup. The rice could be better but is good enough for me especially when you put everything together in one mouthful. It blends beautifully without distractions.  The dumpling was not bad but not the star. I would have to try the noodle version as recommended by the king of Singapore aka Nik T some day.  The place is very noisy and if you are prone to headache, you may want to get it to go instead. The service is very brusque and efficient and one does not really linger over the meal."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,4-Aug-18,"Get the white chicken version, that's their speciality. The sambal version gang kung is good side dish. I would skip the fried dish"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,2-Jun-18,"I love this restaurant. The hainan chicken rice is so good. I ordered the soya sauce, roast, steamed chicken, bbq pork, and roast pork..taste really good..the oyster sauce vegetables is also good.  CONCLUSION = RECOMMENDED!!"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,18-Jan-19,"Singapore's national dish is Hainanese Chicken Rice and one of those things you have to have when you visit Singapore. Business lunch and wanted local food, so Wee Nam Kee it was - and I was quite happy. The consistent good reviews are for a very good reason - the food is good, you get a lot and service is great. I recommend the boiled white chicken.  The chicken was expertly cooked and the meat moist with a simple flavor that is enhanced by the fragrant rice that has ginger and garlic. Mix the ginger, soy or chili flavored sauces that are on the table for different flavors."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,5-Nov-16,"Singapore is a culinary paradise, and Hainanese Chicken Rice is one of its gems. If you have ever come across the CNN Go World's 50 most delicious food, you'll see this traditional dish stands confidently at number 45. Thus, there's no reason to skip it while we were in Singapore. Wee Nam Kee Hainanese Chicken Rice restaurant was our pick. The place is located on Thomson Road in the Novena area. We've heard many good stories about this place, and the experience turned out to be great.  When it comes to chicken rice in Singapore, steamed and roasted chickens are among the top. At Wee Nam Kee, the chicken is super tender and lean. It was cooked beautifully, so delicious that you can taste the moist and juicy meat on your first bite! Don't forget to make yourself the perfect dipping sauce to have the greatest flavor experience. Combining chili sauce, ginger paste and low sodium dark soy sauce, you'll make up a perfect condiment to go with this dish. Eating companion is a bowl of fluffy rice, which boosts your appetite at an instant. More importantly, a meal for two will cost you anywhere from S$10 to S$16, which is a superb price tag!  Recommendation: Roasted and steamed chicken rice, soy sauce chicken rice  Read our Singapore Food Guide: http://www.thecoupleeats.com/singapore-food-diary-7-places-eat-first-time-visitors/"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",3,31-Oct-18,"I wonder why this place is so famous. The chicken is pretty good, but not the best Singapore can produce, and the rice is not very fragrant and just average. Other dishes we had (tofu, salted egg prawns, kang kong) were quite meh."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,23-Apr-16,"Per locals recommendation, it was definitely on the list of places to try Hainanese chicken rice. We were lucky and a table was just leaving when we arrived, so no long queue! I would say our meal was really good. The chicken is moist and flavorful and the rice is just as tasty. We ordered half a steamed chicken and extra sauce. Yum. Cereal prawns was also something we ordered that I've never tried before and I found it to be the balance of crunchy sweet and then savory. They made it pretty well. We also got some local veggies and a hot plate dish of veggies, shrimp, and tofu. Roast chicken was yummy too. Overall, I'd recommend wee nam kee and would come back to this location.  Tip: it gets busy, so get there early so you don't have to queue too long"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,21-Mar-17,"Delicious!!! This places was kind of hard to find.  I got the half chicken with all three flavors, steam, Soyo and roasted. Their ginger garlic and hot sauce was super duper bomb. Their chicken was moist and delicious.  MUST KNOW: they charge for napkins........ even the wet napkins they give you when you seat. They don't tell you... until you open it and they will automatically put it on your tab.. i felt like this was a scam. I never asked for wet napkins and they dare to charge? It was only 40cents, but considering their inconsiderate action kind of got me upset...  Other than that their food wasss good."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,14-Oct-17,"It was quite a long wait for the chicken and after trying it out, I would say it's pretty good, but not enough to blow me away. For anyone visiting Singapore, you must try the Hainan Chicken Rice. The fragrant rice is my favorite part (I ate 2 servings myself) and I am also a big fan of adding lots of dark soy sauce to the chicken. You should also order the sambal vegetables, which is amazing (I honestly thought the vegetables were more yummy than the chicken itself). To complete the meal, you should also order the soup of the day with it."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,7-Sep-13,"so just what goes into the sauce that drenches wee nam kee's noodles? is it just a simple combo of sweet yet savoury flavours that keeps me coming back for more?? or does it contain any extract similar to the secret recipe of coca-cola???  i have been hooked on coke for a good part of my life but am happy to say i'm coke free for a good 2 years plus now, ever since a life changing event that culminated in a switch to drinking alkaline water.  but ever since wee nam kee moved to it's new location at united square, which by the way is fully air conditioned, better organized but most importantly easier for me to get to, i have been hooked on the sauce that drenches their noodles!  it probably is this same sauce that they use to season their soya sauce chicken but my personal preference has and always will be their legendary crispy skin roast chicken. their technique has been perfected such that the crispy skin is indeed crispy whilst the integrity of the succulent flesh beneath is never compromised! a whole roast chicken is what i would order and devour. do pair that with the sauce that drenches a simple plate of al dente noodles, i would, instead of their rice. the rice from another kee, also near me, is better in my humble opinion.  alas, the said sauce that drenches their noodles will keep you asking for more noodles just so you can drink more sauce! sauce is it!  the only reason they do not get the fifth star is their poor service. it was the same back at novena ville and some things never change. not quite sure if they are short handed. not quite sure if they are poorly trained. you can wait for long periods after being seated, desperately waving but all in vain. is service with a smile really banned?  perhaps the best way for you to get your WNK fix is to order to go? no queuing, just walk up to the counter, order, pay and go. during peak hours, even more so.  a check on their website reveals delivery and catering also! hmmmm perhaps mr. wee himself will bring me the sauce that drenches the noodles?!"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,29-May-17,"Review for Nov2016 - very popular spot around the dinner hour, make sure to call ahead for reservations or get take out. Definitely super delicious and would come here multiple times!"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,6-Mar-17,"Died and gone to heaven. Best Chicken and Rice I've ever had! Roasted chicken dipped in chili and dark soy sauce, BBQ crispy pork, out of this world!"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,30-Jul-13,"Hands down the best Chicken Rice in Singapore!  As I said in my previous Wee Nam Kee review (for the old location), I like to get the quarter chicken + rice (instead of the standard plate of 'chicken rice') when I eat there for some extra chicken. Along with the Wanton Soup and Sambal Kang Kong... this combination makes for the perfect meal.  And if you've never had chicken rice before, the condiments MAKE the meal! Yes, all three - the chill sauce, ginger and the black sauce.  I know a lot of people like Tian Tian and all the other famous places as well but in my opinion, Chicken Rice really doesn't get much better than at Wee Nam Kee! This place does get crowded though - be prepared to fight for a seat during lunch / dinner rush hour.  Apart from their Chicken Rice, I die for the Salted Fish Fried Rice here too (not that you normally would think of ordering anything else - but everything else is surprisingly good too)!  Since they have moved to United Square, as expected, prices have definitely gone up. However, for the same great food + air-con? I'm not complaining! I'm just happy the food quality remained the same!"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,8-Aug-14,"If there were some alternate universe where all there was to eat was chicken rice, I think I'd be okay with that.  I mean, assuming that there were a number of different places to eat said chicken rice, I feel like the basic chicken/rice/broth combo could be varied enough with the additional sauces and condiments to create enough excitement in my mouth. And let's assume I could only eat chicken rice in Singapore forever and ever... it's safe to assume that I'd be here at Wee Nam Kee at least 3 out of 7 nights stuffing their delectable fowl in my mouth... either the steamed or the roasted variety, I wouldn't be all that fussy."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,20-May-19,2nd Greatest place in Singapore for roasted Hainan Chicken. The poached (steamed) & soya Hainan Chicken is below average. Very long wait time. Poor service from badly understaffed crew. Dumpling is horrendous. Tze Char here is bad.
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,24-Jan-17,"Chicken and rice makes life finger lickin nice. Wee Nam Kee is among my top Chicken and Rice places in Singapore, in part, because it's just a great gathering place for friends and family members, the service is quick and efficient, and importantly, the Chicken and rice (and sauce) are quite consistently good. The Chicken is tender and juicy; and the rice perfectly captures the Chicken juices."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,21-Sep-19,Food is good. Authentic Hainan chicken rice. Chinese staffs are way too lousy. They speak like there are no one around than staffs. While all customers are quite to eat. I love food here but I haven't learn to adapt with that noise.
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,14-Apr-19,"I went to their Katong i12 branch and I was blown away. Before Wee Nam Kee, I frequently visited another restaurant in the area. I didn't find their rice to my liking. But Wee Nam Kee has great rice as well as great chicken. I particularly like the roasted chicken and one of their tofu dish."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,11-Dec-17,"Really solid and good chicken rice, soup, boiled chicken, and roasted pork. Dining tip: add a bit of ginger to the soup. It'll give a bit more dimension to it"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,22-Jun-15,"My fav place to steamed chicken and YOU TIAO!!! To complete my meal I usually ordered hot barley drinks. You will not be able to go wrong with this combination =)) Cos this place is always packed, it would be easier to come in small groups. Even when you come in a small group (2 or 3 people), be prepared to share a table with strangers. This place is really popular among locals."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,22-May-16,Our favourite chicken rice - they are pretty good for take out as well. The rice is very fragrant and the chicken is very tender and tasty. I especially like the roasted chicken. We would also typically get the 'Tou Miao' to go with the meal. I have to say the chili sauce and the ginger is what makes this a great plate of food.
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,7-Sep-15,"I used to not like chicken rice until I met and married a Singaporean :p  This is one of my favorite chicken rice places in Singapore, and I would highly recommend getting the roast chicken if they have it, and a side of vegetable. I would also recommend eating it. If you take away, they will often forget your vegetable dish or side dish, or whatever you ordered, because it's happened to my mother in law and brother in law numerous times. IF you do takeaway, they usually rush you because it's so busy, but I would make sure you check all the food items in your bag to make sure they don't ""forget"" to give you all your food."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,5-Jan-15,"Who knew such a simple dish as Chicken Rice could be so good! And you know what, very few, if any, do it better than Wee Nam Kee. Wee Nam's Chicken Rice comes in two distinct forms: Steamed or Roasted. Wee Nam's speciality is undoubtedly the ""Roasted"" Chicken Rice. I prefer dark meat, so I usually order the Drumstick Rice. Regardless of your order, whether the regular chicken rice or drumstick rice, you are in for a treat.  The roasted chicken rice delivers a crunchy skin, but yet is soo juicy on the inside. The flavours of the chicken just seem to secrete out of the skin. These chicken flavours are so good that I don't even bother to use Chilli sauce or the sweetish dark sauce that normally accompanies Singapore Chicken Rice dishes. The cilantro sprinkled on top is just heavenly.  I've tried three Wee Nam Kee locations and the one in United Square is clearly the best. I'm not sure if it's the original, but it's just that much better. Service is suspect, but then again, one doesn't go to Wee Nam for the service, but rather for the food. Fair Warning: any dish outside of chicken rice could take a while to serve.  The Bottom Line: Wee Nam delivers a killer Roasted Chicken Rice. If you prefer steamed Chicken Rice, Tian Tian still reigns supreme in my book. The United Square Branch is The Crown Jewel of the Wee Nam Kee franchise!"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,8-Apr-17,Definitely get here before 12 and you'll find a seat. When lunch time hits there will be a wait. I ordered the white (boiled) chicken rice and my sister got the dumpling soup and dry noodles. The chicken rice was good (although my favorite will always be boon tong kee) but the dumpling and noodles was surprisingly delicious.
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,24-Jul-15,"Oh my goodness, Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice restaurant is a solid four stars! First, let me say, this place is always packed (a very good sign) so get there early or prepare to wait.  Lucky for us, we got to the restaurant before the crazy dinner rush and were quickly shown to a table. Ten minutes later there were no open tables.  Upon seating us in the air conditioned dining room, the waitress brought water, then started us off with an amazing broth. Good thing because both of us were starved. We slurped it down pretty fast and to our amazement she came over and refilled our bowls. Very cool.  Since it was just two of us, we kept it simple. We ordered, of course, the chicken rice. But the baked version. It was perfectly prepared. Moist on the inside, crispy skin on top plus a large helping of lightly flavored rice. It's easily my top five chicken rice in Singapore. The other dish was the Venison. AMAZING. AMAZING!!! I do not know which chef whipped up this dish, but I wish I could hug him. Brilliant. Five f*ing stars for the venison. Next time I visit this restaurant, my plan is to order an extra venison to go so I can lick the plate when I am done. It's that good! Trust!"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,22-Sep-13,"Move over, Tian Tian.  I never liked Tian Tian (despite all the ravings and international recognition) and good chicken rice like how I remembered it to be is a hard thing to find these days. WNK is how it should be.  Go for the roast chicken. It is amazing. Succulent and juicy with the perfect roasted skin that makes you want to lick the plate. So good that we ended up ordering another drumstick.  Rice is fluffy and flavorful. And I also liked that their chilli is spicier than the usual places ( which seems to be toning down the flavor to suit western palate) and they still serve it with the best kind of dark soy sauce (silky, thick, not too salty, takes forever to pour out of the bottle. Yeah!)  Thanks to the yelp singapore king, I saved half of my carb stomach for their $1 plain noodles. It is a simple plate of goodness.  It may be better in the old days, but for now, this one still totally hits the spot."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,25-Mar-15,"Love the chicken rice here.. I like the steam one better though the roasted one is also good. Their hainam rice is always be my fav.. The taste is rich though if i may suggest, they should choose a better type or rice to make it perfect. Tio miau (dunno how to spell it) is also one of my favorite.. Their price is like a hawker price with a very nice food  A bit noisy though, would be good if they can do something to reduce the noise"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,4-Jul-17,Came here during lunch hours. No wait if we wanted to share a table which was no problem with us. The chicken and rice was very good. Would go back just for that. Having AC helps!!
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,18-Jul-14,"Wee Nam Kee is the one chicken rice place that, when I say it's one of my faves, the locals tend to agree with me, or at least give a slight nod of approval (as opposed to a judge-y look and an emphatic HOW I KNOW YOU.)  On weekends the queue for this place is crazy, but weeknight dinners are manageable. Some complain it's a bit pricey for chicken rice, but in my opinion, it's still pretty affordable considering it's air conditioned.  I've tried both their (steamed/boiled?) chicken and their roasted chicken. If you've seen me on Talk answering questions about chicken rice and local cuisine, you'll know which one I'd almost marry (*whispers* it's the roasted one!)  After a year and a half on the island, I'm surprised at how I'm starting to notice the difference between everyone's recipes. I think Wee Nam Kee has the best chicken, but I stand by Boon Tong Kee's rice as the more flavorful and fragrant contender.  I'm a bit wary of recommending this place for someone who's never tried chicken rice, as I'm unsure if they'd appreciate or enjoy it as much. Plus, there are no ang mo celebrity chef endorsements here. :-P This is a great location in Novena; however you can also check out their other outlet in Marina Square if you can't venture too far from CBD."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",3,3-Jun-14,"Singaporeans are very passionate about their chicken rice. It's almost as difficult in trying to get a consensus when asking Chicagoans where to find the best deep dish pizza in the city. Everyone has their favorite chicken rice. Wee Nam Kee is one the popular choices for chicken rice in Singapore.  We order half a chicken and the meat is tender. The skin over the pieces of chicken is smooth but without the gelatinous layer under the skin like at Tian Tian. At Wee Nam Kee, the chicken sits on a layer of sweet-savory soy sauce that is very tasty (at Tian Tian, a golden glaze is used instead).  When it comes to choosing a personal favorite establishment for chicken rice, it is more than the chicken itself that come into consideration. The accompanying rice, chilli sauce, and ginger sauce are as important and they complete the chicken rice experience. The gold standard of rice that is part of the chicken rice experience should be fragrant (traditionally, uncooked rice is fried with chicken fat before the rice is placed in the rice cooker). At Wee Nam Kee, the rice is almost reminiscent of brown rice and there is a lack of fragrance, though the chilli and ginger sauce are a little better than just good. Overall, the chicken, chilli sauce, and ginger sauce are pretty good but the rice does not stand out here. If you want to have more than chicken rice, the kitchen here prepares other itmes such as deep fried stuffed tofu and stir-fried venison with ginger and scallions."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",3,28-Sep-16,"Prettt overrated. The only reason I'll come here and eat is because it's near my house and whenever I'm too lazy to travel this is the go to place for chicken rice. However, highly recommend whoever wants to enjoy a decent plate of chicken rice please go to Tian Tian at Maxwell. By far the best in Singapore!"
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,17-Apr-17,"Good chicken rice, probably my second favorite chicken rice place in Singapore. It also offers other dishes so you can have more than chicken rice for your meal. They accept credit card if your bill exceeds its minimum amount for payments in credit card."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,28-Dec-15,"This is one of the best Roasted Chicken Rice I've ever tasted. The meat is always well cooked. It doesn't have the disgusting raw chicken taste that some chicken rice have. The skin is well roasted just the way I like it. The price is cheap as well. The only thing I don't like is the ambiance. is always crowded and noisy during lunch time. The staff makes half of the noise, banging plates and utensils everywhere. The other half is made by the customers raising their voices trying to be heard by their friends and colleagues who are just across their table. Once you get past that, then nothing's stopping you from enjoying your delicious chicken rice."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,4-Jul-15,"This is a classic... I have never been disappointed. One of the better Chicken Rice joints of singapore that have not only maintained the taste, but also the service. Cost wise basic restaurant prices. Be prepared to pay about $40 for 3 pax. A must try place for every tourist."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,18-Dec-13,"Pretty nice place for chicken rice, but I guess this is due to the competition for chicken rice on that 1 corner across the Novena MRT. Ordered the Hainan rice with roast + bbq pork since I don't feel like eating chicken. The rice is fragrant and tasty, but the pork isn't that great - too dry. I guess I should've stayed with the restaurant name and ordered chicken."
Wee Nam Kee Chicken Rice,4.3,54,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,22-Mar-16,"Although they do chicken rice very well (go for the fried chicken), I love the food they cook in the kitchen. Their sambal kangkong is one of the best. I also like their teochew style steamed fish and salty vegetable soup. I go to Singapore every year and I try to come here once."
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",5,19-Aug-18,"I really enjoyed brunches. Decor and service were both charming, the prices were very decent for my plentiful breakfast combo, and the coffees were good and cleverly plated.  I will definitely be back."
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",4,11-Nov-23,"And above average brunch place in Singapore, you get the standard variety of brunch options like Benedict, various dishes, pasta, etc. they also have quite a number of drinks on the menu. We really like the decor of the place."
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",5,3-Apr-23,"Arrived a bit early for a family dinner around the corner and stopped in here to work a bit. Family-owned and it shows! Owner is solicitous and when I stopped back afterwards to pick up an umbrella I left behind, he asked me to stay and watch a musical performance that was going on, but I couldn't. Definitely on my favorites list."
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",4,22-May-21,"I was in the mood for a sweet brunch so ordered ice cream with waffles. The taste of the food was good but a bit pricey for the quality. The appeal was definitely the cafe decor. Very colorful, creative and captivating. I hope to sit in the popular car inside the cafe next time. Reservation service was very user friendly. Worth a visit!"
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",4,15-Oct-17,"In the heart of Rangoon, more famous for bak kut teh, is this hidden gem of a cafe. It has a laid back hippy charm and the service is very good. Unusual nowadays for cafes to have table service but it works for me and I will come back for sure. Special kudos with their Halloween menu and decorating the place so well.  Tip: they also bake their own bread which they provide to taste for free!"
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",4,20-Feb-22,A little pricey but the food was quite good. The in house coffee is quite interesting that requires the star to melt in the milk.
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",5,10-Sep-17,"Second visit there... love it! The service was warm and sweet. The food was awesome ... the coffee on the rock was mmmmm ... more than words can describe. I ordered their September monthly special, firey crab aglio oglio... it was good! The taste of the fresh crab meat blended in the pasta ... I think the chef cooked the pasta with the crab meat soup. It was really good! And their bailey coffee on the rock, it's superb as usual. It is a good place to catch up with friends."
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",4,25-Feb-19,"Soy mocha - 4 stars Decent! Asked for it to be less sweet so they reduced the chocolate syrup.  Chocolate on the rocks - 4.25 stars This was interesting! An espresso ice cube served with a pitcher of milk. This allows you to change up the flavour of your drink!  Ambience - 3 stars The place was a bit too dimly lit, crowded and kitschy for me to be honest."
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",5,7-Jun-16,"Let me just start off by saying that this is the best service I've ever received in Singapore.  I've never had wait staff be so kind or accommodating to me, especially when I'm one of those pesky caf¨¦ patrons who are there for the wifi. I'm definitely a demanding customer at times and they've always worked with me and with a smile! Once I was seated, I needed an outlet and they found a table with one, unplugged the diffuser that was currently using the outlet, and helped me move my things there. This kind of hospitality and problem solving is definitely rare in Singapore.  The food here is amazing as well. I had their King Caesar Salad and was expecting the same bland grilled chicken that every restaurant serves but no, this chicken had crackly skin and was delicious and flavorful!  I also ordered a chammomile tea with longan and expected it to get a pot with a bag of nice tea inside. Nope! I got a clear pot full of the individual ingredients. I've never received tea like that at a caf¨¦. It was such a pleasant surprise!  Finally, finally, I must give a shout out to their music. Whoever put together their playlist would have probably been my best friend in high school because it is such a random assortment of music I love but haven't heard in so long like Jennifer Love Hewitt's ""Bare Naked"" or ""Back to the Beginning"" from the Anastasia soundtrack. I have never been in a place where I actually know the obscure songs.  The only thing I don't like about this place is that it's so great, it makes it difficult for me to explore other places in my neighborhood because I'm happy to go here every time I need to work out of the office."
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",4,24-Feb-16,"Nice place to chill around the Farrer park area.  Passed by this place once and wanted to head over for lunch but unfortunately my friend chose another dining site instead.  Came here at 2 pm on a Wednesday after lunch and stayed more than 2 hours here. The door opening was pretty small and the door was tough to push. And the waitress helped me out and guided me to a seating which is brightly lit. Was also given menus to look at (the interesting part was when they gave me alcoholic menu to look at). Without much hesitation, decided to order a slice of cake and tea in a teapot.  Headed to the counter to see the available cake slices for the day and Thai milk tea cheesecake caught my eyes. For the tea, I headed for fruity tea and hence I ordered blissful berries tea.  The Thai milk tea taste was pretty mild but the cheesecake was silky and smooth; not too sweet either. Price wise it is reasonable for a decent slice of cake.  The berry tea was strong (depending how long you soak the tea leaves) and it has strong smell. I tend to go for a stronger aftertaste so I consumed it when it was darker in color. The tea came in a clear glass pot so you will see the color changes overtime (from the tea leaves) and you will see the floating berries as well.  Service was alright here. More servers to cater to more customers. So one will be greeted and served pretty quickly.  Love the antique touch in this cafe. It is also a good place to hang out and chill. Small touches added to increase the vibrancy of the cafe. I'll come back to try out their mains another time."
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",5,18-Nov-18,"Like this place! We came for Sunday brunch, not crowded. Food is delicious! Cajun chicken with rice ball is yummy, Spanish omelette is not bad, veggie pasta is in big portion, my son loves it so much. Good service as well! Will comeback again to try other dishes."
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",5,15-Nov-15,We ordered a set of Wake-me-up big breakfast and a mixed berries waffles.  Both are delicious and meet our expectation.  We felt homie and the staffs are extraordinary polite and helpful.  We sure will visit again!

Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",5,18-Feb-17,Really enjoyed the breakfast here as well as the customer service. Nice decor and close to Little India. Oh did I say the food is really good.
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",5,19-Mar-16,"Came for lunch - Loved the ambiance: eclectic place with lots of vintage decorations including a converted vintage car ! Very relaxed and easy going. Good for brunch, lunch, hanging out with with friends & family. The coffee was excellent and the food was yummy. We ordered the baked eggs and eggs benedict. The high tea set looked intruiging - will have to come check it out sometime."
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",4,16-Jun-17,"Instagram worthy Cafe. Nice desserts, cosy atmosphere, good place to chill out. The desserts were ok, nothing exceptional but presentation was good. Coffee was ok."

Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",3,5-Feb-18,"First, the coffee was excellent. And the cafe itself is pretty charming. But the French toast was cold and was pretty dry. There were no other customers when we ordered the two orders of French toast, so I really don't know how it could be cold.  Overall I would only recommend the coffee. Cute place, kind service. Worth stopping in."
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",4,31-Dec-17,"Very cute place! Matcha latte needed improvement. Low quality and too sweet, impossible to taste anything, but sugar :("
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",4,23-May-16,Greet ambience. Mushroom soup was Super yummy. Pancakes are so fluffy and the Spanish omelette was good too! Dessert was not disappointing too - had the molten lava cake with vanilla ice cream. Worth it! Great service too
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",2,15-Oct-17,"Ambiance is good, and service is fine, but the food is sub-standard. Poached eggs were over-cooked, and the Aglio Olio was really bad. The ""eternal garden"" tea is as flowery as it sounds, not at all like English breakfast, like the waitress said. Water was served in a paper cup, which seems like unnecessary environmental strain. Not great value for money..."
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",4,22-Oct-15,"My gf and I have been going to this place quite often. I love their coffee! I don't need to put sugar in it. Their egg Benedict is really nice and satisfies the cravings. We tried some other dishes before and guaranteed, our plates are EMPTY! Friendly service (a bit shy sometimes). Slightly cramped inside, but hey, it makes it cozy regardless. Love it."
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",5,10-Jan-16,"Cute place. Vintage decor and plays covers of mando and English pop songs. Good food and service, but no service charge!"
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",5,25-Dec-16,The ideal place to slow down your pace and have a relaxing cup of coffee. Great ambience with lovely time lost antique decorations sure to stir nostalgia. The food selection is wide and is updated frequently. Perfect place to hold gatherings!
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",5,4-Jun-18,"Excellent spot for western breakfast. Friendly service and great coffee. I had the baked eggs wrapped in crispy bacon, very yummy! I asked for an additional slice of toast and got that slice very quickly and free of extra charge. Much appreciated. Will certainly be back next time I'm in Singapore."
Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",5,3-Dec-17,"Absolutely love this place! Tried it on a whim after just moving to the neighbourhood and it was so worth it. The service is exceptional - very friendly and attentive. Great coffee, delicious food. Unfortunately my partners eggs were a bit cold but that was the only small issue. And the service we got completely made up for it. Plus the decor is really funky. Will be our new weekend brunch haunt for sure!"

Brunches Cafe,4.3,29,"Coffee & Tea, Bakeries, Breakfast & Brunch",2,25-Jun-16,"Good atmosphere. Taste is average BUT quantity is very small considering the $15-20 price range. My stomach is not even half full with $15 Egg bacon breakfast. Just 2 eggs with bacon inside, a small toast and small salad. May be good for girls but for a man, it's just too little."
Lim Chee Guan,4.3,11,"Barbeque, Specialty Food, Chinese",5,23-Jan-20,"Very tasty sweet pork jerky, they let you sample anything you want.  Bought a few items to be consumed in the hotel. Customs in LAX normally don't allow these types of items in the country.  For sure will be back!"
Lim Chee Guan,4.3,11,"Barbeque, Specialty Food, Chinese",5,16-Aug-19,"We passed by LCG while walking around Chinatown and saw the line. We stood in line not knowing what we were in for... we left with 3 bags of cured meats that lasted only a day.  Unbeknownst to my hubby and I, we stumbled across a Chitown institution. The place is small, no place to sit down. It's meant for people to order their goodies and leave. Which is what we did.  They had so many selections of cured meats... chicken, beef and pork. My fav was the honey bacon, it was sweet, salty, fatty and just the right amount of spice. These are very addicting and filling we end up skipping lunch.  Everything is sold per gram, the least I think is 100."
Lim Chee Guan,4.3,11,"Barbeque, Specialty Food, Chinese",5,14-Sep-17,"I think it was someone I was following on IG where I discovered Lim Chee Guan. I knew that this would be a shop my wife would love trying especially after hearing that their bak kwa was better than bee cheng hiang. We headed here right after we ate an early lunch at Hawker Chan just to make sure they didn't run out of stuff. The location is conveniently located right off of the subway stop (just make sure you head to New Bridge Rd and then turn right). If we were able to bring back meat products home, we would've brought back a few pounds of everything. We only ordered enough for us to snack on the plane ride home but did get a variety which were all tasty. The jerky here is definitely one of the best I've had and yes it does taste better than bee cheng hiang (which is just a few shops down). We didn't do a side by side comparison between the two but the flavors here seemed more well rounded and the texture seemed to be less tough and more palatable.  Just wished they had a stand inside HKIA then transiting through HK would be even more enjoyable. I just need figure out a way to get some of this awesome pork jerky back home without getting into trouble. Will definitely be back the next time I'm in Sing."
Lim Chee Guan,4.3,11,"Barbeque, Specialty Food, Chinese",4,17-Nov-13,"I have no idea why I was here. All I know the 2nd request from my Sister during our Weekend in Singapore is to come to Lim Chee Guan to pick up some bakkwas.  I guess I was really lucky and was here at Off Peak Hour as there were no one... at all queueing up. We have the full attention of the staff who was just so generous and let us sample most of the products they have for sale,  I love the spicy bakkwas, I can eat that the whole day. The taste of pork can be quite intense as this is the real deal.  My sister ended up picking up some items as souvenirs. Too bad I was not that lucky one!"
Lim Chee Guan,4.3,11,"Barbeque, Specialty Food, Chinese",5,11-Feb-14,"yes, i am a bak kwa snob! yes, i only eat lim chee guan's bak kwa!! yes, you can put me to a blind taste test and i can tell you if it is the real deal!!!:)  for the uninitiated, bak kwa is basically bbq meat jerky. and pork being the meat originally used in the manufacturing of this simple wonder. their signature here is the sliced pork bak kwa. and that is what i always get here. but for those of you who fancy some other types of meat, they do have beef and chicken too.  so just what makes them so good? it is a sweetness without being cloyingly so. it is a smoky charred bite without tasting burnt ends. it is the distinctively chewy yet tender pork slices that is not minced. it is the exquisite dark red hue that exudes an unmatched richness and complexity.  this used to be the one and only branch. then sprouted one directly opposite at people's park which many speculated was not authentic. but now both bear the same logo and shopfront look. and yet the queue lingers on at this original outlet. a queue that challenges sanity as each chinese new year approaches. this year, i heard an unbelievable mention of 7 hours wait in line. and the price was $52/kg.  the bak kwa index, as i like to call it, is a gauge of inflation. normally, the price goes up at CNY, retreats a little but still trends up over previous year's price. so after the peaks during CNY, today's bak kwa index stands at $50/kg! the forties mark are now but a distant memory.  lim chee guan has since gone upmarket with an outlet in ion orchard and it is there where queues are somewhat sane and in aircon comfort.  but for the sadomasochist, who ironically believes nothing short of a 3 hours queue is worth his time, this is just the place to be before CNY each year."
Lim Chee Guan,4.3,11,"Barbeque, Specialty Food, Chinese",5,19-Feb-17,"I've been a Bee Cheng Hiang fan for years as bak kwa is one of my favorite things to eat ever...but after someone recommended this place, I have to say it is just as good if not better. I usually go their standard pork and spicy pork. I did find that Lim Chee Guan's spicy is a bit more mild then Bee Cheng Hiang so if spicy is your thing perhaps Bee Cheng would be better.  But, great price, they seal the meat in a ziplock bag for you...great stuff."
Lim Chee Guan,4.3,11,"Barbeque, Specialty Food, Chinese",4,9-Aug-12,"Arguably the best and most popular traditional bak kwa (bbq pork) shop here in Singapore. During the days leading up to CNY, queues can easily snake all the way to the McDonald's at Lucky Chinatown, averaging 2-4 hours waiting time.  Often quick to scoff at these queues whenever I see them, I found myself amongst them this year. For the record, I waited approximately 2 hrs and 30 mins before my turn. I still find it amazing how bak kwa is a such a prized commodity during CNY. Customers from Hong Kong and Malaysia can be easily found among the Singaporeans buying kilos and kilos as gifts for relatives.  Yet It is not hard to understand why because the bak kwa definitely lives up to its reputation. Soft, tender and flavourful. Not greasy or tough and filled with fat like other commercial brands (i.e. Bee Cheng Hiang and Frangrance). Once you tried it, you wont want any of the cheaper options.  For those of you who have been hiding under a rock or just plain ignorant yet think highly of themselves, they have 3 shops in Singapore. The main and best is the one along New Bridge Road just beside Pagoda St near the MRT. Yes, thats the main one. Not the one across the road at People's Park Complex or the new fangled one at ION Orchard."
Lim Chee Guan,4.3,11,"Barbeque, Specialty Food, Chinese",4,28-Aug-12,"Lim Chee Guan's bakkwa has been a family favourite for as long as I can remember. Although I have had good bakkwas from other brand names such as bee cheng hiang and such, Lim Chee Guan's bakkwa has been the most consistent in terms of flavour and texture.  It has almost become a family tradition to queue for the bakkwa at Lim Chee Guan during the festive period. While it indeed seems pretty ridiculous to be standing in line for 2-3hours, the standard of bakkwa you get from Lim Chee Guan cannot be found elsewhere."
Lim Chee Guan,4.3,11,"Barbeque, Specialty Food, Chinese",4,8-Sep-13,"Although the 'other' yellow competitor seems to be more common place, my local friend recommended this one, so I accidentally stumbled across this in Chinatown, in between 2 Bee stores!  Taste: flavourful, glazy, but what biggest diff compared to home is that it's a lot thicker, chewier...at first, thought this was better value but actually costs more, since you're paying for weight too.  Packaging: much nicer here, own logo, a polished feel to it...pretty impressed w/ its history too.  Customer service: impressive--these guys would put any hardworking union guys to shame. can't imagine this tough work they do all day, under pressure w/ long lineups. also allowed to have samples.  Flavours i got were: mini bbq pork, chill, bacon and pork ends. didn't like the bacon as much.  Verdict? between the BKH at home, i'd say it's 1A & 1B ;)"
Lim Chee Guan,4.3,11,"Barbeque, Specialty Food, Chinese",4,29-Aug-12,"Despite being expensive and oily, the many customers who frequent Lim Chee Guan every day are living testimonies to the bahkwa's tastiness. There are even those who buy up to 2 or more kg worth of bahkwa for the entire family, I'm guessing, maybe to make their time in the queue worth their while. I usually try to go during off-peak periods since I mostly buy for myself and don't need a lot, which makes queuing up seem incredibly tiresome.The bahkwa is not too sweet and fragrant, with a nice chewy texture. For a Chinese New Year celebration, I'd say that this is absolutely essential in any household to entertain guests."
Lim Chee Guan,4.3,11,"Barbeque, Specialty Food, Chinese",2,25-Jan-19,we queue since 7.30am since this morning. and we were told SOLD OUT at 1.30pm for their signature sliced pork... haiz....
Ki-sho,4.8,12,"Japanese, Sushi Bars",5,28-Nov-19,"This is by far my best sushi experience outside of Japan.  The moment that you enter the dining area, you can feel the calmness of the chef and his staff. Everything is executed to perfection and extreme precision.  We had the 450 set menu and it was delightful. The presentations are fabulous and the flavours are exceptional.  If there is heaven on earth, it is located @ 29 Scotts road in a colonial bungalow."
Ki-sho,4.8,12,"Japanese, Sushi Bars",5,24-Dec-16,"A fine restaurant tucked away in a colonial bungalow at Scotts Road, I was surprised by the tranquility and calmness brought on by the simple decoration of the interior.  The food was nothing short of amazing, as one would expect from the prices. We had the $150+ lunch and the portions were just right. We were extremely satisfied at the end - not full enough to curse ourselves for torturing our tummies, yet not hungry enough to crave for more food.  Every dish was executed to perfection, and I enjoyed sitting at the bar watching the chefs at work.  Recommended!"
Ki-sho,4.8,12,"Japanese, Sushi Bars",4,18-Oct-19,"Had a great experience at Ki-sho. My favorite courses were the kobe beef with truffle, sashimi plate and the uni, ikura and maguro rice. The fish here was super fresh as expected with the price point. The beef was also melt in your mouth. I think I would've enjoyed the dinner courses more as not a lot of the omakase courses were traditional and had a lot of fusion aspects to it and interesting mixes with vegetables. But definitely the chefs were very skilled, albeit very quiet. For dessert the melon was very fresh and the ice flavored very well but the other dessert bites were less interesting."
Ki-sho,4.8,12,"Japanese, Sushi Bars",4,29-Jan-20,"Among the top sushi restaurants in Singapore, 2-Michelin-star Shoukouwa is my least liked, whereas no-star Ki-sho is my fav. Perhaps because in season it's usually an uni orgy that sends sea urchin lovers to Cloud Nine. For the best experience, splurge for the $450++ Omakase dinner menu. Extremely fresh ingredients, diversity, and mastery of techniques by talented chef Hamamoto."
Ki-sho,4.8,12,"Japanese, Sushi Bars",4,30-May-13,"WARNING: THIS IS A PAID REVIEW! i.e. i did not have to pay for my meal as it was a bonus treat!:)  this was a kaiseki experience with suntory whiskies.  we arrived in good time for the event at 7pm. the hakushu 12yo with soda made it's round. very light and delicate. free flow of finger food made it's round. kumiage yuba with wasabi, french oyster with ikura and braised hida wagyu with white miso. all excellently done and a prelude to what's to come.  then the drizzle got heavier and the wait for the opening reception speech became a drag. taking shelter within the colonial bungalow, you can take in the zen gardens whilst the blah blah blah continues outside.  by the time we were shown upstairs to the dining rooms it was already 8pm. most definitely should have wallop more of those appetizers!:(  the room set up was nothing grand, nothing romantic. much like dining in somebody's house.  service was good though, knowledgeable staff who spoke japanese when required.  the menu for the night looked impressive and i couldn't help feeling even hungrier!  so what's up first? the hakushu 12 yo again??? bring me food! obviously my priorities were all wrong! finally, the first course arrived. junsai with abalone and ikura served in a fresh uni shell. nice but flavours were not really strong enough.  second course was what? the hakushu 18yo??? bring the food!!! ok thanks, the kasumi port snow crab and hokkaido uni, oscietra caviar soon followed. yums! sweet snow crab submerged in rich uni and the caviar added a salty finish to the dish.  third course??? assorted sashimi!!! thank god there was no whisky pairing for this! and this is indeed what i would die for. super fresh slivers of sashimi that easily rivals shinji! can i have another plate, please!?  fourth course??? the yamazaki 12yo!!! twiddling thumbs. then the charcoal grilled lobster with suntory yamazaki flavour was presented. this is super atas ""drunken prawns"" very well executed! after wolfing down the morsels of this crustacean monster you cant help wanting to lick the empty shells still soaked with jus de homard.  fifth course? are we there yet? how do people drive home from such events? do you just swirl, sniff, sip and spit? sorry wrong alcohol. hibiki 12 yo was next. check yelp mobile.......... the steamed kinki and scallop was a mere bite size but packed a culinary punch! simple steaming but steam sia!  around this time, the GM of suntory whisky, hiroyoshi miyamoto made his rounds. and we politely oblige by saying the yamazaki 12yo was really nice with a peach, persimmon, orange aroma. next.  the sixth course. the yamazaki 18yo. and the charcoal grilled hida wagyu with hibiki flavour. sweet caroline! no comparison other than awesome. chef kazuhiro hamamoto really brings his food to life.  the seventh course. at this stage, our eyes were already in slumber mode and the glasses of unfinished whisky crowded out the table. what is our exit strategy? how am i going for my karaoke date? put your hands together and welcome hibiki 17yo! food please!? aburi otoro sushi as predicted was only 2 pieces. and one was but chu toro. nonetheless both were tantalizingly tasty.  finally, a quick sip of a beautifully clean clam miso soup and we slipped away forgoing dessert and tea.  it was indeed suntory time but somehow lost in translation.  p/s: i must come back for the food and food alone."
Ki-sho,4.8,12,"Japanese, Sushi Bars",5,24-Jun-19,"Sugoi (incredible) umami (savoury) sushi by chef Kazuhiro . A dinner during white truffle season is the best. Uni (sea urchin) & white truffles make a very innovative & interesting combination. Next the amadai horse head fish with its deep fried crispy scales & hot steamy snapper in soup make for a close to Tokyo style sushi experience at the 10 seater bar counter, not forgetting creamy sweet chutoro/otoro/maguro (tuna belly). Dessert is also definitely a treat with their homemade mochi & special tea ice cream filled macaron.  I've been back every now & then since 2017. Ki sho sources for a variety of different species of high quality uni's around japan and they have their own housebrand sake. Service is top notch & conversations with chef Kazuhiro is always interesting!"

Highlights: The fish were fresh (like, fresh off the sea fresh), the wagyu was juicy and fatty (like how it should be), the signature uni + rice was an explosive symphony of flavors.  Service: The staff were too cute. Not only were they extremely attentive throughout the entire meal, they spoilt me with a birthday cake towards the end. The entire crew, yes including both sushi chefs, stood around and sang a birthday song - #win  Highly recommended."
Ki-sho,4.8,12,"Japanese, Sushi Bars",5,15-Jun-16,"In my opinion, this is the only Japanese restaurant in Singapore worthy of 3 Michelin Stars and I hope they get it next month.  They do everything right here, from the food to the setting to the service to the sake. It's a complete experience from beginning to end and beyond.  Yes this is expensive, moreso than any other of the Singapore high end Japanese spots (maybe moreso than ANY restaurant in Singapore, possibly more than Hashida) but you truly get what you pay for. Chef Hamamoto-San is a true artist and you will see it in the presentation you get to enjoy.  My girlfriend and I went for the full-fledged omakase as well as the Ki-Sho branded sake which I would HIGHLY recommend. It's essentially a smooth and elegant Juyondai sake and you won't believe how quickly you will finish it.  A side note, one of the criteria for restaurants to receive 3 Michelin Stars (outside of Japan) is that they must master each of the major food groups and include it on their tasting menu - that includes sea, MEAT, veggies, and dessert at the very least. Ki-sho makes a bold statement from the beginning as the first course if a beautifully tasting and hard to get beef nigiri. The rest of the experience was amazingly done and Chef Hamamoto-san himself is a lot of fun to talk to. Be careful because this meal will leave you extremely full.  Even though most top-tier sushi restaurants have chefs and staff that know their sake very well (except for a certain place that has two hotel locations and enjoys only recommending what is most expensive at both locations), Ki-sho also has an in-house sake sommelier that is the best. I highly recommend you check out his upstairs sake bar, you'll go on a sake adventure with his insanely huge collection of all different types of sakes from all over Japan. They also serve food up there too so check it out for a more casual night of something different rather than going to a typical bar.  I highly recommend that you check this place out if you want the epic Japanese omakase experience in Singapore."
Ki-sho,4.8,12,"Japanese, Sushi Bars",5,10-Aug-14,"Wow ... Dis is Japan ?? Ohh - we in Singapore ... Finest selection of top high end Sake Top Food prepared for you .. No thinking, just sit back .. Sip your sake take photos & simply enjoy .. Love it Life is Good"
Ki-sho,4.8,12,"Japanese, Sushi Bars",5,3-Sep-16,"Oh man, can the food get any better than this... Yummmmm! Says your mouth every time you place the nigiri on your tongue. The fish is ever convoluted and rich with flavours from the mysterious depths of the ocean.  When you come here, you have to go for the Omakase. From the vast assortment of dishes, Chef Hamamoto-san places the fish at just the perfect temperature, perfect amount of wasabi, and consistency of rice for my taste. (I know some other Michelin-star restaurants would prefer to leave the frozen fish out to room temperature or put twice as much wasabi between the fish and rice, which is perfectly fine, just not my most favorite form). His humble and warm demeanour makes the whole place so much more inviting and lively. The service is superb, but then again with a great chef as Hamamoto-san, you wouldn't expect anything less.  At the end of the very filling and pleasant meal, we conversed with the chef for a while. When everyone had retired for the evening, he invited us to his upstairs sake bar. Unfortunately we had to politely decline: ""Next time, next time...!"" We said as we almost stumbled out the door from a food comma.  It's been months since I last came here, but my tongue from the north still remembers."
Ki-sho,4.8,12,"Japanese, Sushi Bars",5,25-Feb-17,"My experience here is wonderful. The food is unbelievably good... it is the first time I have sea urchins and it was so good. I can't take prawns and crab, the restaurant easily replace those with others which was equally delicious.  Then finally while we are having our desert, the host brought out a birthday cake from the kitchen. I was so surprised. Me and Husband have not informed the staff in any way that it was my birthday... I have no idea how they knew. The cake was awesome and I felt like a million bucks!!!  The service is truly amazing! So was the food! this lunch today left me smiling like an idiot. I didn't managed to get the names of the staff. I conclude that this must be some 3 star Michelin restaurant. We will definitely be back again!"
Ki-sho,4.8,12,"Japanese, Sushi Bars",5,26-Mar-14,"The best charm of Ki-sho in addition to its authentic interior and Japanese culteries is its food and people. With food freshly flown in from Kyoto and around the world, Chef Kazu serves only the best, and will happily prepare food in accordance to diners' dietary requirement. The service staffs are prompt and sincere, making dining at Ki-sho feels like stepping into a little piece of Kyoto right in the middle of Orchard Road.  The omakase dishes are intricately designed, balancing the tastes from the different flavours of the ingredients. I had shirako (cod sperm), fugu (puffer fish) and uni (sea urchin) for the first time at Ki-sho and thoroughly enjoyed them. Desserts were light, sweet and an intoxicating end to a great evening. The restaurant also has a wide selection of sakes available for pairing with the dishes.  For the special occasions and days of self pampering, I highly recommend Ki-sho."

Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,13-Mar-20,"Oh yeah...what a date...  What really made this date is the fantastic views...views of my date of course!  The cuisine is high end, service is high end, location is definitely high end...you can't eat any higher in Singapore unless your're on SQ1 back to the US.  Please...try to enforce a dress code. It's kind of a downer when we are all dressed up and a jeans and tshirt dude strolls in like he just got done washing my car."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",3,28-Dec-15,"I had been to this restaurant a number of times, but this was the first I was coming for afternoon tea. The Afternoon Tea Platter costs $38++ per person, inclusive of a tea or coffee, or $53++ per person including a glass of G.H Mumm Champagne. It is available from 2.30pm to 4:45pm. The coffee is non refillable, while as for tea one could ask for refillable of hot water.  The afternoon tea platter consisted of Crostini, avocado, cherry tomato, olive, Ham & turkey, beetroot, manchego, tortilla, Smoked salmon, cucumber, chive, cr¨¨me cheese on rye, Chocolate & jam lamington, Coffee macaroon, Tim tam chocolate tart, Red velvet cup cake, Anzac biscuit, Citrus marshmallow, and Scones.  The tea set was nicely plated but I felt that it was a bit too overpriced for such little food. May I was expecting much more from this price. The Citrus marshmallow is my favourite as it had a rather zesty taste which peaked one up. The rest were not bad too.  I had requested for a table by the window through online reservation, but was showed to a table by the frosted window with no view of the outside. Not sure if it was due to the fact that I was having a 3 years old boy with me at the time. We were seated far away from other customers and had difficulties getting the attention of the staff. As it was between lunch and dinner meal times, there was limited choices for a 3 years old. No children menu, so ended up ordering French fries ($11++) for him. Total bill for the fries was $12.95."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",3,14-Aug-17,"The food wasn't memorable or anything. I opted with the tasting menu so I can at least enjoy the scenic views a little bit longer, but I soon realized halfway into the tasting menu, that I just wanted to leave.  The food wasn't bad, but this was no fine dining. The dessert which was the apple and liquorice cream was the only decent thing from the menu.  So lesson learned...if you visit Salt Grill, stick with the regular menu, or just hang out at the bar and order at least $80 worth of drinks since that's the minimum amount to hang out here. But it will probably only take you 2-3 drinks to get to this amount since cocktails will run around $25 a drink.  Views are great though."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,28-Jun-19,We celebrated our honeymoon dinner At salt grill and sky bar. Friendly professional staff we loved our server "eff" she was really helpful for us to pick the right dinner . The glass down and the view is magical from this place .
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",4,8-May-19,"The view is impressive. The dishes are more beautiful to look at than to eat. We had the set lunch. Except for the excellent and gorgeous-looking steak tartare appetiser, all other dishes were good but not memorable. Salt's rib eye was too salty. But then, at $49++, this is not bad value for the overall experience."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,12-Feb-16,"Wow. a totally unexpected surprise. We've been meaning to check this place out for awhile bc of its great view from the 50th+ storey of Ion Orchard, but kept postponing our visit bc we were told from friends that the food is not worth it. You are basically paying for the view, they'd say. But we decided to finally try it out on a random Sunday lunch, and ultimately and surprisingly had one of the most satisfying dining experience in Sing.  1. The service was perfect. From the moment we walked in, we were pleasantly greeted and escorted to one of the many seats next to the windows for the perfect view and we were able to see our condo from our seat! the kind and attentive waiter really knew his menu and was always readily available. 3. The lunch set menu was so much cheaper than we expected, at $49 for 3 courses including tea or coffee. what a bargain, considering the location and the fact that the dishes mimicked that of dishes at fine dining, or were even better. 4. the dishes were so delicious! to start, they gave us complimentary radish snack with homemade potato chips.  for Entree, we got: -'Glass' Sydney crab omelette in miso mustard broth, their signature dish which was okay for me, but D loved it. -Baked bone marrow, onion, watercress, and garlic toast. this is the entree to get. bone marrow was the best I've tried in a long time! It was prepared in such a way that I've never tried before, drenched in garlic and other sauces, and it was just perfection with the garlic toast pairing.  Main course: -Seared Blue Fin tuna, potato, pimento, softquail egg, olives & anchovies dressing: never thought i'd write a comment on an egg, but i've never tried an egg that was cooked So perfectly that it's bouncy yet so soft. tuna and all the ingredients came together so well. -Goats cheese gnocchi, beets, vincotto, burnt butter dressing, pistachio, raisons: again, the ingredients in the dish came together so well, that we were forking everything together in one-bite to experience the bursting of flavors. it was perfect.  dessert: we got the sorbet, crumbs and berries and dessert of the day which was a winner.  We exited the restaurant as if we paid over $200 for the service, location, and the amazing food, when it was around $110 altogether. Why didn't we come sooner? it's a perfect place for dates, girl dates, and for visitors as well!"
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",4,21-Mar-13,"Restaurant Week lunch. I have always wanted to try the food at Salt Grill & Sky Bar but it is always full during restaurant week, well, except for this week.  Reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars: The experience was marred from the beginning when I saw the email on Tuesday (they sent it Sunday afternoon, but I didn't check email till Tuesday...some people are not chained by email :p) where it asked if I could change my dining time to 11.30 am or 11.45 am instead of 12 pm. The reason was due to the overwhelming response and so we will only have 1 hour 15 mins to dine if we come at 12 pm.  The question that pop into my head was ""didn't they already have a fix number of tables for Restaurant Week""? and ""Why was this not indicated when making the booking?"" And this was not the first time Salt has participated in Restaurant Week, wouldn't they have known better on what to expect?  It is quite disconcerting to have to re-arrange our schedule just so we will not have a rushed lunch. In any case, we decided to change our reservations to 11.30 am. I got there just before 11.30 am and was told the restaurant was not ready as the staff are getting their briefing then. 2nd strike. I made the effort to be on time, and at the time suggested by the restaurant, I would expect to be granted the courtesy to be seated accordingly. Cooling my heels for a while, it was another 5-10 minutes later before I was finally shown to a table.  The ""3rd"" not so happy experience was very minor - I asked for a window table but I was told it was for non-restaurant week customers...that reason did not fly with me as a friend had the window table the day before and she was also dining on Restaurant Week menu. Anyway, that was really a minor thing but the whole pre-dining experience was enough to make me put Salt on the ""first and last time"" dining list.   Back to the place and food:  I like the simplicity of the place with its high ceiling and modern furnishing. Service was professional, attentive, polite and not overly friendly. What caught me by surprise was the basket the manager brought over for us to put our bags. That was thoughtful.  Water was topped up without having to ask (they do ask if you want still or sparkling water, but you could request for warm or iced tap water at no extra cost), the courses were well paced so we did not feel rushed. In the end we left slightly after 1.15 pm, but never once were we made to feel we had to hurry through the meal. So kudos to the service staff for making the actual dining experience to be enjoyable after all.  Restaurant Week Menu: Starter - chicken liver foie gras parfait, truffled butter, toasted brioche. This was really superb. A generous serving of smooth pate in a small jar which went very well with the brioche and complimentary bread  Main - Maori lakes tenderloin, blue cheese pressed potato, spinach and red wine jus. I asked for medium and it was done just right, not too bloody with a bit of pink in the center. The meat was just so tender and juicy (still cannot compare to American beef in flavor) that it was with sadness when I popped in the last bite. I wished it was a bigger portion. Just have to come back next time for the 200 gm served in the ala carte menu. The pressed potato (in thin slices) with blue cheese was ok, just a hint of blue cheese so those who do not like it will not be turned off by it.  Dessert - tasting platter Creme Brulee with salted caramel ice cream - my favorite of the lot. Creamy custard covered with the sugar glaze and topped with salted caramel ice cream. There were also chocolate pearls hidden giving it a nice crunch.  Chocolate bar - surprisingly I did not find it that great. There were some wafer bits which tasted a bit soft, not crispy at all.  Licorice ice cream with lime and sago - never a big fan of licorice though the lime did give it a bit of contrasting flavor and made it more palatable to me.  Coffee was normal. You could select the tea of your choice, you just have to ask them what is available.  So yes, I would want to go back again, just to have the tenderloin and for the view. It is a very nice view and will probably be fantastic to dine in the evening to see the sunset.  NOTE: To get there, you need to turn right and right and left (when you see the TV) to get to the elevator to Salt Grill. It can get a tad confusing and dark to find."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,15-Jan-19,"Experience: I went here for my birthday and loved it. They had such tasty cocktails and great cuts of meat, which they brought out to show us and explain each cut. Since we came for my birthday, they also had the option to leave a birthday message on the dessert we ordered. When we ordered a black coffee and they brought a cappuccino, I let them know so that they could exchange it and they took it off the bill altogether. They are clearly very eager to please.  Environment: Clearly a fine dining place. They have a walkway along a wall of windows where you can look out at all the places in Singapore. The windows are marked with small signs noting what part of the city it is (chinatown, downtown, etc).  Food: The steak was so good. I got the flat iron which was known for its high marbling rating (I think it was 6-7+), but you can always ask them there for more details. All of the sides were good too, but the main dishes that stuck out were the steaks and the desserts: the pavlova was delicious, and such a hard dessert to get right.  Price: It's a nice place to be prepared to pay top dollar. Steaks are anywhere for $60-$100+ and even a cocktail is $20-$25. I'm sure you can get other dishes not quite as expensive as the steaks, but I think that is the main appeal of a nice place like this.  Service: Fantastic, but a little slow towards the end (when we ordered small things like coffee to finish off the meal)."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",4,20-Apr-18,"The obvious wow factor for this place is the sweeping view. We went to dinner and had unfettered view of the Singapore skyline - that was remarkable.  The food is generally good, with some misses. We did not care about the crab omelette that came highly recommended. But the Bungalow pork and octopus were both great starters. For mains, the sirloin was overly crusted but was good. Grilled asparagus on the side was also very good. I would rate the food a solid 3.5-stars but pushed it up to four for the excellent wine recommendation.  Service here is strange. The disposition of the staff is wonderful. They are all friendly without being patronising. But there were service lapses. For example, we ordered three starters. Two were served together, then there was a 45-minute wait before the third one arrived.  Worth a visit!"
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,30-Jul-14,"My husband and I recently celebrated my birthday here, and I had a wonderful time! (I say ""I"" because I stuck him with the bill at the end of the night!)  Salt Grill is an awesome place for a special occasion dinner, and I also agree with the other reviewers who say it's a good venue for treating out your parental units.  To get there, head to the concierge at the 4th floor of Ion. Walk around the desk and you'll see the welcome area for Salt. Someone will guide you to the special elevator bank that will whisk you up to the 55th floor.  Walking into the main dining room, your breath will be taken away by the lovely views of Singapore. I'm glad we went here for dinner because I enjoyed watching the city light up and transition from early evening to dusk.  To start, we ordered the oysters (served natural), and the 'glass' Sydney crab omelette. I can't comment on the oysters as I'm allergic, but I will say the Sydney crab omelette was a-ok. I know people rave about it, but it's simply not my type of dish.  However, I really loved our main. We did the meat cut for two, which changes daily. That day, it was a bone-in ribeye. It came with onion rings, a rocket salad, and mash. Miguel doesn't like potatoes much, so we asked if we could replace the mash with the roast garlic mushrooms and luckily they obliged.  The rocket salad was my type of salad: blue cheese, pear, and candied walnuts. All so good! The steak was juicy and I loved the horseradish/pepper jus that it was drenched in. Throw in a decent bottle of wine (we decided on a cab sauv from California) and we were in heaven.  For a moment, I was worried because the table next to us brought a baby with them... but thankfully the baby was quiet and didn't disturb our dinner. Overall, the ambiance was set nicely with the dim lighting and bossa nova soundtrack in the background. The service was impeccable and we didn't feel rushed at all throughout the evening. If you're feelin' spendy, this is a great option to consider. :)"
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",4,11-Oct-14,"If you want to score, this is the place to bring your wife or girlfriend! Salt Grill oozes with sex appeal. You enter the restaurant through a welcome area on the 4th floor of ION and through a special elevator bank behind the art gallery. Once you reach the top floor, you are greeted by a beautiful dining space and jaw dropping views of Singapore.  Making a reservation is a must, especially if you want to secure a spot with one of the limited tables that line glass viewing area.  Our order included: raw oysters, glass Sydney crab omelette, rocket salad, and bone-in ribeye steak for two. The glass Sydney Crab Omelette was a definite winner and is a must have appetizer. The Rocket Salad with blue cheese, pear and candied walnuts is a great choice for anyone in the mood for a refreshing salad.  The clear highlight for me was without question the Bone-in Rib Eye. The steak was juicy, perfectly cooked, and mouth watering. However, I'm a fanatic of steaks that are juicy on the inside and crisp on the outside (Heston Blumenthal way of cooking steak). Don't get me wrong, Salt grill delivers a damn good steak, but I can't give it the ""best in Singapore"" designation. The restaurant was also nice enough to alter my sides from mash potatoes to roasted garlic mushrooms, free of charge.  Overall, Salt is a wonderful restaurant and is among the very best in Singapore. 5 stars for the ambience and breathtaking views and 4 stars for the food."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,9-Dec-12,"This is a review of a Friday evening dinner date at Salt grill and Sky bar.  I have to admit the view is pretty spectacular. Well, if you like urban skylines (I do), it is.  I was late. My date was even later. The staff made no mention of this.  The room is a very well appointed. It is an impressive space with both modern and classic touches. There is a large glass roof. It truly hearkens to my expectations of traditional white-tablecloth fine-dining.  I was surprised that the restaurant was only halfway full. It is a very quiet and restrained restaurant. The staff even sings ""Happy Birthday"" in a barely audible tone.  This continues to spill over into the service. This is professional and polite. It is reserved. It is attentive. There isn't any unnecessary chit-chat.  The service was impeccable. It was timely. The staff was there when they should be. The server was knowledgeable. This is the very essence of fine dining service. The meal was also well-paced.  This was the first restaurant I've visited in Singapore that offered a complimentary glass of champagne to start the meal.  The food ranged from good to extremely good. The presentation of each dish was another classic touch. They were beautifully plated without giving into to being overly showy.  Complimentary Bread - A very nice fresh bread was provided. It was served with olive oil and a mixture of high quality salt to dip it in. When she quickly answered no to ""would you like more bread"", my dinner companion saved me from my own appetite.  http://tinyurl.com/c2wjy4n  Scallop raviolo in squid ink pasta, spiced tomato consomme, corn puree - I only had one bite of this. It ended up squarely in front of my date. It was very rich. If they provided this as a main dish, I could easily order it. For me, all of the ingredients worked well together. I do not have a photo of this dish.  Roasted cherry tomatoes, Burrata cheese, peppers, grilled bread - This was extremely good. It came close to allowing the red peppers to dominate. But the creaminess of the Burrata and the sweetness of the roasted tomatoes helped to keep them in check. The bread was grilled perfectly to hold the dish together.  http://tinyurl.com/akv3ufg  Duck sliders, pickled spring onion, cucumber - These were very good. If I had my choice, I would probably have selected a high quality Western style bun over the more Asian style presentation. Excluding the ""bun"", the ingredients provided an almost bahn mi experience.  http://tinyurl.com/catdjll  Lamb cutlets Maori Lakes New Zealand, Provencal herbs - My friend ordered the lamb. She was kind enough to share a bite. It was very good. The balance of the flavour of the lamb was perfect for my own personal taste. She seemed to enjoy it also.  http://tinyurl.com/azdxbho  Corn fed Spatchcock, Cajun and herb spices - I am not quite sure what made this dish a spatchcock, a cooking term for removing the main two bones and cooking the chicken flat. I am also not sure what made it cajun. It was certainly too mild to be considered Cajun. However, it was extremely good. The chicken was moist and tender. While not particularly Cajun, the spices came together very well. In finer restaurants, I seldom order chicken. I am glad I tried theirs. It was some of the best chicken I've had in quite awhile.  http://tinyurl.com/aou4p6q  We had sides of truffled mashed potato and roasted mushrooms. Each of these were prepared in a very traditional manner. They both served as comfortable compliments to our main dishes.  Pear Torte - This was her selected dessert. I tried it. I would have preferred the pear to be a little softer. Plus, the pear tasted more like an an apple to me. But, it was a nice dessert.  http://tinyurl.com/b2hamn8  Cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e with salted caramel ice cream - This was not a traditional cr¨¨me br?l¨¦e. There was no hard carmelized layer to crack through. For me, this dessert was more about the combination of ingredients with the ice cream as the anchor of the dish. I thought it was a great way to end the meal.  http://tinyurl.com/ag39gu9  Receipt ($489.63)  http://tinyurl.com/bys3jbk  Overall, Salt grill + Sky bar offers exactly what I expect from a true fine-dining experience. The room is beautiful. The staff is professional and on-point. The meal flows at a proper pace. The food is consistently very good. It also affords that added touch of a truly beautiful urban view.  Throughout writing this review, I mentally debated four stars or five stars. A part of me thought the food fell just slightly short. Another part thought the enjoyment of the experience was slightly diminished by the fact the room was not nearly full.  In the end though, I do think this was a five star experience."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",4,11-Oct-12,"third restaurant week date in a row!  for the uninitiated, you need to head to the 4th floor of ion, where the visitor's info booth is. their reception is co located there. they will then show you the way to a separate lift to the premises. they open at 6pm sharp, so even if you are early you cant get in.  this is definitely a date impressing kind of place. the view reminds me of equinox and jaan.  this is the most expensive of the restaurant week menu priced at $55. so in effect you are probably paying $20 for the view?  the restaurant week set dinner is made up of 3 courses:  for the first course, we had the 'glass' Sydney crab omelette, miso mustard broth. nice flavour from the crab as well as the mild miso mustard broth. lots of garnishing on top which can be a nightmare for some.  for the main, the spatchcock is highly recommended. a juvenile chicken butterflied for faster cooking. it was very well seasoned and cooked to perfection. tender to the fork and juicy in the mouth. the grape and currant dressing gave the dish a sweet edge. the parsnip mash is also a nice change from the usual mash that we get.  for dessert, you get a liquorice parfait in lime jus. can sound foul to some, including myself, who is not a fan of liquorice. but to my utter surprise, i was won over and really enjoyed it! the liquorice was used in moderation. and it was cleverly musked by the fresh lime juice, zest and lime fruit slices. you still get an after taste of liquorice but not a strong lingering one. pieces of thin biscuit wafer were delightfully crisp and buttery.  the coffee that came with the set was sad! i guess i am comparing it to the one i had at latteria which was awesome. one sip and i abandoned ship. maybe it would be safer for you to go with their tea instead.  if you would like wine to accompany your meal, they do have 2 special offer for restaurant week. however, we chose to go with the luke mangan's red and white wine by the glass in their ala carte menu.  now for the ala carte orders:  i started with the Fig tart with caramelized onion and blue cheese, verjuice dressing. the waiter duly reminded that it will take 12 mins to prepare this dish. must be really good then!:) it did not disappoint. the figs could be sweeter though. a thin pastry base topped with caramelized onions then round flat slices of fresh figs and finally some melted blue cheese and some sprouts. again the blue cheese may not go well with some, but i liked it.  for mains, i had the Scotch 250g Rangers Valley VIC 300 days grain fed. grilled to medium and served on a bed of french beans with red wine jus. i had the english mustard and horse radish on the side. the beef was not spectacular. cooked as requested but only average in flavour. priced at $75, again you must be paying $20 for the view?  we also ordered a side of Broccolini with confit eschallot. i must say they do their veg very well. not one strand was overcooked. all al dente. they could, however, be more generous with their confit eschallot though.  service staff here are obviously all seasoned ones and very well drilled. japanese style efficiency in just in time precision.  more hits than misses and if you are willing to pay more for the view and romantic ambience then you will be a fan too."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",1,5-Jan-19,"My wife and I had dinner here last night on the 55th floor observation level next to a dirt streaked window. I had a soggy, water logged salad, and a steak not cooked as requested (medium well, but served with a pink thick center), with the over spiced, gamely taste required of controlled rot (""aged"") meat. My wife's fish entree was too salty and in an unpleasant pickled sauce. One star for a nice dim light atmosphere."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",4,6-Dec-17,"Plus: Nice view and high staff's hospitality. Booking through web or phone easily.  Minus: Food is good enough, can't be excellent. Table arrangement are too close, can't have private space."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",3,6-Feb-17,"I've been dying to try this place for a while now, mainly because I love steak & was curious about the 56th floor of ion. So when the fianc¨¦ brought me here for my birthday, I was really excited.  They do have a wide array of cuts, and I loved that they brought over a giant platter and explained which cut was served for each dish. It made it easier to chose. Their meat was pretty good, though mine was a little over (asked for rare, but it was closer to medium rare/medium). Their red wine sauce was really good though!  Francis and I were a little over ambitious and thought we could finish a side of asparagus, oyster mushrooms, and onsen egg, but we couldn't. This side dish did taste a little strange though, still can't figure out why I didn't like it that much.  Dessert was average, the chocolate lava cake was slightly over baked so it didn't ooze out nicely.  I wouldn't say I'm super disappointed, but I'd probably only go back there for the meat and the view."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,8-Aug-12,"Oh my gawd, where do I even start? Let's start with the view! Located right on top of ION Orchard, the restaurant gives you a fantastic visual treat of the city, whether night or day.  The food is supposedly ""Modern Australian"", but you don't have to care what it's called, just know that it's marvellously good. All the ingredients are fresh, the dishes unique and the presentation impeccable.  And no wonder: it's opened by celebrity chef Luke Mangan and there are only seven of such restaurants worldwide (although one of his proteges have taken over the running of the Singapore branch).  I had the Maori Lakes beef tenderloin, which is so good my vocabulary fails me. The Barramundi fillet is also fantastic, but not everybody will like the sauce it comes in. And if you love sashimi, you have to try their version!  For dessert, you must try the chocolate mousse. You'll regret it for the rest of your life if you don't!  I'll definitely come back the next time my wallet feels thick enough."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,16-Apr-16,"I've been to this place twice with business associates and both times were top notch. I can't say enough about this place. It has a great view, a nice atmosphere, attentive waiters and waitresses and amazing food. It's a quiet restaurant which I enjoyed very much with being able to have a quiet and enjoyable conversation with my associates. The appetizers and desserts are quite small, which I really like, because it allows you to enjoy an entire meal without feeling over stuffed.  Make sure that you have a reservation because this place is really sought after. ENJOY!"
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,22-May-16,"How can I objectively write a review view from the 57th floor, overlooking Singapore and not be swayed by the views?!?! Food was actually very nice. Beginning with the sharing starters, the bone marrow (not for me, but others enjoyed) and charred octopus were delicious. Main entree was the pan fried snapper and squid ink risotto -- wonderful! Desert was a strawberry cream and perfect. Service was equally outstanding, great evening with work colleagues on the top table overlooking the city. Incredible experience!"
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",4,23-Oct-15,The 3 course lunch meal was totally worth it at $63 ++ with the breathtaking city view.Service was also impeccable.
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,14-Nov-14,Five star for the wonderful view of Singapore sky!  I will spare you a lengthy paragraph about the location and views and atmosphere because they were all wonderful. Definitely a must for special occasion.  We had the afternoon tea since we arrived right at 2PM and their kitchen had closed for lunch. Afternoon tea was $30++ which I thought was neither cheap nor expensive. The small bites + coffee/tea weren't anything exceptional. I wouldn't highly recommend them since I believe there are other places with better afternoon tea selection. Go here for the view!
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,16-Mar-15,"Excellent, discreet table service, friendly staff. Servings were pretty generous; food was fresh, courses were well timed, and even the temperature control was perfect. Absolutely no complaints, and most diners around me looked like they were really enjoying themselves. Loved the unusual crab omelette, as well as the yuzu-ginger panacotta dessert."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",4,11-Jan-13,"Confronted by the capturing city skyline, I grew vulnerable at an instant. The breathtaking environ is uncontested, it is no wonder that others called it a romantic spot - I wouldn't refuse such claim. I often get bewitched by the apparent horizon at BLU, I have thought that was the most friendly distance with the clouds until the restaurant was shut last June. While seeing people displaying their portraits taken against the limitless blue plane on various social media platforms, I have secretly bookmarked the place even when there's nothing much to brag about on the food.  Located on the 56th floor at the iconic Ion shopping mall, one has to make his way to level 4 where he will be greeted by a Salt representative at the concierge counter before being transported to the restaurant in a private lift. Clad in stylish layout, pressed table cloth draping the well-aligned tables that sits under the tall ceiling, the space looks so accommodating. The sky bar adjoins Ion's observatory deck will open at dinner time, sets the mood for some romantic engagement. Even if you don't get to sit at the bar during the day, you could walk to the observatory deck for a 360degree view of the city landscape before getting yourself chained to the seat. The service staff are polite and sensitive to your needs. Undeniably knowledgeable on the food composite when I throw questions at her except a fair-skinned white macho who expressed disapproving frown when was told that the asparagus tasted weak under the strong blower in the restaurant.  I was nonetheless impressed with the Fig Tart but less with the crab omelette that many raved about. The brutal kind of tart that you must have, absolutely regrettable if you missed. Get ready to be charmed by that utmost thin and flaky puff pastry - resembles someone with bloated tummy, it was filled with airy compartments packed with overlapping pastry layers that was buttery and so brittle. The sweetness in the fig plus the caramelised onion adds sharp flavour to the puff, together with a smack drizzle of acidic verjuice. I liked the fact that they have been less generous with the blue cheese stuck between the figs and softened onions which may otherwise oust the celestial fit in the dish.  Most people will look for a robust egg dish that is almost always moist, tender yet with a sturdy structure. The Sydney crab omelette met the minimum - not overly cooked (though it could be better if it had been custardy) to hold up the hearty crab filling but taste flat. The spotless golden-yellow structure centred with simple embellishments was seen mediating in the miso broth with a zen outlook.  I chose the asparagus with confit eschallot. I couldn't stressed this much that it looked as if it was a cold dish to me. Others might find the dish positive but it seems less conclusive for me. The crunchy stems were cold and although the shallot confit adds slight flavour, I leave the dish unconsidered.  For the mains, the char grilled corn fed baby chicken fared sumptuously. Endless enjoyment to bits!! Instead of rubbery skin, it turn out thin crisps, splotched by a wider char surface. I love its smokey flavour that scent the fork-tendered juicy meat. While I enjoyed the well-seasoned juvenile drumsticks, I am more fond of the moisture trapped within the succulent meat space! And if you have not eaten a cauliflower puree, this is the time. The whitish pool of creamy cooked texture was laced with some lemon notes which brings out its dedicate flavour. With less added dairy, the puree retained its light fresher taste.  Guaranteeing the best beef from the Northwest of Tasmania, Australia; the Cape Grim has a pronounced wild taste in the meat. Claiming the Australia's finest hormone and GMO-free grass fed beef, it has been well sought after by top chefs world-widely. Going for medium rare preparation, the brownish exterior charred by flat iron encasing the pinkish marbled meat was somewhat appealing. The crust hasn't had the satisfactory bite but the meat texture was tender with a bit of chew. Smudge each piece in the tangy yet pungent verde sauce with tons of flavours coming from chopped parsley, basil, capers and garlic, for very acute taste.  The greatest letdown was the Chocolate Souffl¨¦ which arrived with sheer dampness that I can't live in contention. Yes, it was baked airy in a milder chocolate note but it was all WATERY in the centre, and right to the base!! It seems like alien to me and so I have to summon my genuine feedback when someone came forward to clear my table.  Chocolate Three Ways; the chocolate fondant cake has graced the dessert moment with lingering deep bitter flavour emitting from the moist cocoa sponge. The sweet-toothed wouldn't fancy this but they may find the milk Mars bar a bit more attractive. These desserts didn't quite complete my meal, less memorable. So, if I were to encode anything from Salt, it has to be the splendid horizon plus the entr¨¦e."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",4,2-Apr-16,Nice food n service. The view is great too! A quite place in the busy district. Really enjoy
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,27-May-17,"Dining at @saltgrillandskybar #beautifulplace #wonderfulservice #greatfood starting with tasty chips on the house, followed by insightful knowledge while being served red wine . Restaurant uses #coravin to serve their wine, which helps preserves the wine within the bottle without opening it #genius even the bread served was fragrant & went well with the olive oil & smashed nuts. Before serving the starters, the waitress, Eve, took out a crumber/crumb scoop/crumb picker... whatever you call it, & cleared the bread crumbs from the table with amazing efficiency! The starters continued to impress our taste buds as the shrimp sauce blended nicely with the scallop to deliver a fresh, yet full flavor. It was so good that we wiped it off our plates in the blink of an eye mains came shortly after, & I must say that the pace at which the food was served wasn't too fast, & not too slow, which helped create a great transition between the dishes. Barramundi with prawn tempura for me, & medium tenderloin for Serena. The full dish name was too long & I didn't note it down. The food quality's simply world-class, & I'd love to come back again for special occasions & only for that, cuz the price was more to the steep end!"
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",3,12-Feb-13,"Salt Grill & Sky Bar offers decent food and decent service in an attractive venue with an exceptional view. The venue and view lived up to expectations. The food and service, unfortunately, only lived up to the rather low standards I have come to expect from restaurants on the top floor of tall buildings. Don't get me wrong about this. Their food and service were not bad at all but I was hoping for better.  Next time I want to treat guests to a nice view, I will take them to the Singapore Flyer and then take them to dinner at a great restaurant at ground level that can successfully compete based on the quality of its food rather than its views.  By the way, don't waste your money on the Spanish Ortiz anchovy appetizer. The menu accurately states on that the anchovies are served in the tin with garlic bread but I assumed there would be some creativity involved. There wasn't. Just an open tin of anchovies and some garlic bread.  I'm one of those guys who is useless in the kitchen, but even I could have done that!"
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,24-Aug-14,"I'm very particular about food and it's rare to find such a superb restaurant around these parts! We visited for their Sunday Brunch menu which at $40++ per head including juice and tea/coffee, is very much value for money. The menu only has a few options to choose from, and then you can pick two sides from the list to go with it.  When our food arrived, it looked and tasted divine. I went for the eggs benedict with the smoked salmon gravlax, served with spinach on a couple of their own made crumpets. I chose the wagyu sausage and the pear and blue cheese salad for my sides. I would recommend everything that was on my plate, especially the wagyu sausage!  The staff are very friendly and host a very relaxing atmosphere.  We arrived slightly early and walked around ION Sky. I would highly recommend doing this as the views of Singapore and beyond are fab. If you are unfamiliar with your surroundings, there are signs showing what is where.  The only downside, one which I found a little cheeky, is that if you wish to have a window table, then you must pay an additional $20 for the privilege. I had booked a table for 11am and although the restaurant was pretty much empty, we were sat in the centre of the room. The views are still fab though!  I would definitely return if I ever have the opportunity."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",3,29-Nov-14,"The view was great, but the food was only decent. Not bad, but nothing remarkable for the type of place and price. Overall, presentation was good but taste was mediocre. Would recommend for a date or such event for the view.  I had the steak which was decent but not spectacular considering the price."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,1-Oct-16,We went for their lunch and it was a very good experience.  The price is not bad at all for the taste and presentation!  They also gave us a free desert (additional) as it was my wife's birthday week.  Overall Verdict: 5 Taste: 5 Amount: 4 Price: 4 Atmosphere: 5
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",4,3-Nov-13,"A wonderful fine dining experience from the Luke Mangan stable with the most impressive 180 degree views of Singapore.  Lovely ambience, attentive staff and good food - a crowd pleaser venue that would suit anything from a date night to dinner with the parents."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,11-May-14,"I like to dine with the world under my feet and if you do too, then scoot over to the newly refreshed Salt Grill & Sky Bar at ION Orchard which provides a magnificent landscape of the Orchard Road skyline with their full glass floor-to-ceiling windows that span two storeys high. Swanky it is, Salt grill & Sky Bar serves up some Modern Australian cuisine by celebrity chef-restaurateur Luke Mangan and is known for its one-of-a-kind experience that begins even before guests enter the restaurant. Special concierge reception, private lift, exclusive dining area... it's hard not to feel special here.  Modern Australian cuisine is an intersection of influences from cuisines around the world and i could taste that rightaway in the Amuse Bouche, Coconut broth with Sydney spice. Flavor-wise, it tasted very much like Thai Green Curry without the spice.  We then proceeded with our wine and dine event and our dishes were paired with drinks from the Award Winning New World Wine List of the Year 2013 by the World Gourmet Summit. There is also the signature range of eponymous 'Luke Mangan' wines which are produced in one of Australia's leading wine estates - TarraWarra Estate in Yarra Valley, which Chef Mangan was personally involved in the selection of the grapes and the blending of the wines.  Spring vegetables were served with the mild goats curd, ginger bread crumbs and dried black olives ($31). These are probably sous vide to seal in the freshness of spring.  I love my eggs and the 'Glass' Sydney crab omelette ($33) totally won me over with the precious sheets of runny egg in the center, enoki mushroom and herb salad in miso mustard broth. A generous serving of sweet crab meat was wrapped in the golden parcel. This is certainly a light dish that is refreshing with a basil taste (again, this is almost Thai food).  Signature starters include the Tea smoked quail ($31), an original creation in which the bird is smoked with a combination of earl grey tea and rice, and nicely paired with almond cream, prunes, truffled grains (i believe there is quinoa), grilled shallot, sorrel. There are so many dimensions and flavors to this dish and i was slowly savoring each component. I haven't had prunes in a dish for sometime and it went well with the smokey tender quail.  For mains, we had the Sirloin Rangers Valley, New South Wales, 300 days grain fed Wagyu ($74). Moroccan spice, saut¨¦ spinach, eggplant puree, red wine sauce Wasabi, whole grain mustard. Fantastic aubergine spiced pur¨¦e. Pick your cut from the meat board before having it grilled to your preference (only medium rare for me).  Dessert was pleasantly surprising with Luke's liquorice parfait ($18). I don't quite like licorice but i was amazed at how interesting the flavor and texture worked together especially with lime. You gotta try it for yourself."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",4,22-Feb-15,We went to Salt grill which is my first Australian dining experience in Singapore ever since living there over 4 years.  Took part on contest by a travel company called Jetabout Holidays and got my salt grill dining voucher. Wouldn't really go for fine-dining if not for the fact that I was aware of it. Still valid I think until this week or something when I saw their link http://jetabout.com.sg/gourmet_contest.php  Ordered the pork belly dish and truffle oil french fries as a side dish. They're quite fresh and I especially enjoy the soft chewy & crispy texture of pork with sauce. Quite authentic though I haven't tried the coffee. So it was worth the wait.  I may visit again on a special occasion.
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,4-Dec-15,"The views are beautiful, and yummy steak. The tempura oyster with wasabi was a standout. Service was leisurely, so allow some time."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",4,24-Aug-15,"Incredible venue on top of the ION Shopping Center Tower. The restaurant is two levels, both with panoramic views of the city. Service is great. I started with the Gnocchi appetizer and my guest had the seared foie gras -- both were excellent. For dinner we had the filet and the pork belly. Being American, I'm biased towards American beef. It was good, but not great. I will be back."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",3,30-Apr-13,"Yes, the view of the Singapore skyline is pretty amazing. The tables are not too close together and from nearly every table you have a greater than 180 degree view.  The cocktail menu is pretty comprehensive. I had the 'perfect Manhattan' which was pretty well prepared.  We had a few starters before the mains. While the portions were not large, they were delicious. There was nice spacing between courses.  The service was fairly relaxed, but could have used a little more attention for the prices. I would also expect a few more chef's tasters provided given the price tag. Sure this Singapore, but they can learn some things from other restaurants especially in LA."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",4,24-Feb-14,Very nice view of Singapore.  The food was very good. Good presentation. The steaks are high quality. I was Not as excited about the oysters But what about that view.  I have to knock the service not as it was not too an attentive staff. The prices are very high. But hey what about that view.
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",3,19-Apr-16,"Meh, nothing special, really. I guess the views (if you book early). Otherwise, ok food, ok service, but a bit overpriced."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",4,19-Apr-15,"I wish I had more time here. It's on the 55th floor on ION and it has a spectacular view. I came over for some wine and oysters and was about to have dinner but got a call from my colleagues so I had to rush out. I was unfortunately stuck there with someone who brought in a crying baby that make the experience frustrating but I'm sure they didn't do it on purpose. I didn't have reservations but they took me in I didn't like the location of the bar seating. Overall staff was attentive but sometimes hard to flag down. I would definitely go again, hopefully next time with more time and minus crying baby. Really good wine (but limited selection)"
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",2,24-Sep-15,"Overall: Had we stopped after the first course, this rating would be 5 stars.  The lift lobby and lift are pretty snazzy and in keeping with the 'sky' theme. Entering the restaurant you are greeted with floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall views of the Singapore skyline. Beautiful space, elegant decore, romantic lighting make it a great choice for our first date night in Singapore. When booking I mentioned the occasion and requested window table which we were given though all tables have a skyline view..  We started with a bottle of Mum, the 'glass' crab omelette and the foie gras. The fluffy, delicate omelette was served in a broth that was packed full of flavour. Foie gras became one of my favourite dishes when I visited Budapest. I order it at nearly every opportunity.This version did not disappoint but the plate itself didn't really flow. The perfectly cooked scallop seemed a bit extraneous.  It basically went straight downhill from there. Our mains (snapper and kingfish) were fine but both over cooked. Dessert was ok, Coffees were outrageously overpriced. Service started off acceptable and dropped exponentially over the evening."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",3,3-Oct-15,"The location, view and decor was top class! The service and staff was quite good and the general atmosphere very pleasant. However, you walk through a shopping mall going in and again coming out which somehow lessens the experience (in my opinion) and leads me to wonder why the architects would not have considered having the lift run all the way to the ground floor instead. This is for sure not the fault of the restaurant.  Nonetheless, the food, while being good, is somewhat overpriced. For 70+ sgd for a steak there is an expectation that is not quite matched. Especially as the entrees are not served with much else, and each side dish at 10+ sgd, the costs run high quickly. Having said that the presentation is great as is the wine selection, the amuses bouches and the drinks.  I would absolutely recommend this place to have a drink, some appetizers and enjoy the view, but for a great steak, I would go elsewhere for value-money."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",5,6-Jun-18,Had a great experience. Came here with my colleagues for a team dinner and everyone enjoyed their meal. The views are amazing. I ordered the salmon and it was excellent. The drinks I had here were very good as well.
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",4,3-Jan-16,Expensivo! But food is great and service is good. Sweet location in the middle of town for great tapas!
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",4,30-Dec-15,"Great service, beautiful views, and really solid entrees (we had the wagyu sirloin and filet which were cooked perfectly, along with truffle and parmesan fries). The portions aren't huge but even still the prices weren't too bad considering the usual luxury tax in Singapore. Free veggies w/radish hummus appetizer was a pleasant surprise."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",3,27-Oct-13,A Little late to post. Place is impressive for sure and service excellent but food was perhaps overrated. Taste just did not wow us and yes left with a slight dent in the pocket
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",1,12-Jul-16,"AVOID AVOID AVOID AVOID. Did I say avoid? So, the view is spectacular. No question about it. In the US it is common knowledge that view restaurants always leave something to be desired foodwise. As a general rule. This place - honestly the food is insultingly bad. How a chef could put their name on this crap and sell COOK BOOKS is just astonishing. Mind you, we ordered a lot of food so this wasn't one bad dish. They were all bad. Terrible. Worst I have ever had. Specifically the bone marrow - what the hell is that?? Bone marrow is supposed to be full of flavor. This version tasted like something scraped off of a McDonald's Big Mac. The pork ""medley"" main was awful. Pork belly no flavor. Pork loin over cooked. Rack of lamb? The sauce was better suited for a donut. Meat special (158$ for 2) tasted like a low grade steak from a supermarket. And the dessert? Molten chocolate cake was neither molten nor chocolate. Think crushed up Oreo cookie shaped like a small cake. $22 for that disaster.  If someone invited me to eat here for free, I wouldn't go."
Salt Grill & Sky Bar,4,48,"Modern European, Australian",1,12-Jul-16,"If I could give this place zero star for food, I would do it. The only thing this place has is the view, so if that's what you're after, come and have a drink and go have a dinner else where. Since we were a party of five, we have ordered plenty of different dishes and all of them were tasteless, terribly decorated and nothing resembled of what they should taste like. Gnocchi was dry, burrata was served with a regular bread which was also served with the meal before entree, bone marrow was dry and flavorless. Lamb was bland (how could it be????) with a mismatched buttermilk sauce. I can go on forever because we had about 5 more dish, but I'll stop. Sommelier couldn't make any recommendation under $300 a bottle, dessert we ordered was called 'molten lava cake' came out of some box, not from an oven and had no melted chocolate anywhere inside. This place is obnoxiously bad, bad, bad, bad and bad."
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",4,3-May-24,I'd really give it a 4+.  Amazing concept tying cuisines from around the world and types of foods spaced in different parts of their restaurant...very much like their national hawker centers!  I subtracted 1/2 a star because not all the dishes were tasty. But the amount and breadth of their offerings were appreciated. Definitely worth a try at least once if in Singapore. The restaurant is found right across from the JW Marriott South Beach.
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",5,9-Dec-23,"This place is good with fresh Oisters from japan, juicy and fresh compared to other resto that have oisters. This place overall are good at seafoods. The amount of variety food alot but only one thing is the beef wasnt that good for me. However, they serve turkey. THE DESSERTS i would say very good especially the dark chocolate and most it are not sweet. Service is fantastic as well the ambiance. Pricewise $$. if your seafood eater its worth to spend."
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",4,2-Dec-23,"The ambiance is good, cozy, food are good, service as well, this restaurant is good in seafood. And oisters are really fresh from Japan and sweet compared to other places. On meat side is also good but i dont prefer the beef, they have turkey and ham which good. I recommend this places if you more into seafood."
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",5,6-May-24,"Absolutely fabulous breakfast buffet included with my room at JW Marriott. The variety of foods scatted at stations throughout the restaurant is outstanding: omelette bar, noodle bar, Indian food, Chinese food, salad bar where you cut your own micro greens, fruit, yogurt, dumplings...And everything is both beautifully presented and delicious. I can't wait to go every morning!"

It has everything could every want but be prepared to hike from one side of the large establishments to the other. Chinese selections Indian, Malay options traditional European choices and more"
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",5,17-Jun-19,"Great location with easy access via MRT. Stopped at esplanade station and walk up to enjoy the magnificent architecture of JW Marriott hotel. Check out the fountain with Bruce Lee's quote.  We made a reservation last Feb at BRK to celebrate an engagement this June. Communication with BRK prior to our arrival has been via email and they were responsive and helpful.  On the day of our celebration, we were seated in the area behind the noodles station next to the bar. we had the entire space there and it felt like we had the whole place. The space was beautiful. We had 9 folks around a large table and another table of 6 off to the side. The smaller table was intimate. The large table was comfortable. It was a huge table so trying to have a conversation across the table is not recommended. Plan your seating chart well. It worked out for us.  Food is delicious! There is a huge spread of food from seafood to grill to local delicacies like hainanese chicken rice. Plan your trips well. I think it is impossible to sample everything BRK has to offer but I'm sure they have something for your craving when you get there. Chili crab? Black vinegar trotters? Grilled pork? Noodles? Razor clams? Fresh oysters? They have it all.  I did not eat every item available but our group of 14 came close.  Mathan and his team including Jane was very attentive. Mathan offered to bring grilled fishes to the table to save us waiting. At the end of our meal, mathan and Jane brought out a cake with a candle on it for the couple. That's so thoughtful.  I would recommend Beach Road Kitchen to anyone looking for a buffet meal anytime in a nice part of town."
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",5,6-Dec-18,"I have celiac disease and struggled to find places in Singapore that were safe to eat. As I was staying at the JW Marriott, I was advised to go here and speak to the chef. Chef Sid walked me through the a la Carte menu to help me find a good lunch item. The following morning, he also walked me through the buffet to help me find options.  I had breakfast here each morning of my 6 day stay and was wonderfully surprised to see that the team had added an all new gluten free muffin bar complete with individually wrapped muffins to avoid cross contamination! I was so impressed that Chef Sid took the initiative after learning about the challenges for Gluten sensitive/celiacs to add this offering and to reconfigure their budgets to meet our needs. He was even thoughtful about where he placed it (near fruit, cheese and cold cut sections) so that gluten sensitive customers didn't have to walk near the bread area.  Wow! Thank you Chef Sid!"
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",4,12-Mar-19,"Went here for breakfast, and while a bit pricy it was great. All items were very fresh and the cold section was amazing... felt like I was walking through the fruit and vegetable section at the grocery. Fresh pastries, eggs to order and a good selection with many stations. Coffee and espresso here was great as well. With they included fresh squeezed juice for the price, saw them pouring orange juice from a jug then placing above the oranges in the fresh section."
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",5,9-Mar-18,The BEST brunch I've ever had in my life. No joke. Plenty of different stations to try but hands down my favorite was the fruits station and soup station. And can't forget about freshly squeezed juice. This place has a huge assortment of foods--I craved it so much I had to come back during my limited time here.
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",5,2-Jun-19,"Incredible Sunday birthday brunch...local, Indian, grill, seafood, the Full Monty ... but the service was stellar from servers to baloon lady to station chefs (esp Gana at seafood) to everyone who serenaded my Daughter and gave us special cake. One of best buffets in my 33 years. When the sashimi is Super fresh and tasty it tells you a lot about their standards. Will remember this for Ma y years."
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",5,14-Jul-18,Amazing food. Great service. Anyone from the pickiest eater to a foodie will find something that rocks here.
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",5,10-Aug-19,"Open early around 6am-10am to JW Marriott guests for a full breakfast buffet. The service and food was amazing. Ask for a cappuccino or a latte instead of coffee from the bar although the coffee was great also. The staff is so friendly and ensure that your meal is pleasant. They offer a variety of traditional Asian dishes, fresh fruit, waffle bar, juices, a noodle bar, and freshly made omelettes. I looked forward to this buffet since it was included in the room rental. It would be rather expensive to eat here otherwise."
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",5,6-Jul-17,"At $42 (Sing dollars) plus 17% per person, this place is a splurge that is well worth it as long as you come hungry. The breakfast buffet has a very wide selection of eastern and western cuisine and diverse grouping should all be satisfied. Not to miss: Kaya crepe was exquisite. Fresh young coconut juice was sweet and refreshing. Fresh fruit bar with local and international fruits. Coffee is excellent. They make a good flat white. The chicken congee was very tasty. They make eggs, waffle and crepes to order. There's a noodle and young tau foo bar. And a salad bar. Restaurant is nice--open and relaxing. Service is very attentive. Nasi lemak was good but the otah was mushy and not smoked enough. Curry chicken was excellent. Selection of smoked fish included smoked herring and a number of different kinds of lox. Laksa would be a good addition to the buffet."
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",2,18-Feb-18,"I almost never write poor reviews and count on one hand with fingers to spare the number of times I have sent food back and for the first time in my life have refused to include gratuity.  I came in at just after 11:00 AM on a Sunday looking for some breakfast. The hostess really didn't want me to come in telling me I had to leave by noon because a large party was coming in. ""Fine, I'll order quick."" I got seated and asked about drinks. Flat white and a water, fine. I took a look at the menu, certainly not cheap by stretch but I am on the company dime. I'll get an omelet. Safe, easy, vegetarian. The waitress didn't know what an omelet was even though I was ordering from the menu. She had to talk to the chef twice, I just wanted cheese and vegetables (I even said I didn't care). The chef even came out to find out what I wanted to make sure. Potatoes come with it. Coffee comes.... no water.... waiting...waiting... Out comes the chef with the omelete.... it has sauage on the side. No, that isn't going to work. I said 3 times I was a vegetarian.  Then the omelet comes again, the eggs are scorched. Eggs aren't supposed to be brown. There are 5 tiny potatoes, one of which is bad (brown in the middle), no seasoning.  My water comes.  I am done here.  They send out another waiter to try to smooth things over. I asked, ""Where would you eat?""  At least I got something out of it."
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",4,6-Feb-17,Great breakfast! Like most breakfast buffets in Asia it has a wide range of "stations" ranging from an egg station to a salad bar. Each of the stations were wonderful...except the waffle station. The two mornings I ate there the waffle station was not manned so the only option was a cold waffle. I would imagine that it usually is manned...but since it wasn't manned when I was there I didn't get the change to experience it.
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",5,22-Oct-17,One of a kind! Beautifully presented and the variety is bounty less. A must for brunch while in Singapore.
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",5,9-May-17,"Went here for breakfast as i was staying at the hotel next door and nothing else was open at 6 am, jetlagged. Omg, fantastic spread for breakfast, went straight for the local foods. It was so delish i forgot about getting the usual standby, bacon eggs bagels. Which they had as well. The cappacino was great and included in the price of the buffet. Highly recommend this place. The staff were very nice to boot."
Beach Road Kitchen,4.6,17,"Breakfast & Brunch, Chinese, Buffets",5,10-Jul-17,"Open for dinner, $78 Sing ++. Suggest skip wine pairing. Fantastic seafood room! Great sashimi, crab, smoked salmon, fresh anchovies, ceviche. Veggies good - roasted fennel, asparagus. Fresh papaya superb. Nice evening all in all."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,1-Jan-24,"Nestled within the embrace of The Ritz-Carlton, Colony gracefully unfolds as an epicurean tapestry, weaving a symphony of flavors that tantalize the palate and captivate the senses. Having garnered rave reviews, securing a reservation here akin to snagging a wishbone during the first bite of a Christmas turkey, bordered on the miraculous. My last-minute serendipity, however, paved the way for an experience as extraordinary as the tales whispered of old.  The buffet itself was a symphony of culinary delights. Glistening seafood, nestled on beds of crushed ice, beckoned with their briny allure, while a kaleidoscope of colorful salads promised an explosion of flavors. Plump, jewel-toned cheeses and charcuterie slices of unparalleled finesse awaited alongside steaming baskets of dim sum. For the more adventurous palates, aromatic curries whispered of faraway lands, their spice-laden warmth transporting diners to vibrant Indian bazaars. Those seeking comfort found solace in bowls of freshly prepared pasta, each strand a canvas for vibrant sauces that sang with Italianate passion. A noodle station offered comforting bowls of laksa, the rich coconut broth laced with the fragrant whisper of lemongrass, and steaming bowls of pho, the translucent rice noodles cradling slivers of succulent beef.  And then, there was dessert. A veritable fantasia of sugary delights, it was a playground for the inner child. Tarts, glistening like jewels, held secrets of citrus and cream. Chocolate pralines, each a decadent bite, whispered promises of pure, unadulterated bliss. Waffles, crisp and golden, awaited their baptism in a molten river of maple syrup, while onde-onde, those little orbs of chewy rice cake, offered a delightful textural contrast. Cookies, macarons, pandan cake, and a kaleidoscope of other confections transformed the dessert station into a Willy Wonka wonderland for grown-ups. Each bite was a tiny explosion of flavor, a testament to the pastry chef's artistry.  Of course, no experience is flawless. The tandoori turkey, while flavorful, did veer towards the drier side, a minor misstep in an otherwise flawless performance. The dessert selection, while impressive, could have boasted a wider variety, as could the hot and seafood items. But these were mere whispers of discontent, quickly drowned out by the resounding chorus of delight that played on my palate.  At 88 SGD, or roughly $68 USD, the buffet is an investment. Add taxes and the ever-present nudge of gratuity, and you're looking at a cool 105 SGD, or $79 USD. But for an experience that transcends mere sustenance, that elevates the act of eating to an art form, Colony is worth every penny.  And as for the Ritz-Carlton itself, well, let's just say that its understated elegance might not quite live up to the opulent standards of its younger, flashier counterparts. Think of it as a comfortable old shoe, well-worn but undeniably reliable, rather than a pair of sky-high stilettos that might leave you with blisters at the end of the night.  In the end, Colony's buffet may not be the undisputed champion of Singapore's smorgasbord scene. That crown, for now, rests on the shimmering head of Rise at Marina Bay Sands. But for a delightful, meticulously crafted, and utterly satisfying culinary journey, Colony stands tall, a testament to the fact that sometimes, the most exquisite experiences are found not in the grandest settings, but in the quiet corners, where passion and artistry weave their magic on a plate."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",4,26-Jun-24,"(4.25) ~ Very good Overall dinner Buffet & service. NOTE: Reservations recommended & Smart casual Dress code enforced.  DRINKS: ** Water (tap) = (4) very good, must be filtered;) ** Americano (coffee) = (4) very good * Pineapple Juice = (3.5) good  FOOD: ** ALL Desserts = (4.25) Very wide Selection ** ALL SAVORY = (4) very good. My favorite Savory was Butter Chicken w. Plain Naan"
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,10-Apr-24,This buffet is an absolute must do experience in Singapore! Not only does it highlight Singaporean cuisine it does a great job with its Western offerings as well. Of two particular things to note are the beautiful decorated atmosphere and the staff. They do an incredible job with the plates and beverages but also the congenial manager and assistant manager who were an absolute delight.
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,29-Apr-23,"Colony is one the restaurants inside Ritz. They offer buffet lunch/dinner and afternoon tea. I was looking for a place for afternoon tea when we were visiting Singapore. After I saw their menu, this is the one. I made a reservation online and it was easy. The ""journey"" set included a glass of champagne or cocktail, 6 different savory goodies, unlimited sweets and your choice of tea. The savory items were all very tasty with local twist. They came in good size (not in petite). Our belly were happy and so full. The staff were friendly and the manager also checked on us a couple times. I noticed that they offer limited edition afternoon tea for the season or holiday (lunar new year). Highly recommended!"
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,22-Jan-23,"This is , supposedly, the number one buffet in Singapore right now. It is located inside the Ritz Carlton. I think it came out to about $70~$80 US Dollars. Make a reservation online in order to get in (do in advance by a few weeks).  Seating and Dining Area was beautiful. Definitely a bit more luxurious looking inside than that of any Vegas buffet.  There are a few stations. I believe there is a staggered rush, but only turn the tables over only once maybe. The seafood area is the closest and is in the center of the dining area. There are delicious and huge fresh prawns, crawfish, clams, mussels, some small snow crab claws, and some super tasty oysters from Japan. There's then a sushi area that has some pretty tasty salmon sashimi and a few other assorted sushis. This gets super packed with people wanting to try the seafood first.  Then there's a ""u-shaped"" back area behind the seafood that has a ""roasted meats stall"" that is very decorative, as they have a display case and everything. There's also a pasta station - which makes a pretty good seafood miso carbonara (pretty uniquely tasty). The western area isn't very good imho. The indian station is decent, and someone is making fresh naans. The singaporean/asian area was good -- they have chili crab, which is made with soft shell crab. The noodle station was good , with plenty of tasty prawns in it. The guy working was also super nice. Then there's a dim sum area.  Drink wise, there are some juices (nothing special, coming out of a box and poured into the cups), along with some desserts. There's a dessert station near the front which had a lot of good stuff from local kuey to macaroons.  Give it a try if you're in SG. A good variety of stuff , high quality, and has a good balance of SG classics and non Singaporean stuff."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",4,11-Nov-23,"One of the best buffets in Singapore, you get an amazing area of dishes across both western Asian cuisines. The service is impeccable, and the ambience is really good as befits a ritz."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",4,2-Jul-22,"Colony is THE place for good quality lunch buffet in Singapore. Yesterday was not my first visit but after all these years, pre pandemic and we are still in a pandemic, the price remained somewhat the same. Personally I find the $64 per pax for a lunch buffet reasonable. So after many visits to Colony, what did I notice?  FOOD 4/5 The Chinese section (dim sum) of the buffet remained the same. As in, they were not good. They never improved since my first review here. If those dim sum was the same served at their Chinese restaurant Summer Pavilion, rest assured I would never go there for dim sum.  So let's name a few items I had: Fried Fish (The Wok section) - the batter was chewy, the fish was somewhat fishy. That's a no for me.  Prawns with veggies (can't remember the name, also The Wok section) - 5/5 love it! The prawns were huge and very fresh.  Chicken Radish Soup 5/5 So good!! Tasted like what my mom made in the past.  Seafood Ramen 4/5 not bad but where were the seafood?  Lucky for the patrons at Colony, i do not eat cold seafood, cooked or uncooked. They were standing in line and looking so pleased. I walked past the seafood section, two thumbs up cos they looked very fresh. Good for those who enjoyed them!  Chicken Rice -4/5 Good, they nailed the rice of course and poached chicken was soft and tender.  Bread & Butter 5/5 - Onion roll was amazing! The butter was as good as MEGGLE, my personal fav.  Dessert (Lychee Rose, Mango Pudding, Tiramisu, Pandan Gula Melaka cake and Green Tea tart) - 5/5 I enjoyed every bit of it.  Mango juice was so so good!!! 5/5  What to improve?? Pre pandemic their Western section was so good. In fact, that section was my favorite of all. They did away and set up a Grill & Rotisserie section. I found the items unexciting. Sorry!  AMBIANCE 5/5 Always love the ambiance at the Colony!! Lots of natural lighting.  SERVICE 5/5 ***** Solid 5 stars!! I never had a bad service at Ritz Carlton. Yesterday was another wonderful service provided by their staffs. Jane, Carmela and Kelly were very nice but the MVP went to Iraj. Iraj was very attentive, polite and friendly from the start to finish. He constantly cleared our used plates, checking in on us throughout the lunch, refilling our water. Iraj is the epitome of top notch service at a 5 star hotel.  I took my bestie out for lunch since I have not officially took her out to celebrate her acceptance to Stanford. Iraj brought out a beautiful fruit platter with candle and a piece of chocolate saying ""Congratulations!""  Many thanks Iraj! Look forward to seeing you the next time I visit Colony!!"
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",4,29-Jun-19,"Another day, another lunch..  My girlfriend and I made plans to come here for a buffet lunch. She was the one in charge of making reservation. After all, her dear friend was still fighting some Jet-Lag demon which never want to go away. She texted me and highlighted about the dress code. LOL!! I assured her there were no tees or shorts in my suitcase. And flip flops? I know better, and she should know that ;P  So everyone, note there is a dress code at The Colony and I hope everyone stick to that dress code, not only out of respect for the restaurant but also out of respect for your fellow patrons as well.  I arrived 10 mins before noon. The staffs were busy, prepping for the lunch that starts at noon. My girlfriend showed up and we just waited around the entrance, and soon one staff came and checked us in. I supposed one should definitely not try to walk-in in order to dine here. By this time, the restaurant started to fill up with a lot of people who were all here for the buffet. It was a far cry from 10 minutes ago when it was so calm and quiet.  AMBIENCE 3/5  I really like the ambience. I like the natural light flowing in from outside and how bright the whole place is. Then what went wrong?  1) There were some tiny fruit flies at the restaurant. One was ""drinking"" the water condensation on one of our glasses (but not before I ended it :( ) and my friend & I each have taken the lives of one of those insects on our table.  2) This is probably not the fault of the restaurant but I was not thrilled when there were so many noisy and unruly kids at the restaurant. They were goofing around their table and I was so worried my bowl of piping hot noodles would end up on their heads. Trying to make my way back to my table with a plate of hot food while trying not to get bumped into by these kids, I did not need that kind of stress. To all those who like to dine at The Colony and planned to bring your kid(s), if your kid (s) can't behave and you can't control your kid(s), please for the love of god, do not bring them there.   FOOD 4/5  The buffet was divided into many sections. There was the Chinese, Japanese, Local, Cold Cuts, Seafood, Indian, Juices/Drink stand, etc..  I have to say The Colony did not fare well on the Chinese food section. Just to point out a few:  1) Char Siew Pau (BBQ pork bun) - non fluffy and the filling was so dry 2) Shrimp Dumpling - Filling was not tasty, the skin though soft was funky 3) Chicken Siew Mai (Chicken dumpling) - not tasty 4) BBQ Pork Ribs - looked absolutely delicious, but they were so tough. I made better ribs, enough said.  There were a few things which I absolutely love or like, 1) beef (not sure what it was called) - so soft and 100% yummy! 2) Golden Pineapple Rice - not bad at all 3) Herbal Chicken Soup - wonderful 4) Blueberry Iced Tea - think I had like 3-4 glasses. So refreshing!!  What could be better? 1) The Chinese food section of course. Cook those ribs longer please. 2) Pastries. They were alright but I expect better.   SERVICE 5/5 Staff was attentive and our water was constantly refilled. Plates were removed very promptly. New cutlery was given every time we were done with our food. I was absolutely happy with that. Most restaurants let one reused their cutlery. I hate putting used fork and knife on the table. However, one question? Why did many other tables were served with coffee or tea?? No one came to ask us if we like to have coffee or tea ;( Hmmm.."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",3,13-Apr-22,"Very average dining experience. Not much explanation was given - it's all buffet style with water/tea/coffee served by the waiter(esses). For 48 SGD I almost expected a bit more. The choices are between pancakes, omelette bar, dim sum, chirashi bites, eggs benedict, an assortment of small breads, salad bar, fruits and juices, and a few curries. Not one of my most favorite ritz breakfast experiences, but it works if you don't want to leave the hotel."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,1-Oct-22,One of my favorite places to bring my friends and family when we want buffet. Excellent fresh food and stellar service. Pre-Covid we can walk around and look at all the wonder food in display. Post Covid is sit down menu buffet. They will bring you all the food requested.
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,22-Dec-18,"This buffet was worth every dollar spent!  My wife and I celebrated our 1 year anniversary (and part of our honeymoon) at Colony and it was everything I read about it and more. Buffets are typically unattractive gorge-fest atmospheres filled with gluttony and sloppiness everywhere, but Colony puts a whole new spin on it. The restaurant puts other buffets to shame, adding a major touch of classiness and romanticism to it all.  The restaurant is located in the Ritz-Carlton hotel and can easily be found in the lobby. Customers are first greeted by the Patisserie section, with its delectable collection of pastries and desserts, before making their way onto the dining area. After a quick glance, one might even want to skip straight to dessert -- that is, until they lay their eyes on one of the other 6 sections of the buffet.  Besides the Patisserie, there's the following sections, which are all connected to one another:  ICE BAR - Jumbo shrimp cocktail, snow crab legs, raw oysters, mussels, craw fish, sashimi, sushi, etc. GRILL & ROTISSERIE - Grilled ham, brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes, sausage, squash, kale, etc. STEAM BASKET - Steamed dim sum, buns, ready to made hot pot food, fish balls, noodles, etc. WOK - Chinese/Malay cuisine, such as, steamed fish, chili crab, fried rice, prawns, ribs, vermicelli, etc. TANDOOR - Indian cuisine, such as, various curries, basmati rice, etc. FRUIT STALL - Juices and whole fruits  I probably did not come close to naming every single food that was served in each section, but it should give any hungry person an idea prior to walking in. I can't fit a comment here on every single item, but to summarize, the seafood was extremely fresh, the sushi was great for a buffet, the hot foods from the Chinese/Malay/Indian cuisine sections were very tasty. We didn't find a single thing wrong with anything we ate. By far the most attractive section though was the Patisserie. The assortment of pastries and little desserts here and there were fantastic and any dessert lover's dream. It really gave us the opportunity to sample away because they were small enough.  Yes, the buffet is $88 per adult for dinners .. and it's totally worth it with the amazing selection and chill atmosphere. Buffets aren't typically thought of as date restaurants, but Colony really redefines what a buffet is. On top of it all, our waiter was excellent. He knew we were here for our honeymoon and even gave us a quick tour of the buffet when we arrived so we wouldn't get lost. The perfect buffet? If it's not, it's damn close to it."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,20-Dec-18,"My favorite champagne brunch spot in Singapore! It use to be called the Greenhouse. The same space was renamed Colony, but the all you can drink and eat decadent buffet is pretty much the same.  As expected of a champagne brunch in Singapore, it has a full raw bar, plenty of charcuterie, a nice cheese selections, some dim sum, pasta and noodle stations, a roast of some sort, breakfast items, soups, salad bar, and a variety of desserts. You can eat for days, but you only have a few hours to gobble down all this goodness, nevermind the free flow vintaged brut or rose champagne and Bloody Marys.  Champagne brunch in Singapore is not a meal, it's an event, so bring an empty stomach and some great friends and prepare to have an amazing time getting stuffed on food and drink!"
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",4,30-Apr-19,"It's a promising buffet, but like buffets food in general is good, but never excellent. They do offer a good variety of food. Noodle stand, dim sum, Chinese bbq, pizza, burgers, cheese table, sushi, seafood (king crab legs, shrimp, oyster) big dessert area with different chocolates, ice cream and cake. Even nitro infused dessert made on the spot. Last thing a juice bar. It was a bit pricey, but with the selection it's fair. Dining area is good size and service was attentive."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,20-Mar-20,"Absolutely loved dining at Colony! I was warmly greeted and shown to my table, and on the way set my eyes on the beautiful buffet. The restaurant itself is tastefully designed and the lay out of the buffet flows nicely. The selection is wonderful and clearly makes sure to incorporate local dishes. Naturally, I sampled as much as I could and was pleasantly surprised to have found everything to be delicious-from experience often not the case in buffet style dining. The steamed salted egg bun, specifically, was phenomenal and is a must try. Every individual I encountered working at Colony was exceedingly friendly, and one of the chefs even posed the steamer baskets so that I could take a nice photo with the salted egg buns. I'll be visiting again on my next trip to Singapore!"
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,4-Mar-19,"I absolutely loved this buffet.  I came here for everyday for breakfast and lunch. I'd say the lunch is more spectacular than the breakfast spread.  They have sushi, Singapore food, juices, meats/cheeses, Chinese food, Indian food, a whole bread station, and a beautiful dessert section. Lunch is special because you can get crab legs."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",4,27-Sep-18,"The crowd, as expected in a hotel, is all tourists. Sometimes gems can be discovered in unexpected places. Despite the aging Ritz Carlton starting to appear more like an average Marriott than a Ritz, The Colony restaurant inside was a treat both in design and quality.  Stepping into this uniquely designed space, there is a sense of surprise and confusion. The confusion arises from the vastly dispersed food selections throughout, making the breakfast appear endless. The dividers, decorated with antiques and imagery of Singapore provide a museum like feel to what would otherwise be a buffet. Selections are very vast, making it difficult to make a decision. Every piece of the meal was amazing, with the exception of one dish, the chicken curry in the Malay section which was not prepared well and the chicken very dry.  The service was spectacular and the buffet selections even beat out The St Regis where we spent the last evening in Singapore. Sitting next to the bamboo garden here is very relaxing and the building provides a fair share of natural light.  So, don't get discouraged by the otherwise sad looking architecture of this building and the cramped, boring entrance into the property, this restaurant is a must for luxurious breakfast."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",4,6-Jun-16,"In one word ""Awesome!""  So much variety.  So much food.  Good quality food.  Make a reservation since it was quite well patronised even on a Sunday.  There's lobster ball noodles (really it is like a fishball), duck and chicken rice, Northern Indian food and naan and papadam, leg of lamb and the usual suspects etc.  Desserts - A wide variety of desserts, ice cream and I especially like the broken chocolate pieces (like La Maison's mendicant but only with nuts).  Overall a good meal. Good service too."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,18-Jun-18,"This place was excellent, exactly what you would expect from a high quality buffet. It had mainly Malay, Chinese, and Indian food and every bit of it was so delicious. I started off with the laksa which is one of my favorite dishes I have had in Singapore, then transitioned into the heavier foods. They have a great spread of cold cuts, pat¨¦, and jam¨®n ib¨¦rico, aside a large selection of cheeses to choose from. Their sushi selection is not too extensive but it does have the main crowd favorites: salmon, tuna, yellowtail. They have both sashimi and nigiri, as well as a few simple sushi rolls to choose from. They had a great seafood selection and delicious fresh oysters too!  I loved their salted egg chicken wings! They taste exactly like salted egg and are so so good! Very crispy on the outside and bursting with flavor, I wish I had gotten more. They also have a unique selection of bread, the wheat and seaweed ones were my favorite.  The desserts were one of my favorite parts of the buffet! There was every kind of pastry imaginable, and you bet your ass I tried them all! Lol my favorites were the Carmel br?l¨¦e, truffles, and gelato. But there are so many more I am probably not remembering so be sure to give them all a taste, they are small portions so as long as you pase yourself you should be fine.  The service was just as good as the food. Our server was cheetah, I apologize I I spelled that incorrectly. He was very attentive and checked up on us very frequently to clear our plates. This place was a great experience but keep in mind it is very expensive. We ordered all you can drink which was about $40 per person; there were three of us and we totaled over $400. But this was for a special occasion and they even brought out a candle and a plate with not one, but FULL of different pastries to sing me happy birthday!"
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,18-Mar-16,"Great setup for breakfast and dinners, broad range of cuisines, fresh tuna and salmon sashimi, salads, chicken, duck, pork, lamb, beef, fish, prawns, crab, in addition to a range of Indian, Malay and Chinese dishes. The desert range is fantastic, in addition to ice cream and chocolate bars, not bad for $70!  Ahi tuna, salmon sashimi is very fresh, braised red snapper is firm yet supple, tandoori chicken spiced just right and the tiny sesame naans are but tasty."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,7-Dec-15,"Great setup for breakfast and dinners, broad range of cuisines, fresh tuna and salmon sashimi, salads, chicken, duck, pork, lamb, beef, fish, prawns, crab, in addition to a range of Indian, Malay and Chinese dishes. The desert range is fantastic, in addition to ice cream and chocolate bars, not bad for $70!"

Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,9-Feb-16,"High-end hotels in Singapore know how to buffet.  Colony is at The Ritz Carlton and $88++ for dinner here is a STEAL.  What makes Colony unique is that they not only have an impressive western selection, but they have dedicated stalls that specialize in Singaporean cuisine. You can easily get famous dishes such as chicken rice, chilli crab, dim sum, laksa (with lobster!), and Indian food here. Everything is high quality, but if you're a tourist here, I still recommend that you go outside and try all these at their respective restaurants for a more authentic experience.  As a resident here, I decided to focus on their western spreads. Of course, I loaded up on all the fancy cheeses and charcuterie. I really enjoyed their roast, along with all the curries in the Indian section. The desserts also had a western focus, with things like cookies, ice cream sundaes, and pies, though they did have some nice kuehs to choose from.  Considering the ambiance and price, this is a great place to go for special occasions with the family, or celebrating a milestone birthday or job promotion with friends who are picky!"
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,31-Jan-16,"There are buffets and then there are BUFFETS! The Colony at the Ritz Carlton is a buffet you literally dream about. At some point during the buffet, I literally thought I was stealing. The SGD88 price per person vs. the collection of food offered is simply absurd!  First the seafood bar is out of this world. What buffet offers three types of oysters: Canadian, French and Irish so customers can different tasting oysters from sweet to salty to creamy to everything in between. Wow! Obviously, these oysters are air flown from where ever they are located in the world, so don't expect absolute freshness. Nevertheless, it was more than satisfying. Next to the oyster baskets are whole crabs, half cracked lobster claws (the ones you find in Maine), mussels, clams. Honestly, I couldn't contain myself. No where in Singapore can eat 3 whole lobsters and a dozen oysters in one sitting and not break the bank.  Other than the seafood bar, there was a sushi/sashimi bar, Indian buffet, Chinese / Singaporean buffet. Other note worthy dishes included: all you can eat Chilli Crab Claws, butter grilled half cut lobster tails, XO fried rice.  The Ambience is great, perfect for a Friday night date, and service is impeccable. A must try, indeed!"
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,30-Dec-16,"Christmas ""Hope"" log cake ($88) - 5 stars Dark Chocolate Ganache, Hazelnut Biscuit, Gianduja Cr¨¦meux, Raspberry Mousse, Gel¨¦e This was pricey but absolutely delicious! The cake wasn't too sweet and the flavors (chocolate, raspberry and hazelnut) and textures (the silky smooth cremeux, melt-in-your-mouth mousse, and crunchy hazelnut) complemented one another perfectly. Not to mention the fact that the cake was absolutely gorgeous, with gold dust, glittery gold streaks against the sheen of chocolate ganache, and dark chocolate shapes that tasted divine. I couldn't ask for more in a dessert. Best enjoyed at tea time with a cup of black coffee, because I'm usually too full after dinner and wouldn't be able to appreciate it."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",3,2-Dec-15,"After a six-month period renovation, the all-time popular buffet restaurant arm of The Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore, opens with a new concept and name called ""Colony"", which draws inspirations from the rich heritage of Singapore's colonial history. What could be better to relish an authentic afternoon tea experience than having a traditional British style three-tier afternoon tea set here?  In fact, decor is a key draw here.I was instantly attracted to the eclectic settings when I stepped in. Adorned on the walls and partitions are old maps, photographs, alongside with vintage black-and-white crockery which I secretly wished I could bring some back home.  In line with the concept of the restaurant, there is some local twist to what would otherwise be a strictly English tea. The golden raisins and plan scones, baked in-house, was served with scented Kaya jam, clotted cream and lemon curd, which somehow reminds me of a delicious Kaya toast when I put everything into my mouth. The second deck and third deck feature an assortment of sandwiches and sweet pastries, including a entire slab of peppered foie gras on beef pastrami! Simply too indulgent!  But if you jumped to the conclusion that it is the usual mixed of sweets, savouries and scones, then you are wrong. It includes a plate of incredibly fluffy savoury pancake, topped with sour cream and French caviar for that touch of luxe.  And when it comes to tea, it's serious business here. Go for the signature brew called Colony Tea, a custom blend of black and white Sumatran tea leaves from Tea Bone Zen Mind that is soothing without any bitter or harsh tang.  The most unique aspect is the addition of flavored syrup such as French Rose, Ginger, Lavender, Palm and Cinnamon, Pandan and Pineapple to enhance the tea. They work to tease out the nuances of the tea and create a therapeutic experience as one slowly sips along with the light bites.  Available daily except Sundays, this afternoon tea also comes with a glass of Moet & Chandon Brut Imperial Champagne. Indeed, Colony doesn't only set itself apart from other local high tea by virtue of its nostalgic charm, the quality of food and tea are highly accomplished as well.  If you favour both substance and style, this would fit the bill."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,10-Apr-18,Easily the highest quality buffet with so many options that I have ever been to.  This is the only buffet I have been to on multiple occasions that has been consistently high quality. A bit of dim sum with some Indian curry and some roast duck and some sushi. Top it off with a solid champagne and this place is everything. Desserts are phenomenal and I love that they make sure they have a local twist to most of them.  It's a great setting that everyone truly walks away happy. I highly recommend for an excellent Sunday brunch.
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,6-Jan-17,"Probably one of my favorite buffet spots in the city! Lovely colonial settings, with a wide variety of meats, cheeses, warm charcuterie, desserts! Food's delicious and the drinks are well balanced. I've spent my birthday here, brought friends here and if I could afford the calories I'll be back sooner!  Also when you're stuffed, walk about the lobby of the Ritz and admire the whimsical glass creations from Chihuly. I love Chihuly."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",2,17-Jan-19,"I used to like to go to Ritz Carlton's Colony restaurant for its buffet. We went to colony this Monday. The restaurant was not full house though. However we were given a make shift squeezed table of Five by a service staff Nina. At first she refused to change table for us, saying that the table is ok with 5 people and the restaurant was fully booked. We told her to call for the manager,then she agree to change to another proper table for 5 persons. The food in the Colony is getting very boring with declining quality. The Japanese counter sashimi and sushi are the standard offerings with no creativity. The color and presentation of food were not attractive. The worst is at the Chinese counter. The dim sum was terrible with no quality control. The texture of dim sum was either rubbery and the Sui Mai texture was soft and starchy with no prawn and meat texture. The Laksa noodles gravy does not taste like Laksa at all. The gravy was over cooked with a burnt taste. The dessert counter was boring and there were no outstanding desserts at all. Just average quality with variety. I was not even tempted to take any dessert when I pass by the dessert counter. Service was excellent apart from the Host blunder in table assignment. I realized nowadays 6stars hotel like Ritz Carlton, Fullerton, due to their reputation and good business , have ignored their initial brand promise to customers. They are sitting on their laurels because the numbers are good and get carried away with food quality and presentation of food. No use of providing wide variety of food, if as a six star hotel restaurants is unable to deliver a 6star professional attitude towards its operations in quality, presentation and innovation of the food offerings to your customers! I realized the so called 6 star hotel restaurants in Singapore cannot be compared with those in Thailand and Hong Kong! The owners of 6 star hotels needs to shake up the hotel management staff and constantly keep them in checked to deliver the brand promise and commitment to their customers !"
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,26-May-17,"This place is spectacular! It will cost you a pretty penny but the seafood is amazing! Oysters, shrimp, prawns, omfg I was in seafood heaven. THAT IS JUST ONE STATION!  They also have the famous Singapore Hainan Chicken with rice but you have to ask for it at one of many stations. Just thinking about this place reminds me of the deliciousness."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",4,2-Jun-16,"This is a review for a Sunday buffet brunch at Colony restaurant, main level of the Ritz Carlton. Formerly branded as the Greenhouse, the Ritz has put much thought and effort into reorganizing the buffet areas into a more consolidated and efficient operation. They've also changed the feel of the dining room by adding partition walls that display framed stock photos all with the theme: colonization.  The effect of the heavily used partition wall modules is that of a Pottery Barn store. The feel is that all of the framed photos are on display to sell. The only thing missing are the price tags. The Wall Modules break up the large space creating a more intimate dining experience. What is lost is the joy of people watching during the brunch. With the serving stations all moved to a remote (mostly hidden) location at the rear of the restaurant and the partition walls segmenting the space into smaller dining areas, the feel is not as good as the Greenhouse.  The wide spectrum of food offerings are enough to please any palette. Local, Indian, Western, Seafood, Cheese, Breads, Desserts, etc. In addition to the free flow champagne, bartenders are on duty to make Bloody Marys and Espresso Martinis. I had several of each and both were delicious.  The staff is friendly, well trained and attentive. Champagne glasses were always kept full, empty plates continually cleared, and Bloody Marys and Martinis delivered upon request.  The Good: Food Quality, Staff, Ambiance  The Bad: I'm not a fan of the maze-like new partition wall modules that detract from the grand architectural space and prefer the more open and spacious feel of the Greenhouse. Hands down, the Greenhouse was a much better brunch experience.  The Verdict: Colony is a prime player in the Singapore Sunday Brunch scene. Glad to have visited, but I think I'll wait for the bi-annual ""Super Brunch"" before returning."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",4,12-Apr-19,"High quality buffet with Ritz-Carlton service: good food, great selection, especially for the Sunday brunch, and pricy."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",4,20-Feb-19,"Food was great, services staff were being really friendly and really helpful with anything we need. My favorite Part of the buffet was talking to the chef. Chef Anthony was being helpful and kind to introduce us to different places to eat in Singapore during our stay at Ritz Carlton. Really enjoyed our dinner on Monday. A few dishes to try, (lobster, Indian food, Chinese cuisine and the seafood.)Enjoy my time and meet some lovely chef and services staff."
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,28-Sep-17,This is one of the best hotel buffet i have ever been. Great quality of food. The seafood like oysters shells crab legs are really fresh. Also like the roast beef and India cuisine there. Will definitely come back. Worth the price.
Colony,4.5,32,"Indian, Chinese, Malaysian",5,6-Jul-17,"One of the best buffets I've tried in Singapore. They have a wide selection of seafood! Alaskan king crab and the oysters are to die for! They also have a wide variety of meats, cheese and I also love the Chinese herb soup they served! The ambiance was perfect and the service is excellent! We got very good service from Cory, the Assistant Manager. Natalie was the food server who assisted us. Both were superb and made us not only love the food but also love their service. I love it so much that i went back in less than a week that I visited Singapore!"
Souper Tang,,,,4,24-Jun-16,"Yummy To The Last Drop!  I'll be honest, prior to seeing people rave about it and seeing my friends post about it on Facebook, I've never heard of Souper Tang. Originally known as Taang Shifu, Souper Tang is one of Malaysia's most popular chain of Soup restaurants with 15 outlets located in Malaysia, with most being in KL and Johor.  Since I'm a soup person (my Grandmother is Cantonese after all), I had to give this place a try and what's more perfect than piping hot soup on a cold and rainy day.  First impression? Not very good. Felt that the duty manager was rude and a bit arrogant when I asked for a menu and he snobbishly answered ""ÒªµÈÂú¾Ã°¡"" (It'll be a long wait).  We only ended up waiting about 10 minutes and thankfully, the other duty manager was a lot friendlier. First of.... They have more than 10 soups to chose from... (I think it was 13? 14?). Some soups are individually served (Scholar Excellence Soup) while others were for 3-4 pax (Chinese Cabbage Pork Knuckle Soup with Shimeiji Mushrooms). Since there was 2 of us, we went with the only soup with a 2 pax option, their Signature Soup.  Souper Tang Signature Soup ($26.90) Soup didn't take too long to arrive (about 10-14 mins) and most importantly, it arrived Hot! Nothing irritates me more than being served supposedly hot soup that's barely luke warm but we had no such problem here.  The initial fragrance was nice. Lightly herbal and fragrant. The soup itself started light too. First it tasted like chicken broth that was lightly herbal but as you move down, the distinctive taste of the ginseng, mushroom and chicken slowly comes through. Once you hit the bottom, you'll get that very tasty burst of flavour from the dry scallops used. The GF's not a big fan of soups but this was one of the rare soups she fought with me till the very last drop.  And for those who do not like Herbal Soup, don't worry, the soup isn't over powering with herbal taste (though we've yet to try the rest).  With a large chicken leg (thigh and drum), mushrooms, pork belly and fish maw, this bowl of soup with 2 bowls of rice was enough to fill us.  Osmanthus Red Dates Tea ($4.90) This was a nice drink to go with our soup. It wasn't too sweet, very refreshing and it didn't cancel the soup out in anyway.  Caramel Beancurd ($3.50) This was so so so yummy! The Beancurd was rich, smooth, silky and the bitter sweet caramel added a nice dimension to the dish. Definitely a very good way to end our dinner!  Overall, the prices here are definitely steeper than what you'll get in Malaysia (duh) but it was worth it! We'll be back to try their other soups soon!  However, fans of very strong herbal soups? This might not be your place of choice as the soups here (the one we've tried) doesn't over power you with herbs but leaves a light lingering goodness."
Souper Tang,,,,5,2-Apr-17,"If you love Mee suah, here is the place to come and try. There are variety of soups that are really nice. Finish off with the caramel Beancurd ---it Is a must try"
Knots Cafe & Living,4.3,7,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",4,20-Nov-20,A stylish cafe in the Paya Lebar area that also sells various plants and other lifestyle items in addition to serving up some great food. I tried the salmon sandwich with grilled pineapple which was very tasty. Also had a freshly squeezed glass of orange juice that was good. The decor is very nice but beware this place is super popular to making a reservation is advisable.
Knots Cafe & Living,4.3,7,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",4,30-Dec-17,"I ordered their Parma Ham Benedict to try which cost me $16.90 My colleague ordered their vegetarian pasta. My parma ham benedict is tasty. Filing too. Ambience is nice too. There is a big t.v. on the wall, a lot of flowers and furniture. Realised that they are under Xpressflower too as their staffs are wearing Xpressflower logo. Definitely will come back again for more."
Knots Cafe & Living,4.3,7,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",4,23-Apr-17,"I would love to give the place 5 Yelp stars but because the food only deserves a 3, I will settle with 4 Yelp stars after ""agonising"" about it for quite a while.  1. The garden theme  The Interior decor gets a 4.5 stars: The garden-themed cafe is beautifully decorated with lots of plants & flowers, making it a little sanctuary with all the cute ornaments and knick knacks you can find all around the cafe.  It is really perfect for couples or friends to have cosy get-togethers here. Unlike other cafes, the space is big! 2 storeys all in all, and the space between each table is of a good distance! No fear of people eavesdropping on your conversation, unless of course, you speak really loudly :p  2. Florist  This place is owned by Xpressflower.com, a long established florist chain with 16 outlets in SG (I found that out from their website).  There is a cold room with lotsa flowers inside. It's quite fun to peek through the glass window and see what flowers they have for that day.  Very handy if you intend to just pick up some flowers to decorate your home or get a bouquet for that special someone after a meal here.  3. Furniture store  Knots is also a furniture store! Everything you see, even the chair u sit on is for sale. Who knows? I may just decide to buy one one of these days. I was really quite taken with the round wooden table and chairs we sat on during yesterday's dinner. Let me think about it lol #wink  4. Food  Unfortunately, this cafe really needs to do much better when it comes to their food. Last night was my 3rd visit and I must say I was pleasantly surprised that the dinner we had was much much better than the ones I had with my friends in the first two visits.  5. Reasonable price (value for money)  Fortunately, the prices at Knots are really reasonable. Our dinner last night set us back around $35 for our 2 mains. That's really ok by SG standards where foods in many similar cafes can be quite expensive.  So, for all the reasons above, I will keep coming back to Knots Cafe in the years to come. If only they improve on their food quality, I will happily write a new review and change my rating to 5 stars.  Review 11/50 of 2017 reviews"
Knots Cafe & Living,4.3,7,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",4,6-Oct-18,Kept seeing this in my Facebook feed so decided to try it this morning. Lovely place with eclectic furnishing. Food was ok. It was a bit hot though. Will come back.
Knots Cafe & Living,4.3,7,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",5,24-Jun-18,"Great ambience and not too crowded. Pretty decorations and you can buy them. You can even get fresh flowers over the counter, who weekdays free delivery! Open till late and nice cakes and pastries. Family breakfast would be the best time"
Knots Cafe & Living,4.3,7,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",4,28-Aug-18,"Love the food and the ambiance. From the outside, the building looks like another furniture mall. One have to look closely to see that it's a cool quaint cafe. The decor of home furnishings are all with tags which is for sale. I've been back a few times and they have not disappoint."
Knots Cafe & Living,4.3,7,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",5,16-Feb-19,Love all the greenery and decor - a comforting and refreshing space that pairs nicely with the food they serve here. The kid's meal was a delight to the little one and includes a baby chino and a scoop of ice cream. Will I be back? Hell yeah!
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,5,24-Dec-19,"The Naked Finn  Well known for its seafood for dinner which I have tried many times before. Always good especially their cold vermicelli, prawns & tiny squids.  Had lunch here for the first time. Limited menu; both seafood & local food.  Lobster roll was good. Lobster was not overcooked."
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,5,31-Oct-17,"Naked Finn has a bar called Nekkid nearby.  Keep seeing my hairdresser posting all the yummy food from here. Finally had it last Saturday night.  Good food.  Nice ambience.  5 of us shared one Set (a) and one Set (b). Was enough food.  Liked the kang kong, loved crispy squid, the bee hoon and the scallop carpaccio.  Barramundi Fish was good.  Prawn with the sauce was good but not great although the waiter seemed to think they were great."
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,4,26-Dec-20,The place was quite difficult to book even for a weekday lunch. The place was full when I tried to book online with the next available slot more than a week later. I tried calling the restaurant and managed to get a slot at 12noon with a need to return the table at 12.45pm.
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,4,7-Jul-13,"Love the space. If anyone remember Klee (now defunct cocktail bar that was too early for its time) at Portsdown Road, this place reminds me of it, except that it is way more than just a cocktail bar.  We hiked down to Gillman Village, firstly to get a drink, plus to try out the prawn vermicelli that received a glowing review in the Straits Times. The prawn vermicelli is served as a supper menu item, from 10pm on weekdays and 10.30pm on weekends. The prawn broth is made by frying amaebi shrimps and Sakura ebi, then simmered in pork stock for 7 hours. When served, the server will reiterate that there is absolutely no sugar or seasoning added. Your bowl of yumminess is served with 4 choices of grilled shrimps (banana, giant tiger, gamba espanola, gamba carabinero) on the side. You are also given a condiment tray: sea salt, Japanese spice, chilli powder, plus get this......pork lard made from iberico jamon.  All those of course comes with a price. We went with the gamba espanola, which has a large head that comes with the most amazing roe. Slurp it all up from the head and you are in gamba haven. The flesh of this shrimp is not firm like our usual shrimps, but the taste of the roe more than made up for it. One of this shrimp comes in at $15 on their ala carte menu...  Other dishes we had: - diver-caught Atlantic scallops cerviche - while it was awesome, it is also much too expensive at $20 for two bite size portion. I understand that this will cost much more at a sushi restaurant, but still... - grilled baby Indian squids - so good. Done in all natural goodness without batter so you really taste the succulent juiciness and with a slight smokey crispness at the edge. I can eat this forever. - pan-fried fish. Can't remember which fish we had but it came with an awesomely crispy skin.  Started off with some very fruity cocktails. All the cocktails are deliciously fruity yet strong. The kyoho grape one is full of the beautiful notes of this amazing fruit, pulp included so that you are sure this is the real deal. Strangely, the drinks are served kind of ice-blended, so you do get a brain freeze if you drink it immediately.  Menu is strictly seafood. If you are allergic to seafood, or looking for meats, avoid this place. The pricing is on the high side but they pride themselves on quality seafood."
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,5,6-Jan-13,"They serve the BEST cocktails you can ever find in Singapore!  I love the fact that they live up to their name of being ""naked"", for the fact that the ingredients used in the choice of seafood are simply salt, pepper and olive oil to bring out the freshness in their seafood! The cocktails, served at -12¡ãC, taste FRESH!  Made my first visit there from friend's recommendation and tried all of their 3 signature cocktails, Strawberry, Coconut and Kyoho grapes. The ingredients are freshly pacotized (according to their website), and it seriously brought me to heaven! Ordered a portion of baby squids for sharing (as it was rather late that night, that we headed there for some really chill night out) - SO FRESH! I have never imagined that COCONUT can make such an awesome ingredient for a cocktail. lovely surprise!  p.s. waiter was SO NICE, and asked us ""is everything ok?"" after serving. top notch!  I love that place, the environment (can get really quiet as they have limited tables), the drinks, the food! Gonna frequent this place whenever I have some cocktail cravings!"
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,3,5-Nov-15,"I really want to like this place more, but I couldn't.  Yes, I do appreciate the effort taken to source the freshest ingredients, the lengths gone to prepare a tasty broth, etc.  I also understand the high costs of operating, and the fact that quality seafood costs a lot in Singapore.  The food is indeed delicious. But it lacks a wow factor needed to make up for the high price."
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,5,22-Jun-16,"The Naked Finn is run by Ken Loon whom I met through a friend. Since I was in Singapore he invited me to his restaurant and I spent an evening chatting with him and enjoying his food.  As is always a good idea, I let the host choose the menu, so Ken got us an assortment including squid, fish, scallop, pork, risotto etc. All of which was very good, though if I am going to pick favorites, the squid was really special. Grilled to perfection and just the right consistency. This is something I am going to miss when going back to Norway.  Okay, I'm going to pick one more favorite: the pork. Incredibly tender and juicy shoulder of iberico pork (if I am not mistaken). I ate most of it without any form of sauce or condiments. It was just so good by itself.  I also got a tour of the fish tanks and the kitchen. The place has a very modern feel while at the same time feeling human-centric. Ken has his books and his desk out in the restaurant. Including his big stack of papers on bivalves :-).  The fish we had (I don't remember the name of the species. I don' think it is something I've had before), Ken had caught himself. He has a very hands-on approach with the raw materials which reminds me a bit about F?viken.  I like down-to-earth restaurant experiences that is about good food and good conversation. And this is as good as it gets.  I had an excellent evening!  (To my Norwegian friends: the name of the restaurant has nothing to do with naked people from Finland. I suggest you visit the restaurant and ask for yourself what the name means)"
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,5,1-Jun-18,I recently traveled to Singapore for the first time. From what I had heard leading up to my trip was that it was a very clean country with excellent food. Both rang true from my experience. I found the Naked Fin on yelp by looking up restaurants around me. I love to pair my food with a good glass of wine and the images provided on their yelp page won me over immediately. Most of the restaurants here don't offer a drink list and are small pop-up shops that are outdoors and the humidity has been a bit of a change from my SoCal weather. Haha so that's why The Naked Fin stood out to me. Further more there was a video. It was a quick little blurb about the owner and how The Naked Fin got started. It gave all the more reassurance this would be the experience I was hoping for. Once I arrived it was what I expected and more. The food cooking in the back smelt great they staff was so greeting and really helped me pick what would be best for me as I didn't understand most of the menu and terminology. The big reason I wanted to go as well was this Baby Indian Squid App that I saw in the video and on their yelp page. I have enclosed a photo. OMG! It was even better than I imagined. It tasted like crispy sesame seed oil. They cooked them just right and I was so happy I got them. The prawn soup was great as well. It pair great with the white wine (I would compare to a Pino Grigio) they went excellent together and I was very happy with the service food and over all experience here. If you're in Singapore The Naked Fin is a MUST TRY!
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,4,5-Feb-15,"What a hidden gem inside Gilman Barrack! After some gallery hopping a group of us came for dinner. We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality and taste of food. The restaurant only have less than 8 tables so I'd recommend making a ressy ahead of time.  We started with some razor clam ceviche and baby squid, both very fresh and delicately seasoned. For entr¨¦e we had their iberico pork and grilled fish, both cooked to near perfection. Will definitely be back for more!"
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,5,13-Jan-14,"LIKE.  The perfect ending to any Gillman Barracks visit (or rather hike) is a dinner at the Naked Finn. Service is great, dishes are great, the place is great. There isn't much I could complain about... Well, maybe the music was a tad 1980s ballad-ish, but I can forgive that considering how rarely I find a gem amidst Singapore's great, big culinary landscape.  We ordered the chilled bee hoon which was fantastic. It's large so order it to share. The squid, the prawns, the fish - all the seafoods were grilled, seared and fried to perfection. The wine list wasn't over-whelming but instead offered good, simple, unpretentious choices. Add to the evening some pretty fantastic cocktails (our favourite du soir was the coconut one) and it's about as good a meal as one can find.  Oh and the cherry on top: the prices were very reasonable.  Have you sensed that I really like this place yet?"
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,5,1-Mar-15,"5 stars cos it's so hard to fault this little gem. From the service experience while booking the place to the actual dinning experience, it's one of the best I've experienced in this part of the world.  The space itself is great. Small and cosy but doesn't feel cramped at all. Unpretentious with IKEA kitchenware and yet tasteful at the same time. Music's at the perfect volume and playlist is legit.  Food is just delightful. Fresh and thoughtfully put together. Me and the missus had the set dinner for 2 and every dish that came with it was really tasty. The cocktails are amazing as well. Simple yet punchy.  Most of all, the people there are lovely. They all looked like they really love what they do, and was informative and engaged throughout the night.  Go, if you want a charming, non-pretentious and overall great dining experience."
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,4,27-Feb-13,"The 2 person seafood set at $120 sounds pricey but given the high standard of preparation its not unreasonable: Eat as much as you like beehoon, cooked to perfection Grilled razor clams, giant sized:) Littleneck clams - some of the sweetest I've had Grilled shrimp - sweeter than most prawns one gets Pan-friedn barramundi Grilled lobster but really it what Aussies like to call a yabbie Blanched kang kong - great way of serving something so familiar  A good choice of wine if a short wine list, but should be something for everyone. Red wine was chilled :( minus one star."
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,4,9-Feb-13,"I rate the Naked Finn and I will be coming back. I'll state that upfront.  I went yesterday night again..drinks with friends from work with bites...Dinner for them, half dinner for me. My rating is 4 stars overall because there are a few misses. Overall still a solid choice and the service was helpful and pleasant.  Here's the rundown:  Cocktails 1) coconut - Yes! I finally got to try it. This was our top pick o the night. They blended the flesh in as well which gave the slushy sorbet a creamier texture. Very coconuty..but you know how some coconuts taste old. This tasted like the sweetest freshest thai coconut had been used. Friends all loved it after tasting mine. 2) white peach bellini - friend had this. It was refreshing. 3) melon with the hendrick's gin - this was more subtle. melon taste was there but it was definitely less sweet and had a bit of bitterness. I wasn't sure if it was from the rind of the melon but my friend thought it was the gin. 4) orange guava cocktail - I had this before so I didn't try. My friend said nice but a bit too sweet. She said her first drink the bellini was better. 5) mojito - we all thought this had hardly enough sugar or none in it. My friend asked for sugar syrup to add up. Because of the addition of the orion beer, this was quite a light tasting cocktail. I wouldn't order it again. 6) kalamansi - I wanted something sour and this was indeed sour. In fact my friends all made faces when they tried and said it was too much. While I did enjoy it..towards the end I found it too much and I actually left some in the glass. Only if you REALLY like sour. On hindsight I wish I had ordered 2 coconuts haha  Food: 1) baby squids - YUMS! Simply grilled, juicy..lots of flavour. 2) clams in white wine - needed more white wine. My friends said it was very ""healthy"" and I should have more as I was under the weather. 3) cold bee hoon - lightly seasoned, not greasy with a tang of lemon. really nice complement to the food..or just eat it on its own..or drizzle it with the above said clam broth to elevate the clam broth (haha rather than the other way round) 4) northern prawns - predominant impression was salty. Gavin did explain they overcook these a bit so the shells can be eaten. I saw another lady eating the big prawns and those looked really juicy which was more the kind of prawns I was expecting. 5) razor clams - $12 a piece but surprisingly meaty. fresh and yummy. although they drizzled with shallot oil, it didn't taste oily.  Staff were rather busy but responsive. It's a tiny place so it's hard to do a big group unless you book early."
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,5,17-Jan-13,"Went here very spontaneously last night for a drink after a long day at work. Had dinner at home..felt something was missing. Naked Finn came to mind. Called them at 11pm and they said the last order for food was past at 10:30pm. I said I'm really just needing a drink and they said last order for that is 11:30 and to come on down.  Was a little surprised to see it. Tiny glass house. Loved the look as it was clean and white. I'm a modernist at heart. Felt much roomier than I expected inside but I think that's because it was quiet. They had a long table setup inside with a group and another table in the corner and about 6 chairs along the bar. Bar seats were large and spaced out and it helped I could waltz (stumble?) right in and drag myself straight onto a high chair. Menus were presented. I asked the bartender Gavin what he thought...  He explained that basically cocktails there are sorbet based (signature cocktails) and classics which were a lot of South American (Mojitos, capirinhas but with their spin on it).  We went back and forth..hey I was only having one drink and I had to make it count. Needed a pick me up. Finally settled on the coconut (note the signature drinks don't have names but have the list of ingredients but they're often called after the first ingredient). I love fresh coconut and he said it was one of their most popular drinks. I was intrigued by the kalamansi and sour prune one as my original thought was refreshing and sour (same brief I gave to Zach at Suprette a few nights ago).  Turns out coconut was sold out. Doh! Brother meanwhile was a little impatient waiting for me as he had settled on his ""orange guava"" very quickly (with kronenbourg blanc 1664) while Gavin was very patiently going through the menu with me. Don't get me wrong..he was recommending but I was vacillating (did I spell that right? That was one strong drink! More on that later..)  In the end he recommended I go for the pear, the last on the signature list. I did mention the kalamansi sour prune a few times but he didn't dwell on it. I should make it a mission to go back and have that.  I had gotten there just before 1130 and with all the discussion on drinks, he said bar snacks were still available and he did check with us later as well before the kitchen started washing up.  Ok..verdict. My brother liked his drink very much. I had a taste. We talked about how it was yummy, could definitely taste the orange and guava and it was nicely balanced. My drink was served in a big martini glass all frosted up and it was refreshing and had all the different flavours showing. Gavin showed me the liqueur eau de vie Poire Williams bottle (Menu misspelled it as view I realise now typing this) and asked me to take a sniff, it was peary! He said it was very strong and they only put 5ml in. It said 43% on the bottle. I did a wiki and it's a fruity clear brandy made from Williams or Bartlet pears. Again, I enjoyed that the drink was nicely balanced and tasty and you could also taste the cucumber which was the last ingredient (cucumber infused vodka).  Had a nice chat with Gavin, he was from Barstories previously. I said I would be back and would try to bring my friend who had brought me to Barstories before. He explained the name from the book Great Expectations and said they would do a movie screening of the same later in January.  Drinks were mostly $18 or $20, no service charge but add GST . Must have been stronger than I thought coz I had the one drink in a big martini glass and I had to concentrate very slightly to walk straight haha!  I looked at food menu. All seafood. They had a platter for 1 at $88 or a platter for 2 at $128 which they recommended as they said going ala carte is less food for more money.  We were the last in..first out. I just needed something easy on a whim and we got that so 5 stars for the experience, friendliness and drinks. We had parked on the grass edge outside which assisted in the waltzing in and out.  Easy parking. check Easy stress-free experience. check Yummy cold drink for $20. check Friendly patient bartender. check Picked me up. check"
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,4,29-Dec-14,"We went to this restaurant because of its reputation for simple good food. We decided to go for lunch. The restaurant is a shack located in isolation next to a running track. Would have had a hard time locating it if not for my trusty GPS. The restaurant is small, so reservations are a must. You need to call them in the afternoon otherwise no one answers the phone. The lunch menu is simple and uncomplicated. We had the lobster roll with creme freche and a fish and chips. The roll was excellent with generous portions of lobster cooked well. Likewise the fish and chips though I think it was a tad overdone. The fish they use is the ling fish. Line caught and very good. Price wise is a little high, but with 3 portions of lobster what do you expect. The meal for 6 persons including 4 chendol deserts was $255"
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,4,31-Mar-13,"Look, the big tip for this place is to listen to what they are pimping that evening and order that. There are no two ways when it comes to seafood. You can't do anything if the produce is below par, and with their minimal cooking methods they can't risk it either. We (over)ordered an extra fish that the restaurant was not recommending and it took the edge off an otherwise good meal.  Other than that, YES, do visit, keep the ordering sane, have a cocktail or a nice craft beer and enjoy the evening and the peaceful surroundings.  I'm coming back."
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,3,20-Aug-14,"expensive seafood at this uppity too-cool-for-school restaurant at the gilman barracks. this place - well. the food is good (let's get it out of the way), but it's simply cooked, it's simply expensive, and service is pretty inadequate for the price you're paying.  I simply don't understand the hype - seafood is abundant in singapore, and a more-than-decent dish is more than easily found (even at your neighborhood czechar store) - it's the sort of seafood restaurant I'd imagine in a land-locked part of the US, where seafood is both posh and inaccessible.  but I'll give it to them that the seafood is fresh and delicious in its simplicity, but I'd hazard a guess, too, that anyone with half-decent cooking skills can churn out similar dishes.  the most economical option here would be to take their set menu (which is still pretty price-hefty) for a taster of their dishes. it starts with a simply dressed salad, and fried vermicelli noodles (simpler-ly known as fried beehoon in this part of the world) are brought to the table as accompaniment to the subsequent dishes.  and it's good right, but a lot of it is due in part to the fresh produce they've got (which is admirable) as opposed to any particular skill (which is the point of visiting restaurants). not that not-overcooking seafood is not a skill (omg, triple negatives!) - but it's a pretty basic one.  fat, plump clams in an easily-drinkable, more-ish soup that went well with the beehoon, and plainly seared scallops served in-shell with garlic. plump and sweet, those were delicious.  these were followed by grilled mozambique - read: skinny - lobsters that had a good charred flavor, the same of which you could smell and taste in the seared fish and baby squid. that baby squid was pretty delicious - they were chewy but tender, with none of that crisp nothingness that happens with deep-frying.  so the food was good - even if I might complain about price - but service is pretty hit-miss. the good thing was that we had chirpy waiters dishing up our food - but we had to be chased out after barely two hours of a long many-coursed dinner (such is the quirk of trendy, busy restaurants), and they refused to bring me a glass of water when I first walked in (IT'S SELF-SERVICE, PLEASE) even though there was no one else in the restaurant and the waiters were milling about."
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,4,23-Sep-15,"Nice ""for a change"" sort of place to have lunch. You know the food's good when the lunch crowd is decent despite the out of the way location. We got the prawn mee, which was nice. Not quite as ""strong"" as the soup from the more traditional prawn mee places (e.g. the one at Pepys Road), but things came together well. Would have been nicer if the stock came out piping hot.  Desserts are ok."
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,4,19-Feb-13,"It is a hide away from the hectic city. A delightful cocktail bar with simple honest dishes. I enjoy the flavorful concoctions along with their seasonal changes. The boys do a great job at introducing you with the menu. They are also brilliantly smart at pairings and precise with measurements, so if you have the time and right company, sit by the bar for a nice show.  Their bee hoon is a must. I only say this because I have a weakness for spicy food and they spoil me with four different types of chilies. Life can't get better.  Yes it is out of the way, but that is the pleasure of being there. Keep up the great work guys."
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,5,20-Feb-16,"Since dining almost 2 years ago, The Naked Finn has moved to new premises, barely 100 meters away from their old haunt, which is, incidentally, now its sister bar. Its greenhouse aesthetic is maintained, so you get an expansive view of the lush surrounds of Gillman Barracks. It's a terrific escape from the hustle and bustle of city living. Be sure to make reservations though, it was a busy full house on a Friday afternoon when we popped by for lunch.  Very little is done to the seafood, which is fresh and sweet. If you thought that read bland food, you'd be mightily mistaken. The food here is hearty and soulful, and robust with flavour. It's just that when the ingredient's that fresh and sweet, very little needs to be done to it.  We had:  1) Grilled Indian Baby Squid ($8) - seasoned simply with a flick of sea salt and slick of olive oil: must try. Soft, sweet and succulent  2) Beef Burger ($23): At first blush, it looked disappointingly minuscule. But (some, not all) good things come in small packages, and this turned out an indulgent, finger-licking-good powerhouse. The decadent grass-fed dry-aged Japanese wagyu patty, dripping with juices, came together with the Boston lettuce, American cheese, and special sauce brilliantly. Just be sure to get double (or triple) orders of this if you're hungry.  3) Pan-fried Barramundi Fillet ($20): paper-crisp skin and moist flaky meat. This was seasoned with olive oil and finished with sea salt, accompanied by a mound of blanched kangkong tossed in kalamansi juice, dried shrimp, and shallot oil, and vermicelli oiled in sesame and fried garlic bits, both served refreshingly chilled  4) Hae Mee Tng ($25): a medley of farmed giant tiger prawns, Salmon Creek Farms pork belly, in a blended soup of 9 prawn species and simmered pork bones. This was rich and sweet but not cloying, as The Naked Finn resists the addition of MSG or sugar. Get the vermicelli for a traditional option, or the Japanese somen for a twist on the classic.  5) Homemade Naked Chendol ($13) with coconut sorbet: deconstructed version of a local classic, but refreshingly lovely  6) Homemade Gula Melaka Sorbet with Sea Salt ($10): a twist on the flavour du jour, salted caramel. An absolute must-try.  7) Homemade Sour Plum Sorbet ($10) with osmanthus jelly: recommended if you prefer a tangy refreshing end to your meal"
The Naked Finn,4.3,19,Seafood,5,5-Jul-14,"Wasn't sure what to expect, but this place is great -- really fresh, simply prepared, high quality seafood. Reminded me of trendy places in Boston or San Francisco. Ambience was cool -- quiet, cool music, intimate, slightly hipster. Service was so, so good. We had:  - Scallop ceviche style - this was awesome, my favorite of the night. Lemony and garlicky but also light. - Scallop seared - good but the garlic was a bit overpowering on this one - Pumpkin cream soup - really nice and filling, paired well with the garlic flavors of my mains. - Baby squids - overly generous portion, sort of fried but without much seasoning - Barramundi - really flavorful and fresh, with good portion size; could have had this as the main dish only - Noodles - good complement but not necessary  Oh my gosh, and the cocktails are amazing. Worth a trip there for the cocktails alone."
Granny's Pancake,4,1,"Breakfast & Brunch, Coffee & Tea",4,3-Mar-16,"Traditional snacks, fast food type of food, grab and eat walk kind of food  Locals need no introduction. Tourist will find this a like a waffle-like thick pancake with fillings without the holes.  Here it is made right there as the vendor sells them. She makes sure the pan is clean, and layers in the pre-mix pancake liquid mix, and while it cooks, she loads the ingredients onto the ready pancakes, cuts the pancakes in her own way of equitable sizes, shelves it in the display, and begins to hand the pancakes to the customers as they order into boxes or small plastic bags.  The process probably needs re-thinking if she want to franchise (it says so right there on the signboard)  Taste - it taste great, just like the many hundreds of pancakes I have had eaten before since young. The redbean filling taste just like every other redbean fillings, the peanut is fresh and crunchy, and the coconut is pretty good.  For $0.80, or $0.90 for the coconut, is very reasonable."
Bak Chor Mee Lorong 5 Toa Payoh,5,1,Food Court,5,7-Apr-19,"The bak chor mee here is just special. It's one the best. Noodle are super tasty and springy, cooked perfectly to provide best texture and taste.  For $4, the abalone mushroom is a nice touch. The soup is also v tasty.  Just became my favorite BCM.  Be careful though, the queues can be daunting."
Founder Bak Kut Teh,4.3,15,Singaporean,5,11-Aug-17,"This bak kut teh broth is nice and peppery, unlike several others I've tried. I enjoy the kick of spice it gives and the ribs are juicy and meaty. There are a few grades of ribs you can choose from but the soup is unlimited refills.  The table comfortably sat my party of five and our server was friendly and efficient. We ordered a few barley teas and lime juices to cool down with in the summer heat. The side dishes (well, because I treat bak kut teh as my main), including braised pig's trotter, bean curd, and vegetables were nice complements to the rice and soup.  I loved the thick soy sauce and spicy sauce to dip the ribs into for an extra burst of flavor. I would recommend getting the premium short ribs or the premium ribs (longer) over the other ones although pricier because they are meatier and totally worth it.  The restrooms are located outside of the restaurant (seems to be shared with other establishments?) but fortunately immaculate."
Founder Bak Kut Teh,4.3,15,Singaporean,5,30-Aug-23,"Another Singapore national dish ... bak kut teh aka pork rib soup . Great for breakfast , lunch , dinner, supper, long day of drinking , or hung over ! Tip Singaporeans prefer founders vs song fa. How do I know this ? Cause I'm with 3rd generation Singaporeans all day , everyday ! Another tip , you can ask for refills of broth ."
Founder Bak Kut Teh,4.3,15,Singaporean,4,28-Nov-19,"Bak Kut Teh is one of those famous Singaporean/Malaysian dishes you have to try when you're in Singapore. It was definitely on my list of things to eat on my vacation to Asia. I was walking by to check out the other restaurants in the food court nearby and added Founder Bak Kut Teh to my bookmark list to try.  I've never had it before, and my first thoughts were that the broth is super peppery. Very strong, but delicious. The meat was tender and comes clean off the bone. I finished the soup, and the waiter came by and filled up the broth a couple of times. I think it's bottomless soup.  We also ordered a bunch of other dishes: pig's trotter, crispy prawn roll, and trio steam egg. I really like fatty cuts of pork, like pork belly, so the pig's trotter was delicious! Everything was pretty good, but the price was slightly higher than a lot of the meals I had in the food courts nearby. Yet, it still wasn't too expensive by San Francisco standards. My only complaint was that while all the food came out within a few minutes, there was quite a wait for the trio steam egg. There was a 30-minute additional wait after all our other dishes hit the table. Don't get me wrong, the egg dish was really good. Like a smooth delicate savory custard with just the right amount of sodium."
Founder Bak Kut Teh,4.3,15,Singaporean,4,12-Jan-18,"The service sucks, but the food is great.  This is one of many locations in Singapore where you can get bak kut teh, which is essentially a sort of soup broth with various ingredients. Of note is the ""Founder Bak Kut Teh"" itself, the namesake of the restaurant, which basically comprises pork ribs in broth. Needless to say, the bak kut teh is superbly peppery and savory, which I really appreciated, and I'd highly recommend trying.  My only complaint: the service here is kinda abysmal. The servers forgot some of my orders, more or less ignored me, and worked at a glacial pace. A hair frustrating, but not really a huge deal."
Founder Bak Kut Teh,4.3,15,Singaporean,5,26-Jan-16,"Founder bak kut Teh - whose original store still remains at Balestier - has opened its second outlet, and this new branch is much welcome indeed!!  With scores of pictures of celebs posing next to the beaming founder, Mr. Chua, one is reminded of how popular and well-known this humble eatery is.  Founder's is a teochew-style BKT; meaning to say, the broth is peppery. However, to my memory, the broth used to be *more* peppery which I'd have preferred. But, in any case, it's still good. I had many bowls of the soup, & I'll mention more of that later.  We were told that fresh pork ribs are in short supply in the industry. Founder's had to ensure the supplier provides them with only the best & freshest cuts. And one bite shows you exactly what you're paying for.  The Premium BKT ($10) uses the long bone ribs. And boy, they were tender, juicy and fall-off-bone. I kid you not. So so so good. Even the regular ribs ($8, I.e. Short bone) were good too. My dining companions preferred these as they were less fatty, but I much preferred the premium ribs. Haha!  The surprise of the evening was the fantastic braised pig trotter dish ($8/$10/$12). I thought it was going to be fatty but it wasn't! Again, very soft, tender and flavorful. And the gravy? Sublime. Like, yowza. Slurpsome. I was shamelessly slurping the gravy when no one was looking. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be so good. Well, there you go.  The bean sprouts ($5/$6/$8) were good, although unspectacular. What you need to try, however, is the delectable bean curd skin ($3/$4/$5). This is a must-order, IMHO. Silken, soft, satisfying. Yum, yum. Tau Kee never tasted so good.  And if you are so inclined, they have pig's intestines & stomach too. I didn't try the former (no, thanks!) but the latter was yummers. Haha! Don't ask me why one is less palatable to me than the other.  Iced jelly rounded up our dessert and I also had the refreshing baby coconut too. The flesh was soft and sweet. Quite exquisite. What a way to end our meal!  Coupled with good service, and bottomless BKT broth (yes, do not be shy in asking for it to be topped up!!), what more can one ask for?  I'm glad I work in the vicinity!!!!  Happy happy. :)"
Founder Bak Kut Teh,4.3,15,Singaporean,5,30-Aug-16,"One of the best when it comes to the famed bak kut teh dish here in Singapore. You can't help but notice the many famed celebrities who have tried his dish. They are A list Asian celebrities like Chow Yun Fat, LeeHom and Jay Chou.  The food is definitely excellent. They have his famed signature dish which has a combo of fatty and lean meats. So others who have a preference can go with the leaner or fatter meats if they so prefer.  As note, the soup base has a very peppery taste to it which gives it a great kick to the flavor. All the side dishes were well prepared too.  It does live up to its name and if you give it a try you will understand why so many celebrities have also loved it."
Founder Bak Kut Teh,4.3,15,Singaporean,4,5-Aug-18,"Singapore Bak Kut Teh, not too bad lah! Why? There are times where I crave bak Kut Teh and it doesn't matter which section of Singapore you step in there is always some for you to eat. During my last trip to Singapore this caught my attention. However, I picked this joint because I like the hometown authenticity that it provides. The service here are really on point, once I entered a staff member quickly seated me. If you don't just want the soup and meet, no worries, at this place you can get a great variety of drinks that suit your taste. Not bad for some ribs with ample sauces for you to choose. This is a little bit of a drive from my flat but really worth the commute if you want some nice food. Drawback: Despite food being great, the bathrooms are not in the establishment. It's advised that you go before eating here. If you are price careful, it's best that you don't stop by because it costs a lot."
Founder Bak Kut Teh,4.3,15,Singaporean,5,27-Jul-18,Our family favourite dine out place.. serves the peppery authentic bkt that beats a lot of other places. Recommended for families. They have also introduced kids meals suitable for the little ones. Thanks for the innovation.
Founder Bak Kut Teh,4.3,15,Singaporean,4,1-Oct-17,"For those who prefer their broth very peppery and not too herbal-tasting, this is it! Long menu; in addition to different ribs, they have offals and tau fu cooked different ways, pig trotters, ngoh hiang , fish and seafood, although abalones may not sell well at $53++. One of the better bak kut teh/gou ru cha placed in town, served in comfortable aircon environment."
Founder Bak Kut Teh,4.3,15,Singaporean,5,4-Jan-17,"Had always went to Founder Bak Kut Teh on Balestier Road but due to time constrain, came to this more convenience location. First time here too. The location is more accessible and it is Air-Con which is very useful in Singapore's hot and humid climate. In general, the Bak Kut Teh is expected and so are the side dishes. My favorite are Premium Short Ribs, Braised Egg, Salted Vegetable and Peanuts and don't forget to ask for extra soup and garlic. Love that peppery soup base which is the soul of Bak Kut Teh. On the side, the only lag is the ambience in IMHO, somehow I feel it's more 'fun' on the Balestier Road location. I should have given 4 and half stars ;-)"
Founder Bak Kut Teh,4.3,15,Singaporean,3,31-Jul-17,"We came to this soup/ribs shop on recommendation of a friend. Apparently, many celebs visit it as well and this shop shows that by displaying their pictures all over the walls. Their signature hot soup was flavorful and soothing to the stomach. However, I feel that this place does not live up to its hype and lacks value. What I mean by that: my friend and I each spent about 15 U.S. dollars, but all we had was a small bowl of soup with a few small pieces of dry ribs and two drinks. While it is nice that we can refill the soup, the portion is still pretty small for the price. Given that we're in the country with the cheapest Michelin restaurant (only $3 for a meal, or so I heard), I'm sure that we could also get the same bowl of soup for a much better deal else where. Not to mention, I asked for my drink with no ice but instead they filled the cup with 3/5 ice"
Founder Bak Kut Teh,4.3,15,Singaporean,4,26-Mar-18,Seemingly famous bat kut teh with pictures of the owner and many celebrities decorating the walls. The broth is more peppery and has more kick then the others I've had. Overall the food is good quality and service is on point. It is however a bit on the pricy side.
Founder Bak Kut Teh,4.3,15,Singaporean,4,20-Nov-18,"Yum. I wasn't really sure what bak kut the was when my cousins suggested it. But, when in Rome, right? Anyway, this place is a more full service sit down establishment than most of the food stands in the area. It's still casual, but you get table service. I ordered the namesake founder bak kut yeh, which is pork chips braised in this seasoned broth, which, I should add, one of the servers was very keen on refilling in a timely manner. I also got soy sauce eggs, Chinese donuts, fried chicken wings, and a couple tofu dishes. The bak kut teh was delicious. The meat was super tender and flavorful, as was the broth. It was delicious eaten with plain white rice. Loved the Chinese donut as well... it was cut into little piece ax which were nice and crispy. Btw, if you know what Chinese donuts are, you know one of life's travesties is when they Re served soggy. Chicken wings were crisp and juicy. The soy eggs were decent. They were a little more seasoned than my mom used to make them, but still a good addition to the meal. Didn't really care for the tofu though. I tried one that was deep fried with some sweet chili sauce. I found the sauce too sweet. Also. I should add the food came out almost immediately after we ordered, which was terrific, since I was starving. Definitely worth a try."
Founder Bak Kut Teh,4.3,15,Singaporean,4,19-Mar-17,This outlet is more convenient and less crowded. Always enjoy Founder Bah Kut Teh due to it's extra strong peppery soup. Plus point is also it's wide variety of side dishes to go with you bah kut teh. I also found the meat here better tasting and more tender. Highly recommended!

The Cliff at Sentosa,,,,3,13-Apr-18,"Subpar service and above average food. Every place in the hotel is nice, but they need more people working. Took time for our order to be taken. Food started coming before we got our drinks...  The mushroom soup is very mushroom-y. I expected something more creamier. Calamari was good. It came with some fried taro or yam of some sort too. The crosontini with sea bream tartare was delicious. I strongly recommend! Squid ink tonnarelli was alright."
The Cliff at Sentosa,,,,4,18-Sep-14,"This place is out to impress your date with a romantic fine dining experience (But be prepared to spend a bomb)! Reserve early as only a few good seats get a nice sunset view to enjoy with your date! Best timing to go is 6:30-6:45pm where you can slowly enjoy the sun settling down with a nice cup of tea in its wide sofa that you can even lay your whole body on!  It is just located off a cliff of forest and sea view, the best part is it has no mosquitoes!!! The service is good, i was served by a bubbly waitress, they served the food at an interval just nice for you to chat with your date and even explain to you the tiny details of the dishes served.  I got the 2 sets of 4 course meal which consists of the choice of Pumpkin soup or Seafood soup (i reckoned the pumpkin ones - there's an egg inside that brings out the taste of the soup), next is the Asparagus texture (something interesting as i feel no asparagus texture just a cake to dip into an asparagus shaped sauce with pretty petals as garnish), followed by a Duo of Scallops (very soft that it glides in your mouth). As for the Main course you can have tenderloins or steam red grouper (both are good!). The dessert is splendidly full of surprises and taste as it looks, it has top layered caramelized banana slices, drops of blueberries to raspberry and the warm chocolate truffle comes oozing out when you cut them, it goes well with its vanilla ice-cream!  With its drinks and order 2 oysters i spent about $411+ (inc GST and Service Charge), but its worth the experience!  Overall, food wise i would only give 7/10. Service: 9/10 Ambience: 10/10"
The Cliff at Sentosa,,,,4,21-Jun-14,"My fianc¨¦ took me to The Cliff last night for a beautiful birthday dinner. The service and delicious food was lovely and a nice romantic way to celebrate. It is priced very high even for Singapore but for a special occasion, it was very much worth it."
The Cliff at Sentosa,,,,5,20-Jan-13,"The price is on the high end, but for it you get excellent selection, great location, impeccable service. We go here to celebrate important events, the place has never let us down.  Try the 6 item sampling menu, you may trust them on the wine as well."

There's lots of delicious delicacies here and you must explore many times to be able to try each and every food store!  I can't review or recommend all as there are simply too many stores  1) Kallang western food 2) Lor Mee  These two are my favourite though!  Happy exploring !"
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,28-Sep-23,"On our first night in Singapore, came here for dinner as it's close to where we stayed. Apparently, we order, pay right there and wait for the food rather than give them your table number and have them bring the food to you then you pay. Everything is about 4-6 sgd. we ordered the oyster omelette, pork ribs with water cress soup, lor mee, and char kueh tiao. It was all good and we were stuffed! Come check out this hawker stall!"
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,15-May-24,Have to give the Nam Sing hokkien mee uncle some love. Been eating from him for over 10 years and always awesome
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,22-Dec-23,"Absolutely my favorite hawker center in Singapore. I request to go here every time I'm in Singapore and it never disappoints. Clean environment and easy to move around without being on top of one another. Open and breezy the smells will draw you in and make you hungry. Just about any type of local food you want is available, fresh and plentiful."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,16-Jun-19,"Five-star Food Centre! The hardest decision starving myself so I can pack all the delicious offerings and still lament over what else I want to eat.  Disclaimer: No air-conditioning, noisy, crowded, and expect long lines or queues. If you can put aside these dining conditions, Old Airport Road is AMAZING! It is a Must-Eat Stop for me in SG.  Top of my list: Seafood Soup with Minced Pork Balls Yan Ji Seafood Soup): This cloudy soup is slowed cooked with layers of flavor. There is hint of wokhei. Fried flat fish ground and added to the minced pork elevates the flavor. It is salty and I don't like cooked seafood usually, but I cannot got enough of this broth. I dream about this soup in the USA. I usually get the soup with just the meatballs, but everyone else gets fish. I hear the prawns are cooked perfectly, firm, succulent and sweet. Hint: the cheap standard fish they offer is good enough. Don't be put off the price. It is worth it. Drink lots of water after that. $6 up per bowl.  Rojak or Salad with Shrimp Paste: Jicama, guava, cucumber, pineapple, bean sprouts, crispy ew char kuay or fried dough sticks, Century eggs (fermented black eggs buried underground with ammonia) mixed with a sweet, nutty haekor or shrimp paste that has the consistency of molasses.  Gong Gong or boiled sea snails: It is an art to eat these delectable bad boys. Gingerly skewer the flesh beyond the foot. Slowly ease the flesh until the whole animal is out. Hold the morsel by the foot, dip into sambal belacan or chili paste with fermented shrimp with a generous squeeze of lime, hold foot, bite and remove foot. It is chewy near the foot, creamy entrails at the end, spicy and delicate gift from the sea. $10 per plate.  Char siu pork and roast pork (sioh bak) from Roast Paradise: crispy deeply marinated char siu and salty, crunchy roast pork belly and crackling served with rice. Tasty dipping sauce and mustard for condiments. Ask for more cucumber.  Ice Kachang or shaved ice: Smooth shaved ice drizzled with colored stripes and sweet corn with syrup atop red beans, jellies and uptup chee, gelatinous sweetened seeds from a palm. They are generous, I found 4 yesterday!!! It is better when you share and fight for the uptup chee. Other delicious desserts are the green jellied Nonya Chendol shaved iced drizzled with gula Melaka palm sugar syrup , Cheng Tng dessert soup with lotus seeds, gingko nuts and dried longan.  There are so many other stalls I wanted to try, but I can't get past my favorites. I want to try at least one more dish each time but my stomach fails me.  If you are still peckish, try the Epok Epok or curry puff with egg, char kuay teow or rice noodles with black soy and cockles, plump oysters in a half shell (S$3 per oyster)."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,18-Jun-18,"If you come to this food court, get the prawn mee at Albert Street Prawn Noodle. The line can get outrageously long, so maybe try getting here before the rush. Seriously though, the prawn mee is amazingly delicious- a really unique and complex mix of flavors in one broth. Also, get the Or Chein (oyster omelette) at Xing Li Cooked Food. And if you have a sweet tooth and want something to cool down with away from the heat and humidity, Nyona Chendol is good- I like the original, but adding red beans looks just as good. Everything here is cheap, relatively speaking.  Old Airport Road is popular and a bit more touristy, but also a little further away from town, so if you're a visitor, you should just call a taxi (MRT is always good, but not everyone has the time or patience to check routes and stops). If you're a tourist with little to no exposure to Singaporean and Malaysian food, most of the food here will probably seem to be delicious to you. More often than not, if there's a long line for one particular hawker, the food is good. But seriously, no trip Singapore would be complete without visiting a good ole food court."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,16-Apr-18,"Praise the lord for Hawker centers! With so many hawker centers in Singapore, it is hard to decide which one in my favourite. Old Airport Road Food Centre is definitely a stand out. It is highly accessible via multiple bus line.  With endless options such as prawn noodle, wonton noodles, fish balls, fresh juice, curry puffs, rojak, kopi and kaya toast available; this center is where food dreams are form.  Be sure to visit Old Airport Road Food Centre to eat till your heart is content!"
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,21-Sep-18,"Selera Rasa - If you have not heard of the now $3.50 briyani, you are missing out. Used to get this back in my ns days when it was like $3 and was super stoked to find out the hawker was still around 4 years later. The macik is the best, she is super nice and used to remember our faces when we came over for lunch. That being said, I only remember her being opened till the mid afternoon. Never saw the place open for dinner.  But I digress. This is hands-down one of the best briyanis on the island. The rice is fragrant and goes super well with the curry they used. The fried chicken and it's little fried scraps are tasty and fresh. Be sure to ask for veg and the papadum as well, she was out of veg when I got there at 2pm.  Nevertheless, always worth the visit. Selera Rasa is located in the corner of old airport road food center. The corner being the side closer to the hdb blocks, as opposed to the cross street."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,24-May-19,"I was excited to visit Old Airport Road Hawker Center specifically for ""Lor Mee"" from the Uber popular stall- - ""Xin Mei Xiang Zheng Zong"" after watching a segment on YouTube.  I braved the long queue and waited over an hour to partake in, what I expected to be a bowl of yumminess. Unfortunately, it was a huge disappointment!  Lor Mee- served with noodles and a generous topping of fish and other ingredients. The gravy was significantly rich and thick with a slightly gelatinous texture and predominantly tasted of fish. It's definitely an acquired taste. Not something I'd get again.  Despite the rave reviews of Lor Mee, the unsung hero is the Minced Mixed Noodle IMO. Pork dumplings and minced pork swimming in a bowl of wide rice noodles. The broth was light and full of flavors with the fresh herbs adding brightness to this delicious dish. A must try!  Char Kway Teow noodles and proteins were impeccably cooked with a beautifully smoky charred flavor however, it was well under seasoned and one noted. Perhaps a dash of soy sauce will help lift the flavors a bit or it was an off day for the stall. Overall it wasn't a bad dish.  Fried prawn and pork rolls were a mixed of sweet and savory flavors. While it wasn't my favorite, it was a nice side dish.  Curry Chicken and Black Pepper Pork Puffs had a flaky crispy crusts and loaded with herbs and spices. A great snack especially on the go.  A great tourist destination for food, sweets and beverages on the cheap!"
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,24-Feb-18,"My dad and I came here for lunch during our last day in Singapore. We went to eat at Maxwell Hawker Food Centre twice already and decided to come here instead. To get here, you'll need to take the MRT to ""Dakota"" stop and it's along the Circle (YELLOW) Line. This place is pretty huge. The first floor are the hawker stalls and the 2nd floor are mainly shops selling goods.  Stalls that we tried: -Roast Paradise [Stall #01-121]: They offer roasted pig and char siew dishes. Our meals costed 4 SGD each. -Hong Hua Dessert [Stall #01-86]: They offer a variety of shaved iced desserts. We shared the ""Ice Kachang"" and it costed 1.50 SGD. -We also got the sugar cane drink. But, I don't recall what stall it was.  Not bad overall. I wanted to try Chau Kee Satay [Stall #01-85], but they only open in the evenings. I also wanted to try Lao Ban Soya Beancurd [Stall #01-127] again, but I was already too full to eat anymore (Note: I tried their tofu dessert at Maxwell tho]. I'll come visit again whenever I'm in Singapore."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,27-Jan-17,"I loved the hawker center here. My cousin and her fiancee took us here as this was their favorite. You can find a seat first, and then go to all of the different stands. Let them know how many ppl are eating, they price the portions so you don't have to pay for more than you can eat.  They bring the food straight to your table number when it's ready. Even when you pay for beer, they bring the bottles to your table too. Absolutely great food and experience."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,2-Jul-22,"I always will tabao bk mini Soon Kueh, Rice Kueh & Gu Cai Kueh which is nicely pack in a box. (Have vegetarian choice) They sell Curry Puffs too which is the traditional type. Best thing is they are Halal, suitable for all races to enjoy. Will go tmr again with family."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",3,14-Jul-19,Ok. Maybe I was waiting to be blown away after it was talked up so much but it was just ok / good. We had some noodles and a clay chicken pot with rice. Clay pot dish seemed a little dry and over cooked to me. Maybe we went too late but and it was the bottom of the barrel. It did take 15 min to prepare so it wasn't just thrown together. Anyway pretty good and no complaints but I don't think I'd make the trek to a hawker market again. I'd eat passing by.  Experience box checked.

Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,26-Mar-18,"This is one of the many hawker centers in Singapore and compared to some of the other big ones, this one is much less touristy. Our friend who lives in Singapore suggested that we meet here for lunch and it was a fantastic adventure.  We employed the long queue method for determining which stalls to purchase from. For a feast of 4 dishes and 5 drinks, we spent about $30 total. The best item we got by far was the BBQ meat. I'm not sure which stall it was but this one is absolutely worth seeking out.  Happy eating!"
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,20-Aug-15,"Orchid Coffee Stall #11 (facing main road) Sugar Cane Juice The owner of the stall isn't very pushy but he will approach nearby tables if they want a drink. The sugar cane juice here is pretty decent and refreshing. $1.50 a cup.  Western Barbeque #53 Supposedly a famous stall, and they serve each plate with bun all wrapped up in plastic, very old school. We ordered, chicken, pork and lamb. All were tender and juicy. The sunny side up was perfect too.  Jogurtz #129 A newly opened froyo stall on the back row, serves small $3.50 or large $5 cups, to be honest, both small and large cups seems to have the same amount of froyo, just more toppings in the large cup. The small sized cup seems to be at least a medium sized Llao Llao cup. It's more icy and slightly more sour than other competitors but it is very refreshing to eat this after alot of bbq and greasy food.  Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow ÀÏ·ò×Ó³´¼@Ìõ #12 Probably one of the most famous stalls in Old Airport Road, the queue grows quickly but the uncle also cooks quickly. The stall can be recognized by the music playing out of the boombox, and the auntie who takes orders very quickly. You can be the 10th person down the line and she's asking for your order! The kway teow was very wet and wasn't too oily, the flavour was there and I didn't eat chunks of lard but I could definitely taste the use of lard.  Xing Li Cooked Food ÐËÀûÊìÊ³ #28 Fried Oyster As mentioned by fellow yelper Dominic C, the fried egg is very gooey and isn't crispy, the cook definitely takes his own sweet time to cook the fried egg.  Jia Long Mei Shi #55 Chicken Wings The chicken wings were juicy and good, the auntie was very friendly and there was no queue. Got the food quickly and ate it quickly as well! Not a bad choice for chicken wings!  Kah Ping Ri Ye Xiang #87 Rojak Lots of big dough fritter pieces, all were crispy despite taking my time to slowly finish up the plate. The chilli can be quite spicy so beware. Lots of crushed peanut in every mouthful!  Ming Kee Fuzhou Fish Balls #109 (facing main road) Fuzhou fish balls have meat embedded in the fish ball which is nice! The meatballs are soft and bouncy and very flavourful. The soup is slightly more bland and comes with a small seaweed. They are served in portions of 6."

Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,20-Jan-18,"I'm so glad that my friend insisted I visit Singapore while doing my Winter Asia tour 2017. It's a pretty popular hawker (a term that means Chinatown complex) where you have two long rows of many different food options. FYI, it's hard to find napkins there so bring some with you. It was also hard for me to find trash bins so I found one attached to a juice stand and threw my trash there. I got scolded though since they could get fined for having random trash items in there. Very odd.  Anywho, I ordered some prawn noodles and dessert from two of the stands and left pretty full and satisfied. Another great eating place to come back for sure and try other stands!  They also have wifi there so that's a major plus!"
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,18-Jun-22,Good for variety and many authentic Singapore cuisine. Especially love the juicy BBQ chicken which you have to queue for quite some time
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",3,9-Sep-14,I know there are many good food stalls here but there are also many mediocre or average food stalls. So you do need to know where to go.  One such average food stall is #01-91 which sells congee or rice porridge. There are many varieties of porridge available and it does see a steady stream of customer who usually get it to go.  I like the options available for the century egg pork porridge. You could choose meatball or meat slices (I think). I had the meatball which was lovely. It came with a you tiao stick which was still crispy.  The dish not to order would be the raw fish salad. The small portion was miserable. One could hardly see the fish slices which were so thin they almost blended in with the disposable plate. I guess I am used to the versions served in Chinatown Food Center or even at Tekka Market Food Center which were more generous and cheaper too.
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,6-Nov-19,"old airport road, known as the most popular Hawker in Singapore, offers a wide selection of food across different price points depending on what you eat. I love eating here, but it also makes my indecisiveness a problem haha. Some of the stalls will sell out and close early, to make sure you get to try everything, go in a group and go for lunch instead of dinner. I've had a few times where I wanted to get roast meats there, but they sell out before dinner :("
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,14-Jun-16,A solid hawker centre if you're looking for a legit Singapore eating experience.  My current faves include:  #01-02: Hua Kee Hougang Famous Wan Ton Mee The $5 portion of the dumpling noodle fed this hungry preggo lady well! I could've shied away from the chilli but I figured it wouldn't do the dish justice if I skipped it. The dumplings were stuffed to the brim and delicious. Throw in the copious amount of al dente noodles in a bowl and it is BEST.  #01-12: Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow I love Char Kway Teow and am not very particular with my stalls. Just know this one does the dish justice.  #01-51: Waan Waan This is a Thai dessert spot that does coconut ice cream. Their dishes are quite refreshing in this Singapore heat; however they do try to upsell me sometimes even though I tell them straight up that I'm not interested... not a fan of that.  Next time I want to try some of the curry puff stalls and the banana fritter stall in the back!
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,9-Oct-16,"Plenty of stalls here to choose from. in fact if you have not make your mind up, you will be walking around for at least 30 minutes deciding what to eat. One of the best wonton noodle is located here, and there are two stalls. Which one is better you have to decide. There is a minced pork noodle soup, and it sells out fast. Get there after 2pm, the stall will be closed. There are at least two prawn noodle stalls here, again you have to decide which one is your favourite. Luckily there is only one rojak stall, get a queue number before you start your entree as the queue is super long. Don't forget the char koay thoew as well as the carrot cake. Again several better stalls at this hawkers center."

But overall the meat is cooked really well - moist, juicy meat, not too sweet or salty.  BNR Coffee Kopi C Kosong Bing - 4 stars Rich good flavor even without sugar. Would get less ice the next time.  Park at the multistorey carpark! The lanes are nice and wide compared to most other HDB carparks."

The hawker location had great food selection although this hawker was not my favorite just based on overall atmosphere."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,24-Jul-18,"Classic hawker center - known by locals to be one of SG's best. They serve a huge variety of food here with many good selections. Quite packed and a bit difficult to find seat for a large group but nonetheless a good place to visit to immerse in the true local experience  Reviews of some popular stalls I have been to per the below. - Dong Ji Fried Kuay Teow - the stir-fried noodle here has a nice wok smell but the line is long and moves slowly so gotta be patient - Lao Fu Zi Fried Kuay Teow - another fried kuay teow stall - this one has a stronger walk smell than Dong Ji but I personally prefer Dong Ji's seasoning of the noodle. A very good option nonetheless but super long slow line since they cook one dish at a time - Wen Wen Prawn Mee - average - nothing particularly special - Roast Paradise - really good BBQ pork - recommend - Nam Sing Hokkien Mee - usually I'm not a big fan of Hokkien Mee but this one is good - the noodle is not too soggy from the gravy and there's a hint of wok smell in the sauce. Long line. - Chuan kee satay - Ok / despite its popularity, I have had better satay elsewhere - Toa Payoh Rojak - personally not a Rojak fan but this is one of the better ones I have had - the ingredients were fresh and well-balanced. If you order with chili, it can indeed get spicy - Hua Kee Wanton Meat - good / comforting wonton noodles - not mindblowing but a safe good bet - 51 Soya Bean - a good place for traditional SG/Chinese dessert - try the tao huey (cold tofu pudding) - Sugar Cane Juice - a classic SG refreshment for a hot day"

I had wanted to try Hokkien Mee or fried kway Teow but both were closed. This lor Mee had a very long line so I tried it. It was very very good, worth the wait. $5 good portion.  Came again and had Nam Seng Hokkien Mee (3-1/2*)--it's hard to find a good Hokkien Mee. It's okay and better than many places. $5 small. Not much wok hei.  Toa Payoh Rojak is passable.

Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,13-Dec-14,"Old Airport Road FC was my first experience of a hawker center in Singapore during my trip in November... and it surely did not disappoint. My friends brought me here and basically said ""go!"" and I had absolutely no idea what to get. It was so overwhelming since everything looked so damn good and there were new dishes that I wasn't accustomed to, being American and all.  We ate a variety of delights here, from the classic char kway teow to braised intestines (I love intestines... don't judge). I also had my first Lao Ban dessert here - SO GOOD. We also had oyster omelette - the oysters were fat and juicy and the omelette wasn't overly greasy or anything. The only thing I wasn't too much of a fan of was the Hokkien noodles.... a little bit too ocean-tasting for me.  Too bad I couldn't really tell you which stalls these things came from, but I don't think you can go wrong with any of the food here. Lots of soups, noodles, desserts, and drinks - enough to leave you in a food coma for the rest of the night. I can't complain about a place that sells a bazillion types of food.... only thing I can complain about is that it's not in an air conditioned building (haha)."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,26-Jan-16,"My first Hawker's center turned out to be my favorite and one of the highlights of my Asia trip. Great food and good layout.  Highlights: - Chay kway teow: mixed type of noodles in a soy like sauce was a hit. 5 stars. - Hor fun: wide rice noodles with gravy. 5 stars. - Carrot cake: rice patties with egg and a brown sauce was one of my faves. 5 stars - Meatball bao: soft bun and tasty big meatball hiding inside. 4.5 stars - Black pepper puff: didn't care that much about the famous curry puff but loved the black pepper version inside of the thick flaky exterior. 4.5 stars - Fresh juices: so good, I got 3. Blend the fruit with a bit of ice right there. 5 stars - Tofu: silky and just a bit sweet of a dessert. Meant to eat a few spoonfuls but almost ate the whole container. 4.5 stars - Noodles with minced meat: with and without soup with linguine type noodles were great. 4 stars - Layout: 2 long aisles with seating in between and outside under umbrellas  Lowlights: - Few stalls closed on Sunday - Need coins to pay last for the toilet - My friend wanted fresh fruit for his kid but couldn't find it anywhere  Got my 2 week trip off to an awesome start blissfully happy trying all of these dishes and would love to come back again."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,24-Mar-17,"My favourite hawker in Singapore in terms of choice (although Chinatown Complex has the craft beer stalls in its favour). Worth noting there is a covered path all the way there from Dakota MRT (but not Mountbatten).  I'll update the list over time. Best: - Yi Ji vs Nam Sing (fried hokkien mee): both are worth trying. I personally prefer the fishier, sweeter Yi Ji and its pungent chilli. There's something fun about the brusk service as well. Nam Sing is an impressively professional operation and the prawns have a slight edge. - Geylang Lor 20 banana fritters: looks unassuming but these are very sweet, soft bananas. Love it. I'm not a fan of the larger, less ripe pisang goreng though. - Lim Hin fruits/juice: the soursop juice (""classic"") is phenomenal. This stall is supposed to be quite picky with their fruit and it shows. Good soursop is one of the best things about living here. I never thought a simple soursop juice would make my ""top 10 meals of 2017"" list.  OK: - Lao Fu Zi char kway teow (black): not as much wok hei as I'd have imagined from the giant wok, perhaps because outside rush hour. Still, this CKT has good ingredients and is on the sweet side. Can't wait to try Dong Ji. - Sin Thor Bak Koot Teh: a well executed, but not standout braised pig leg. I'm biased due to the closure of the two BKT stalls near my home, meaning any BKT finds favour at the moment."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,7-Jan-16,"This hawker center is a bit out of the way, but worth the stop if you have time! After visiting a couple of other hawker centers, this one was your typical place of various food stalls and such. Do note, that if you need to go to the restroom, it will cost you ten cents to do so.  For most of the food here, the options vary from porridge to pasta to the typical dishes you see at hawker centers. I didn't know what to get so I conducted a small experiment. Instead of ordering whatever looks good to me, I simply chatted with some of the locals and ordered food based on their recommendations. Result? Everything I got was DELICIOUS. One of my favorite items was the Thai style noodle dish with wonton soup. The stall was located in a dark ish looking corner of the place. The wonton soup = yummylicious. The broth was perfectly seasoned and the wontons itself were savory and filling. For only $4, you get both the wonton soup + the noodles. Noodle dish was quite tasty, with the fresh cut BBQ pork and the seasonings on the dish wasn't too overwhelming. For other small dishes I tried, I really enjoyed the curry flavored puff and the fried dumpling. For the puff, the outside was nice and flaky while the inside tasted legitimately like good Thai yellow curry with its potatoes and chicken. As for the fried dumpling, this was surprisingly filling! The inside was mostly chicken, potatoes and small veggies and it had a nice spicy kick to it.  Overall, I really like the vibe of this place. You don't see too many tourists and the locals are friendly and nice to talk to. Not sure if it was the time we went (late afternoon), but there was hardly a long wait (except for one stall in particular) for most of the food stalls. Definitely a relaxing eating experience at this hawker center."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,11-May-14,"We ate here after hearing many great stories of the local food stalls within the hallowed portals of the Old Airport Road Food Centre. We were on the hunt for my new local favorite Singapore dish, Char Kway Teow and settled on unit#1 30. The stall was named Lucky and their specialty was spelled differently as Char Kuay Tiao. Minor details aside, we ordered two plates of Char Kway Teow with chili. The drink stall across the crowded way crammed with tables and people was playing Classic Rock and had Carlsberg on special offer. We also ordered a couple of drinks from the juice stall beside our Lucky stall.  The food was great. Great flavor of cockles, Chinese chives, bean sprouts and flat noodles all cooked in light and dark soy sauce. Just the right amount of spiciness and a good sized portion. What's not to love. Washed down with Carlsberg and Soursop and Plum juice listening to old Aerosmith and ACDC, our visit was a resounding success. Cannot wait to go back."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,19-Oct-19,Lots of stalls here and plenty of seats. I like the dry noodles stall that is on the outside corner of the center and also the fried bananas were yummy here. Definitely would visit again when in singapore.
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,28-Dec-13,"One of my favourite Hawker Centres!  Do try: Lao Fu Zi Char Kueh Teow - worth the long line!! Lao Ban Dou Hua Chee Cheong Fun Sliced fish bee hoon Lor Mee  At night, the satay, zi char, hokkien mee, rojak stall are all pretty decent. I must say, Old Airport Road is one of those hawker centres with the most stalls selling pretty decent local delicacies!"
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,9-Feb-17,"A great friend from Thailand came for a visit and we decided to go for a good simple meal at this food center. There is incredible variety of food, but I'm going to give a review specifically of Wen Wen pork rib prawn Mee stall 01-147. We had a steamboat of crab, prawns, clams, pork ribs, intestines and pig tails. The base stock was crazy good with intense flavors of prawn and pork. After the ingredients were eaten, the stock became extra rich with even more intense flavors, this time with crab and clams into the mix. The owner is Richard, a thoroughly nice guy. The place and ambience is well, hawker center. But here you can also bring your own stuff, vegetables, abalone or whatever and just throw into the pot. Richard won't charge you extra. Highly recommended and very affordable. One hint, better come before October 2017 as he will move to Kallang market."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,22-May-17,Many good foods and is very crowded . Tried lor mee but is quite normal and over hyped. Toa payoh rojak is good now is not so crowded. Kueh chap is delicious Fried prawn noodle is good. Fried Kway lau foo Che is a bit dry. Paste cheap and good. Beer is cheap. Bbq pork is delicious. Satay good.
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",3,11-Sep-13,"Had the lor mee (#116) and fried kway teow (#12) - which also both had long queues. The lor mee was excellent and much better than it looked! But the kway teow ($4 portion) was only ok and the portions were tiny!  You can add cilantro and chilis and black vinegar to the lor mee, which I highly recommend."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,20-Feb-13,"There are so many great food stalls in this Hawker.

But no matter what local craving you have, this is the place to go to satisfy it!"
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,3-Jan-16,"I came here first time today. It seems many good eating shops are there, but I tried my most favorite food in Singapore, Fried Hokken Prawn Mee. Very good!"
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",3,18-Apr-15,This food centre seems a bit out of the way which is good because it wasn't too crowded on a Friday afternoon but bad because I need that crowd to know where to go. I feel so helpless if there are no lines of any sort to help me make the very important decision about what to eat.  I settled on some curry chicken and bread which was good. Plenty of seating both inside and out.
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,9-Oct-14,"It is a better hawker centre in the day than at night. Most of the more popular stalls are actually closed at night.  As in most hawker centers in Singapore, you bring with you some patience and join any stall that has a line, that will be your best bet.  My personal favorites: - Nan xing Hokkien fried noodles (because they do the version that I prefer that has more bee Hoon than yellow noodles) - peanut pancake - kway chap - carrot cake/oyster omelette stall facing the front entrance"
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,16-Sep-12,"* My favourite hawker centre *  When in Singapore I'm in hole in the wall heaven with all of the amazing inexpensive hawker centres. This one is at the top of my list on every visit.  Over the years some of my best meals in Singapore have been here. Highlights are one of the absolute best black pepper crabs I have had in my life, a wonderful char keow teow that had that lovely wok hei as well as some of the most flavourful Chinese sausage I've had, wonderful laksa, and a smooth fresh tofu that I can still taste.  I passed on the crocodile foot soup that I saw on a past visit, and didn't see it again after that. Darn!"
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",2,12-Jul-15,"Went there at 10.45 am on a Sunday hoping to skip the lunch crowd but it's already bustling with lots of people. There is a 1 hour wait for the famous fried Hokkien Mee and so we went around looking for other alternatives instead. Guess it's the hot weather and the packed crowd, the porridge stall holder we went to that also make hand made Chee Cheong Fun with filling, is super grumpy. She even shouted at her mom who do the finishing touches before handing the food to the customers.  End of the trip, I've decided not to visit this place again. Sadly it's not a place that I want to go and feel good."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,7-Aug-12,"My favourite hawker centre of all time. Why does anybody go to Newton? This is THE shit.  There's everything here including great kway chap (Blanco Court), char kway teow (Lao Fu Zi), lor mee (Xin Mei Xiang) and Hokkien mee (Nam Sing). Also the now famous Lao Ban beancurd with its equally crazy queues. The only downside about eating at a food centre like this with so many all-stars: I can't think of any other food centre where you have to queue so much, no matter what you are ordering! On the bright side, even if you didn't want to queue for the 'famous' stalls, the less famous stalls which offer the same types of food tend to be quite good too. Nothing really sucks, I think. Not sure if that's a safe proclamation to make.  My new favourite stall here is the under-rated Chuan Loo Bee Hokkien stall which is opposite the Lao Ban beancurd stall. It sells some of the best -- and cheapest -- seafood and zichar I have ever seen. I love the black pepper crabs, hotplate egg omelette and beancurd and pretty much everything they've got.  Wash down the huge feast (any combination of things here, put together, necessarily constitutes a feast!) with a beer or sugar cane juice and mark it down as the quintessential Singapore experience. Do your tourist friends a favour and take them here, not Newton!"
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,7-Aug-12,"Oh the sinful memories. I used to work very near Old Airport Road and had lunch there almost everyday. I believe this should be stated as a major job perk if my office was hiring.  The place's divided into 3 rows. My colleagues and I always call it row 1 - facing the road, 2 or 3 - against the wall to differentiate the stalls.  There's a wonderfully juicy chicken chop at row 3, the chicken is succulent and never fails to emerge with glistering skin and an intoxicating grilled aroma. On the same row, there's a small stall that sells goreng pisang and fried nian gao (aka rice cake) and fried - get this - DURIAN. It is amazing. In row 1, there are two battling stalls of wanton mee, apparently each stall has their own loyal following - can tell from the queue.  The thing about hawker food is that everything's so affordable; every meal there can easily spiral out of control and become a little feast. Not that I'm complaining."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,23-Feb-13,"A must go when visiting Singapore! I absolutely loved the vibe of the place, which is where you can go to see how the locals eat. Food is so inexpensive, at 2-3 USD a plate. Lines stretch over half an hour for the most popular stalls at peak times. Definitely try the famous Hougang Mee noodles, the Hougang Otah, Fatman Satay (only evenings), Fish Soup, Char Kway Teow and Fried Oyster Omelette stalls! Many of the stalls at this food center have been opened for over 30 years, although few retain their original owners to this date. The food is still super tasty!  Also, the crazy line at the back of the food center is probably for Lao Ban bean curd dessert and soy drinks, I've seen more than 40 people lining up and their product is really different than other local versions. This one has an almond taste to it and a very custard texture, which is unlike the soy milk quality that their competitors produce. Beat the crowd by going at 11am or 530pm before the locals come eat!  Payment is always in cash and local currency, so leave your credit cards at home."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,3-Sep-12,"Absolutely adore this place. All my favourite foods in a hawker centre-space just slightly larger than Maxwell Market, packed with the famous Hougang Wan Ton Mee, Lao Ban Tau Huey, delicious traditional Chinese desserts (like the pastes, chng tng, gingko barley soup), bak kut teh, tze char, Lor Mee (!!!), Chicken Rice, Pig Organ Soup (not my cup of tea but fans love the ones here!), complete with fruit juice & drink vendors thrown in (and the occasional duplicate/bandwagon stores, which are totally legit and yummy as well!).  Easy to get to, Dakota/Mountbatten MRT, 20 minute bus ride from the city... envious of people who live in the vicinity and get to have all these local delicacies in their disposal till late in the night..."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,24-Sep-17,Enjoyed a cheap snack when transferring and staying there for a day! Cheap and filing! A nice touch!
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,15-May-13,"Ahhh, the hawker centre with the Hokkien mee stall that's more elusive than a French Laundry table. It's called Nam Sing, and it's store number #01-32 and you MUST call him first at +65 6440 5340 before coming. If the uncle doesn't pick up the phone, don't bother coming. If he picks up the phone, make sure you ask if there are still a lot of noodles left. I had the unfortunate experience when I made sure that they were open, but they were sold out by the time I got there!  Other than Nam Sing, there are several other famous stalls here such as:  - Xin Mei Xiang Lor Mee - Lao Fu ZI Kway Teow - Toa Payoh Rojak - Lao Ban Soya Beancurd Etc etc  But for me, I always go for the Hokkien mee. IMO the best in Singapore, where the noodles is very eggy and it's cooked like an al dente pasta."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,30-Sep-15,"Best food court I've tried so far. The wanton stall had an awesome pork and shrimp dumpling soup. Also had their spicy noodle on the side which was perfect. The tried a lime juice fresh from the cold drink stall. Also amazing! Totally refreshing and not too sour/tart. Lastly grabbed a hot red paste bun from the only place selling hot buns in there which was so fluffy and perfectly hot and topped with sesame seeds, white and black. I will definitely be back! All for the low low price of 4.90 for all of the above :)"
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,3-Jun-17,Old airport just open Hock Lam Beef noodles. Different from the actual well known same name Beef noodles.

Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,6-Mar-13,"Lots of good eats within one place! I'd always heard about the wonders of Old Airport Rd hawker centre but never traipsed over east-ish (it's actually not that far east, even) to try it out. But since a colleague from abroad was here visiting, we made the pilgrimage down!  1. Lao Fu Zi Fried Kway Teow #01-12 (2nd row of stalls, kind of in the middle) is certainly da bomb.. Deliciousness! $3 for a plate, not an overwhelming lot, but probably enough saturated fats to last for a while, unfortunately. Noodles were well fried and slid down your throat, with a suitable amount of sweetness from the sweet black soy. This stall has a combination of kway teow noodles (the flat rice noodles) and thick round yellow noodle (I can't figure out the name, unfortunately, this website calls it ), which isn't found everywhere. My two female colleagues baulked when they saw me approaching the table with 2 plates of $3 noodles (this, as recommended by an uncle standing in line in front of me when I asked for a $5 plate- he convinced me that 2 $3 plates was more worth it - I guess it's true! Didn't make the lady boss any happier, certainly). However, the six of us devoured almost all of it..  2. Mattar Seafood Barbecue #01-63 (3rd row of stalls, right at the back) a. Chilli crab was not bad, colleagues liked it a lot and preferred it to Jumbo's. It is also cheaper, at $40/kg. We got 2 for $61, not too bad I guess! And yay for mantous.. 50cents each. Although still can't beat the Forture Seafood ones. Those are gigantic and fluffy and heaven on earth! b. Stir fried greens with mushrooms ($8) was also pretty good - we just asked for whatever green veg they had and she supplied us with puay leng (chinese spinach) with mushrooms with a delicate light sauce! c. Sambal stingray ($16) from them was unfortunately so-so, the stingray was okay but the sambal was somewhat lacklustre. Pity about that!  3. Guan Kee Seafood (#01-66) a. Cereal prawns ($13 I think) were delicious! I forget how many prawns they gave us though. b. Pork ribs king ($12) was not that great. Tender pieces, but not much flavour."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,27-Aug-12,"Old Airport Road Food Centre is where I bring my friends from overseas for a taste of local food. With a wide variety of stalls all housed under one roof, this place is home of my favourite hokkien mee, wan ton mee and hand made cheong fun. There is also the hugely popular Lao Ban tau huay alongside many traditional dessert stalls. The hokkien mee in the 3rd row, can't remember what it is called exactly, is absolutely divine! However, the wait for it can go up to 1.5 hours during busy periods!  It gets pretty crowded on weekends and finding a table and parking can be pretty difficult, so planning for an early dinner/lunch may help you avoid some of the crowd."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,25-Aug-12,"Old Airport Road Food Centre is the place to go for cheap and good food under 1 roof. The huge compound holds more than a hundred stalls ranging from savory to sweet, small snacks to hearty meals, local to western cuisine.  Some hot favorites are the 2 competing wanton mee stores at the left end of the complex. Cho Kee and another stall. They even have their electronic queue display.  There is a hand made chee cheong fun stall (i'm not sure what's its name). It's in the second block, the second row from the main road. There's always a long queue for this one. Melt in your mouth rice rolls with char siew or prawns or scallops and topped with a light soy and shallots. Yums.  Other great stuff includes lor mee, Lao Ban beancurd, Albert Street Prawn mee and more. Char Kway teow is apparently very popular too."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",3,9-Sep-12,"This place has an INSANE amount of choices, I am completely lost everytime I am here. At least count, there must be at least 5 stalls selling the same food - char kway teow, wanton noodles, western, etc. I don't come here enough even though my school used to be near.  Some picks: Satay vermicelli (you don't get this very often around anymore), wanton noodles, fried kway teow (don't bother queuing, go for the ones without), 51 beancurd and round off with a glass of sugarcane juice. My colleagues pick the cantonese porridge and Western food stall.  I'm only ranking this a-ok because I think I need to explore this place more before I make my decision."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",3,26-Aug-12,"Mention ""old airport road"" and everybody will know that you are referring to the legendary hawker food centre near Katong which has probably one of the highest concentration of good local food. It is also very huge - spanning 3 rows of stalls in a space that is probably the size of a football field or bigger.  Seating will be a challenge most times especially on weekends. However this is when group work comes in. One can sit, the others can start to queue to buy the food.  Of course the famous Lao Ban beancurd will come to mind since they originated here. However there are also other notable stalls such as Lao Fu Zi fried kway teow and Whitley Road Big Prawn noodles. The TPY Rojak and Hokee Wanton Noodles are also very good. The Western BBQ stall also has great chicken chops.  If you are unsure of what to eat, just join the stall with a queue and you can't be wrong."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,23-Apr-15,"I used to come here a lot when I was in Secondary school. So this place brings back lots of memories. Seems like everyone is raving about the CKT.. so here's my take on two of them. Let me start with Lucky Char Kway Teow. According to the owner, the stall has been in operation for seven years and they have various recommendations as seen plastered around the stallfront. The CKT here is less than saucy i.e. dry in a good way. I like that the lupcheong (chinese sausages) were given in ample amounts and the taste was strong and distinct from the rest of the noodles. The noodles were pleasant and would give it a 3.5-4 stars. Opposite Lucky on the second last row of stalls on the west side of the hawker center is Laofuzi CKT(with a green sign). There's always a queue regardless of the time of the day and many have sworn by this CKT. I find wouldn't drive like hours to just eat this.. its just okay. The noodles are quite delicious when eaten hot, and the 'hum'/ cockle just rounds off the taste. I love hums.  No trip to OARFC is complete without Laoban soya bean. There's 51 a competitor and much cheaper but the taste at Laoban is just superior. It has a strong bean taste that some may call 'plasticky?' but i really like it. Choose the small cup ($1) of soy bean milk for a filling and wholesome thirst-quencher."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",4,22-Oct-14,"Fairly standard hawker center with a big selection of more Chinese and Singapore type flavors. I wish there were a few Indian options, but what is here is pretty good. Good fish ball soup, seafood salad, prawns, and other seafood choices. Not many beer choices either. Make sure to bring your tissues to hold a table as it gets fairly crowded at meal times."
Old Airport Road Food Centre,4.3,67,"Hawker Centre, Food Court",5,27-Nov-13,"Old Airport Road is probably the coolest hawker centre I've been to in Singapore. If you're looking to do it right, go for dinner, eat as little as possible beforehand (I know, near impossible if you're visiting Singapore), and buy as many things as possible here. If you're a tourist, it's about a 10 minute walk from the MRT."

I would say it reminds me more of Canadian bagels than NY bagels but honestly in SG, this is already amazing haha.  Flavors are a bit on the salty side and veryyyy messy to eat.

To note, there is very little seating especially now that it's COVID, so plan accordingly. I went on a rainy day at around 10:30am and there were a few people in line so I'm guessing can be quite popular and crowded normally."

I've never actually had any other bagels in Singapore, so I feel pretty comfortable saying that these must be the best that the island has to offer! ;) I normally always spring for the lox bagel, but the menu is so inventive and interesting that I decided to try something a little different: the Hawaiian bagel - spam, chutney, egg, sriracha aioli & greens... no cheese for me because I really don't like it. All on an onion bagel. It was easily was of the messiest bagels I've ever eaten, but also one of the best (comparable to the one I've had in New York). Just everything was perfect. The onion bagel was crispy and just the perfect amount of onion, the spam, chutney, etc. combination was really great and tasty. Everything tasted fresh, which is weird to say about spam, but you know, everything else tasted fresh. I was kind of sad my bagel was over. I know I mentioned their menu was interesting but I definitely feel it warrants another mention: I haven't gone to a bagel place with such a wide offering - it's usually pretty boring, typical stuff, but Two Men Bagel House offers so much more (I mean, corn chowder soup bagel? Like what even? Give me some of that!! And who the hell doesn't want to eat something called Hot Mess?). I legit wish I had more time to stick around and try something else!  I almost forgot to say: though you order up front and then grab a seat, the staff at the counter were hilarious as well, cracking jokes with us - really great service and made for a good atmosphere."
Two Men Bagel House,4.8,22,"Breakfast & Brunch, Bagels",5,21-Dec-18,"Amazing bagels! I've never actually had any other bagels in Singapore, so I feel pretty comfortable saying that these must be the best that the island has to offer! ;) I normally always spring for the lox bagel, but the menu is so inventive and interesting that I decided to try something a little different: the Hawaiian bagel - spam, chutney, egg, sriracha aioli & greens... no cheese for me because I really don't like it. All on an onion bagel. It was easily was of the messiest bagels I've ever eaten, but also one of the best (comparable to the one I've had in New York). Just everything was perfect.

Love the bagel with SPAM, tastes amazing with all the luncheon meat goodness. Thumbs up also to their in house roasted meats, the birdie (chicken) bagel was incredible, fragrantly roasted and well seasoned. The meat platter had very generous portions and all of it together, formed a very heavy lunch that filled us to the brink - just wished that we didn't have to go back to work with such a full stomach after that. The mango smoothie deserves a special mention for it's refreshing taste with just the right amount of sweet and chill to balance the meaty tastes, all set in a casual alfresco dining experience for cosy chit chat with friends, enjoyable!"

Sawasdee,4.1,9,Thai,5,7-Sep-23,"Omg I'm so blessed to have found this thai restaurant that understands gluten free and dairy free so well including coeliac! Just make sure speak to the staff prior ordering if you're coeliac. Better be safe than sorry  Pad thai is one of the recommended item and yes it didn't disappoint overall! Portion was great for 1pax and texture was just nice! Prawn was little soft but it's okay for me. Just personal liking I would prefer it to be less sweet :) and their lychee soda is not the artificial but real lychee .  I didn't get her name but she speaks fluent English, she's really great in communicating allergen and menu recommendation and even recommending me a nearby bar that serves natural wine (for folks like me who can't drink typical alcohol but yes do your own research).  I wanted to try more than just pad thai and with her recommendation, I went with the pork skewer bites. Can't wait to try it out tomorrow as I intentionally ordered this grilled pork skewer for tomorrow lunch.  I wanted to order MORE as I got real excited with their good amount of GF DF options and the she was kind enough to hold me back from over-ordering ! Just love her honesty. I will definitely be back and try more of their gluten and dairy free options!  Thanks for making our (allergy folks) life a little brighter!  Psst: I came around 9:30pm on a weekday so fortunately not much crowd and thus very fast serving. She did mention the peak hours is around 7-8pm-ish and waiting time can be up to 20mins."
Sawasdee,4.1,9,Thai,4,25-Aug-23,"Had a beer, pad Lee mao and chicken skewer/satay. Came here as they are opening in the morning. Not bad. Recommended for quick bite."
Sawasdee,4.1,9,Thai,5,11-Feb-22,This is my go to place whenever I am in SG. Was a regular here almost everyday for dinner until the pandemic. The owners and their children are extremely kind and welcoming and the food is delectable. I am so happy that I stumbled upon this place!!!

Sawasdee,4.1,9,Thai,5,2-Apr-18,"This is my 2nd visit to Sawasdee. The first time I visited was in 2015 and I was not a vegan. I actually took a picture of the menu because it was so good. I wanted to make sure that if I ever returned to Singapore, I would return to eat at this restaurant. Fast forward 2 1/2 Years later I returned, but this time as a vegan. I was sooo happy to find out they have a vegan menu! The food was so awesome I returned for a 2nd visit before I left the country!"
Sawasdee,4.1,9,Thai,4,7-Mar-15,"Nice small restaurant, located nort part of Chinatown near the Indian Temple.

Beer bottlewas perfectly opened and ice cold :)"
Sawasdee,4.1,9,Thai,3,10-Nov-19,We had the Mango sticky rice. Taste was good but overpriced. We paid 12$ for one mango sticky rice
Sawasdee,4.1,9,Thai,2,24-Nov-10,"The food at this street restaurant in Chinatown is actually quite good and authentic, but there are some good reasons not to go there: the bill contains a hand-written total without any explanation of how this (high!) amount was calculated. And you can wait forevr if you ask them for a receipt. Service is unfriendly. Payment is only in cash. About 1 year later: the restaurant has moved to a busier Chinatown street, but has not lost any of its tricks. Thai coffee was simply coffee with icecubes, and the sticky rice with mango I ordered was counted as a large one although it definitely was a small one!"
Sawasdee,4.1,9,Thai,4,13-Sep-13,"I'm not really proud of this, but I went to this place three nights in a row. The first night was just on a whim because it was hot and they had cold Singha beer on display. So I had to have three or four. While I was sitting there I decided to come back for dinner the next night. And I did - dinner was great. But I left my credit card there. So the next night I came back to get it and couldn't resist eating it again. The food. My first dinner was huge - I ate a complete order of sambal fried rice, spring rolls, and chicken with chili and basil. The spring rolls were mediocre; I should've ordered the ""fresh"" spring rolls (that's what I meant to order but I didn't realize I needed to differentiate). The fried rice - which I got with pork - was super spicy and very good. The chicken with chili basil was very flavorful as well, but the chicken was cut up into little bits and then fried kinda like larb but smaller so it was almost like eating little bits of fried breading rather than meat. But we are in Singapore and chickens are not supplied by fosters farms I guess. My third night (second dinner) I just got a bowl of red tom yum soup with shrimp. When asked for a spice preference I requested medium. This soup came out looking sort of evil yellowish with red oil dots floating on it. But I'm not afraid of evil so I jump in and I'm immediately loving the deep flavor and robust spices. But you either have to eat very fast or pull the peppers out early, or else your soup will evolve from medium to god damn volcano hot. Or order another Singha and slurp it down slow. I give these guys a 4-star rating for their excellent customer service (calling me and texting me after I left my number saying that I couldn't find my credit card) and also that the food is really quite good despite being in the middle of a tourist trap area (Pagoda road). Good place to go get a beer other than Tiger!!"

I walked in just on a hunch after passing a few probably competent places.........the food was delicious, as good as any Sichuan restaurant anywhere. I had the spicy beef soup - great ""ma"" and great ""la"" on my taste buds.  It is entirely Mandarin speaking.....so make friends with your neighbors if you need help. But the menu is in photos.....the mama is friendly and accommodating, and wow so good."
Old Chengdu Sichuan Cuisine,4.1,12,"Szechuan, Imported Food",5,1-Oct-17,"Amaaaazing Sichuan Chinese Food. We went here on Saturday and had to come again the next day because the food was just so good. Our favorites were the spicy chili chicken, the eggplant and the potatoe dish - yuuum. If you are in China Town (or acutally anywhere else in Singapore) I really recommend this restaurant."
Old Chengdu Sichuan Cuisine,4.1,12,"Szechuan, Imported Food",4,16-Jan-16,"This is one of the two Szechuan cuisine places I will go to satisfy my craving for numbing spicy Szechuan food, the other being Si Wei Mao Cai.  These two places serve pretty authentic Szechuan food and the portion is pretty generous, hence the higher price per serving.  For this place, I usually get the chicken with chillis and a spicy bullfrog dish. Their chicken with chillis is very tasty, chicken fried just nice and the taste of the spices, garlic and chillis balance well to produce the flavorful and numbing chicken. They are very generous with their garlic, hence for garlic fans like me, this is a big plus.  Their bullfrog on the other hand was not as fantastic as their chicken with chillis. We ordered the spicy and numbing bullfrog where the frog legs were literally drowned in the chilli oil, and the gravy within could not get into the frog legs, hence most of the time I just tasted oily spicy frog legs. No doubt the frog legs were fresh, but the gravy did not enhance the taste farther and it was rather disjointed. I would say it's an average dish.  The previous time I was here, I ordered their spicy catfish dish which came in a huge portion. It could feed about 3-4 pax and the gravy was flavorful. What you should do is order dumplings or rice to go with this and you can enjoy the gravy at the same time.  Overall, I would highly recommend this place, as I would usually take the trouble to write reviews for places that are worth writing for (against if it's really bad)."
Old Chengdu Sichuan Cuisine,4.1,12,"Szechuan, Imported Food",1,24-Feb-18,"Wouldn't go there again! The waitresses don't speak any English and we had to wait for someone else to translate. I asked for no onions on my plate, even showed her the ""no onion"" translation in Chinese in Google Translate (which works even in China btw), she confirmed and I still got onions. The food took ages to arrive and I ordered rice! In a Chinese restaurant! My girlfriend was also not satisfied with her food and it's definitely overpriced for what you get."
Old Chengdu Sichuan Cuisine,4.1,12,"Szechuan, Imported Food",3,18-Feb-18,"Went here on Chinese New Year weekend. The food was not as great as I was hoping from the reviews. Ordered the eggs and tomato dish, dumplings, and beef fried rice. Could have just been an off night for them as perhaps they were busy during the day. The fried was okay, but prob won't be back. Location is convenient right off the subway in Chinatown. Pretty pricey for what you get."
Old Chengdu Sichuan Cuisine,4.1,12,"Szechuan, Imported Food",5,24-Nov-13,"Came here with a group of 30+ people. Rounds tables upstairs are ideal for large parties. We were able to fit 12-15 people each table very cozily.  Thanks to the generous amount of chili and peppercorn used in each dish, it was one of the most spiciest experiences in my life! They say ""spicy in, spicy out."" Oh man, we'll find out soon enough..  The undisputed favorite at our table was the Steamed Fish with yellow bean sprouts and chili (see my photo). Another favorite was the stir fried String Bean with chili. The plain and simple Eggs & Tomatoes were amazing, but mainly because it was the only non-spicy dish at our table!  The location of this restaurant is convenient. It's right next to the Chinatown MRT. Exit the opposite side of People's Park and turn to your left. Bam. Time to spicy! Be prepared to have steam blow out from your ears."
Old Chengdu Sichuan Cuisine,4.1,12,"Szechuan, Imported Food",4,1-Feb-15,Great food. Spicy. We always go with someone who speaks mandarin as don't think much English is spoken. But easy menu and good selection of food. Near MRT so easy to get to. They never disappoint in taste. Service is just ok.

Very good portions and dishes are cheaper than some of the Zi char stalls and in good quantity.

Very authentic.

The place is located in China town and has a second floor that accommodate large tables. We had 9 people and everyone thoroughly enjoyed all the dishes. My favorite is the snail, the husband and wife cold dish, and Sichuan cold noodle. My family also enjoyed Kong Pao Shrimp."

Hambaobao serves up a great portion of food that is suited to anybody who enjoys a great juicy burger.  Personally I love the fish burger. It's fantastic with that roasted pepper flavour which makes it just perfect.  Ayam Buah Kulak is for sure not for everybody but not bad in my opinion.  Fries? Addictive. Simple, homemade with skin on. Love it.  It's at a hawker so be prepared for the heat and at peak periods the wait can be quite a while but hey, it's worth it."
Hambaobao,4.3,10,Burgers,5,26-Apr-23,"Hidden gem within Singapore! Ryan and his family are pleasure to be around. Outside of the amazing food, the conversations were incredible. We ended up there 3 times in our 3 week trip the Singapore."
Hambaobao,4.3,10,Burgers,5,7-May-16,"Delicious burgers, low price. Definitely a place to enjoy burgers. Full burgers without the $$$. Basic beef burger cost $5, with hand cut fries.  Other extras like salad, cheese, bacon & patty cost $1 to $2.50. Be prepared to wait for as long as a half hour without the AC.  I had a classic beef without the extra stuff to see for myself if it was worth it compared to other burgers that cost more than an $100 bucks.  My final verdict? Best in the world! For all those foodie out there, come quick..."
Hambaobao,4.3,10,Burgers,4,30-Sep-17,"Good burgers, freshly made from fresh ingredients, but be careful of the long wait. I'm being generous with the 4 stars, should only be a 3 half. I wouldn't mind eating it again, but not with the long wait.  The standard cheese burgers are good. Very good. I can't say i have tasted them, but judging by how quickly the kids walloped them, without letting me have a bite, they must have been very good.  The speciality burger they have is the buah keluak burger. It's a bit of an enigma though. They have minced the chicken, curry, and buah keluak into a patty. Very clever, very innovative. It is served in a soft hamburger bun with chap chai as the garnish. Again very clever, very fusion. The first bite is a delight, as the sheer novelty of it surprises you. The flavour of the buah keluak is accurate, worthy of any Peranakan. The 2nd bite is still okay. But that's where my interests starts to waiver. Some how as a burger, it just doesn't work. Perhaps it's the richness of the flavour, or the heaviness of it. It just didn't make a good burger, and I didn't enjoy it.  Will be sticking to the standard burgers next time."
Hambaobao,4.3,10,Burgers,4,6-Jun-16,"An interesting name given to a stall that reminds me of the childhood days whereby the word ""HamBaoBao"" when translated from Mandarin literally refers to Hamburger. I guess during my era, any kid will be very happy to hear about this word.  I was in fact looking forward to the Ayam Buah Keluak Burger but just too bad that it was sold out during the time of vist and we was given a keychain to wait for our food.   Be prepared to wait a little longer if you are ordering the crispy Pork Belly burger as the pork belly will be cooked base on order basis. The pork belly was well marinated and was definitely tasty in its crispy skin layer. Mustard was added to the pork belly to give a spicy kick while the refreshing cool slices of cucumber strike a good balance to burger. Another highlight was its fluffy light butter grilled burger buns which was deliciously good.  Crispy Pork Belly - $5  The Classic Beef burger was not too bad either with beef patty, cheese, homemade tomato sauce, pickles as well as lettuce. Buns were similar prepared with butter just like any other burgers in the menu,  The Classic Beef - $5  It was good to see young local faces in the hawkers nowadays taking up the challenge working longer hours. Food is rather comforting with innovations of creating burger out of the ordinary and price wise, I would consider pocket friendly.  Fred not if you are caught in the queue and need to ease your hunger quick, there are few other stalls like Top 1 Homemade Noodle, Penang Home Made Beef Ball, Feng Ji Shu Shi Char Kway Teow that you might not want to miss out."
Hambaobao,4.3,10,Burgers,5,10-Mar-16,"Love the buns. Tried the pork belly and the ayam. Ayam is not for everyone but I did enjoy it. Pork belly was good!!! It was crispy, even when I ordered it for take away!  Oh best of all. Fries are hand cut/made.  Can't wait to try the others!"
Hambaobao,4.3,10,Burgers,5,8-Aug-18,Very yummy sandwiches at a great price. Can't go wrong. It's on the top level of the beauty world shopping center. I had the fish sandwich which was delicious and really juicy and tender.
Hambaobao,4.3,10,Burgers,5,19-Jun-16,"Really, really nice burgers. I had the That Dory Fish and my Son had The Classic Beef. Both of us found it outstanding and we paid $5 a pop. The 25 minute queue explained what the fuss is all about. Die die must try category and 5/5 for the team that dishes these out"
Hambaobao,4.3,10,Burgers,3,11-Jun-17,"The good: cheap burger with quality ingredients! The bad: they are slow and the wait could be 20-30 min. To be fair they tell you up front and give you good estimates as to when your burger will be ready. Also, the burger patty tends to be dry. Had it twice and both times the burger was dry. The second time, it was also over salted. Fish was flaky but the salt overpowered the taste. Again, they are well-priced. So... you decide."
Hambaobao,4.3,10,Burgers,2,5-Oct-17,"I ordered crispy pork burger. Skin at top layer very crispy indeed, meat a bit tough-5slices in all. Don bother about the fries, some can be so salty and some so bland but all soggy. Nothing fantastic.  I think it was grossly overrated. I won't go patronize them even if I were to visit that hawker center again. There are just so many options."
Heart of Darkness Singapore,5,5,"Bars, Tapas/Small Plates, Gastropubs",5,18-May-24,"What a treat when you are looking for a good ipa.  The lady working was so great.  The beer was nice and cold on a hot, humid Singapore day.  Would recommend you visit for a good beer.  They have food, but we didn't have any."
Heart of Darkness Singapore,5,5,"Bars, Tapas/Small Plates, Gastropubs",5,3-May-19,"I've been known to rant copiously about craft beer, especially when I see it being treated roughly, indifferently, or just improperly. It's a visceral reaction, it upsets me and sits in my craw, an insoluble caustic precipitate slowly eating away at my very core. Conversely, when I see time, energy, and money being poured into an enterprise built around highlighting their most prized product, I weep, especially when the product happens to be proudly, independently crafted beer.  Heart of Darkness (HoD)has not been around a long time, but the depth of flavor and the balance in all their beers belies a wealth of experience extending far beyond the founding of the craft brewery in Saigon, Vietnam. I've been recommending people visit HoD when in Saigon for as long as I can remember and now there's one right in my own backyard! Life just very very much better for anybody who enjoys a flavorful pint. I'm not knocking national or commercial lagers, but if you're counting calories like me, then you might consider giving beers that are brewed independently and with quality ingredients to underscore the highlights of each beer style's characteristic traits a go to make those calories count!  If you know Tras Street, then you'll know that it's converted shophouses that now house bars, restaurants, karaoke bars, coffee joints, and speakeasies. While HoD Singapore is not a speakeasy, you need to pay attention of you might just miss out on a good time. The set up is a taproom and an open kitchen. Thirty taps serve 25 HoD beers and 5 guest taps that will likely be representing local craft breweries, so right off the bat, HoD Singapore is a good ""high density"" beer location to be visiting, especially if you're not in Singapore for long. The partner at HoD Singapore, also has an active interest in craft brewing in Singapore and the likes of That Singapore Beer Project and Daryl's Urban Ales are likely to be regular taps at HoD! The space is cozy, and has a pleasantly edgy vibe. I like it here already, and am thankful to be alive in Singapore at this very moment when craft beer is exploding in the hands of professionals who care about the product enough to want you to care too and enjoy a quality product the way it was created to rock your world!"
Heart of Darkness Singapore,5,5,"Bars, Tapas/Small Plates, Gastropubs",5,8-Jul-19,"This spot was a great find on my walk home one evening. I had gone the wrong direction and ended up on a different street than my usual route and noticed all the taps lined up - more than I've seen at any other spot in SG.  The interior is cozy and inviting, brick all around with an open kitchen in the middle. I can't remember the exact number of beers they had on tap but between their own brews and guest taps, I'd say well over 20. I got a taster (flight of 4) and they were all great. The hazy IPA was actually hazy unlike many of the ""New England style"" IPAs I've had in Singapore that we're still pretty clear all the way through. I'd definitely come back again to try the rest"
Heart of Darkness Singapore,5,5,"Bars, Tapas/Small Plates, Gastropubs",5,12-Nov-19,"This place is super chill, the beer is good, and the staff are genuinely friendly (lots of places here they are just sort of 'polite' which ain't the same thing). Cool 'hood. Highly recommend."
Heart of Darkness Singapore,5,5,"Bars, Tapas/Small Plates, Gastropubs",5,22-Aug-19,"Best place I found for beer hands down! The IPA selection was AMAZING! Nice atmosphere, well done. Make SURE you make it to this palce if you like beer. I wish I could get Heart of Darkness in the US."
Saigon Baguette,5,1,Vietnamese,5,7-Jun-15,"Vietnamese food is authentic. Pho here is better than that of Nam Nam, it seems that they use the fresh noodle, making it taste better while NamNam uses mostly dried instant noodle. Banh mi is also a good option."
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",5,10-Dec-23,"The specialty of J.B. Ah Meng is White Pepper Crab, a whole fresh crab cooked with greens in a spicy white pepper sauce. The pieces of crab were cracked so the flavor seeped through, making for a delicious (and messy) eating experience. Their other signature dishes included the J.B. San Lou Meehoon, a pan-fried ""cake"" of rice noodles cooked with eggs, chicken, and shrimp; and the Lala, or Fried Garlic Chili Clams, a generous portion of clams in a spicy and savory sauce. We also had a soup with golden mushrooms, beancurd sheets, glass noodles, and shell-on prawns; stir-fried vegetables with bean sprouts; and deep-fried green beans with crunchy ""cereal"" and dried shrimp, which had a savory, umami flavor. But my favorite dish was the Deep-Fried Orange Roughy, a scored whole fish deep-fried and topped with dry squid sticks, ginger, and soy sauce. The fish had a delicious meaty flavor, tender interior, and crunchy exterior, making for a delicious combination of flavors and textures. Though the setting with plastic chairs doesn't look like much, the food was delicious, and it was obvious this place was popular with locals!"
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",5,19-Jan-23,"I am on board at the airport leaving Singapore and am craving for the noodle (pictured). I regret not to get it with me on the plane! The noodle is that good!  We ordered crabs, noodle, green vegetable, clam. All good but I really loved the noodle and clam which are just so good.  My friend, yelp elite squad, Nik reserved the crab or it will be gone according to him."
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",5,20-Dec-22,"Great white pepper crab. Fried rice noodle (beejon, served flat like a pancake). Fried chicken wings. Very busy place, helps to have a reservation. Will take credit cards. Kind owner. He got us a Grub ride using his own mobile phone using his owner account (we paid him back in cash). He showed to the corner where the shared ride was coming."
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",5,2-Dec-23,"Very tasty white pepper crab, it doesn't looks good but it is delicious, the third floor noodles looks creepy but taste good, very reasonable prices but good food, highl"
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",4,6-Jul-19,"Reserve a table. Reserve the number of mud crabs while you're at it. Arrive within 10 minutes of your reservation or lose the table.  Brace yourself for the onslaught of noise in the dining room. The servers are patient as you think through your order.  The white pepper mud crabs are a sophisticated twist of a Singapore favorite. The white pepper is more floral and less fiery. And the sauce they coat on the crabs is delectable.  And, you have to get the wok hei beehoon (rice stick noodles) that comes in mats. The texture and flavor are really unique, and an ideal complement to the white pepper crab.  The pork chop is crisp and fragrant.  The salt egg prawn really rich.  I was confused with the ice plant in thousand Island dressing. Not a bad tasting dish. Just not a good companion taste to all the other items on the table.  The ice jelly is served with lime lemonade. Refreshing."
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",4,10-Jan-20,"I've been wanting to eat here for the longest time, so when my boss asked me to organize a team dinner recently, I jumped at the opportunity to do so.  We reached the restaurant at 630pm without any reservation and lucky us, we were seated immediately. To be honest, the staff were pretty intimidating and rude. They work on a no-nonsense basis often ignoring us whenever we try to be friendly conversing with them. When asked what's good and highly recommended, they shove us with a photo album with all their signature dishes and ask us to make a decision. We ordered a few dishes EXCEPT the ""famous"" white pepper crab knowing we'll get ""slaughtered"" alive (overprice). The waitress was giving us an attitude while trying very hard to convince us to order. In the end, we won the battle.  The restaurant is also very noisy - a typical tze-char restaurant where everyone talks at their highest pitch all at the same time. It's like you're eating in a warzone.  Now that I've got all the negatives out, let's talk about the positive. The food was downright delicious. We ordered:  * San Lou mee hoon * Salted egg prawns * Garlic chili clams * Fried pork belly * Stir fry veggies with lotus roots * Stir fry bitter gourd with fish head  Each dish was spot on in terms of flavor and execution. Even my boss, who is a fussy eater rave about the food. The signature mee hoon has a char layer and packed with so much ""wok hei"". That shows the skill of an experienced chef. The salted egg prawns are delicious with bits and pieces of corn thrown in. I won't reveal much of the other dishes, you have to come and try it yourself.  The biggest surprise was when we asked for the bill. The total came up to a total of SG$90+. That's pretty cheap considering we ordered 6 dishes to feed the 5 of us. It's no wonder the restaurant is pack to the brim by 730pm and hoards of people were queuing outside as we leave the restaurant.  Given the rude service and how noisy it is, I would come back in a heartbeat. Good food triumphs, always. And it's no wonder even Michelin star chefs secretly make their way here!"
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",5,9-May-19,"Thanks to Yelper Nik T. for introducing us to JB Ah Meng. Food and service was yummy! Tip: order the white pepper crab ahead of time and book a table. When we got there, all tables were filled already and a line already forming. Dress casual and get ready to get a little messy if you plan to eat crab and clams. It is also noisy like a typical Chinese restaurant (tse cha).  Thanks to Nik, we had a reservation. Most of the servers prefer speaking Chinese so it helps having someone who can speak Chinese. Their menus have good pictures do you could always point.  Nik helped my Dad and I with food recommendations. Like most Chinese meals, it was served family style. We ordered White Pepper Crab, fried Mee Suah Noodles, Fermented Pork Chops, Stir Fried Chives and stir-fried La La Clams with garlic.  Pepper Crab was juicy, succulent and not too spicy unlike the Black Pepper Crab. They gave us a female crab full of delicious roe and cholesterol. The fried noodles ""Mee Suah"" was flavorful and had a nice wok hei (char). The fermented pork chop was one of my favorite dishes. It was marinated in tau chiong (fermented bean paste), bread and deep fried. The chives and bean sprouts were fine, but unremarkable. The clams were terrific! I enjoyed sucking on the shells to get the last bits.  Next time we come back, I would like to tried a salted egg dish. They are also known for that. Thank you, Black Gold Nik T. for leading us to this fantastic food experience!"
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",5,25-Mar-18,"What makes an amazing dinner the perfect meal?  When the company is better than the food!  A BIG thank you to Nik T and Van Z for your warmest Singaporean hospitality. Thank you for everything! Although we didn't get to watch the sunset as planned, the innocent-looking drink that put me to sleep more than made up for the sunset ^_^  A shout-out to Alvin C - it was a great pleasure meeting you!  Now to JB Ah Meng.  The moment you walk in, you can't help but notice the huge posters on the walls highlighting the visit by World renowned Michelin 3-starred chef , Ferran Adria. Other well-known celebrities who have dined there include Gordon Ramsay and Anthony Bourdain.  But alas! This restaurant had no opulent furniture, no crystal chandelier, and no servers in black tuxedos to welcome some of the World's most famous chefs!  JB Ah Meng, until about a year and a half ago, was a hawker-stand style eatery with crowded outdoor tables located in a dark and narrow alley. They have now moved into an air-conditioned cafe-style restaurant space which is a lot more comfortable (at least for me, but some would say the food tasted better or the atmosphere was more authentic in the old alley location.)  WHITE PEPPER CRAB: Crab is almost like the signature cuisine of Singapore and the three most popular culinary versions are: Chili, black pepper, and white pepper. JB Ah Meng specializes in (and is famous for) the white pepper rendition and it was finger-licking good. The white pepper flavor was rich and exotic but not overwhelming. The crab meat tasted fresh and was flavorful.  TIP: When you make your table reservation, you need to reserve your crabs at the same time. Otherwise, you might be disappointed. (Thanks, Nik!)  SALTED EGG PRAWN BALL: If you like Chinese salted egg, then this dish will almost be heavenly for you! Fresh prawns and corn were dipped in a salted egg batter and deep fried to perfection. The rich salted egg yolk flavors added a bold dimension to natural taste of the fresh shrimps and turned this rather simple-looking dish into a most memorable yummy experience.  FRIED GARLIC CHILI LALA: Lala are Southeast Asia clams. Compared to the Pacific clams that we have here on the West Coast (and especially the Pacific Northwest), the lala were smaller, less meaty, but were packed with robust flavors and a distinct seafood ""sweetness"" that is rare outside of Asia. They were fried with an abundance of red hot chili peppers which stimulated the palate and made the lalas super delicious.  STEAMED PEARL GROUPER TAIL: This was a giant fish and we ordered the tail portion which was already plenty of fish for us. It was steamed Hong Kong style and was served with the most delicious soy sauced based juice which retained all the flavors and essence of the fish.  JB SAN LOU MEE HOON: This might look like the least appetizing dish of the night, but let me assure you that if you are fortunate enough to grab a reservation at JB Ah Meng, then this dish is a must-order. Mee hoon in American English is rice vermicelli, which you can easily find in most authentic Asian restaurants in Irvine or the SGV. But I guarantee you that I've never had fried rice vermicelli this good outside of Asia. The most memorable part of this dish was the ""fragrance of the wok"" (or wok hei) that was so rich that the entire table was filled with a sweet aroma the moment this dish was served."
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",5,24-Feb-19,"J.B Ah Meng Restaurant really is such an unsuspecting restaurant. Doesn't look that special or grand, but sit here for 30 minutes and you'll witness 5 cabs coming here to drop off locals. We got the white pepper crab, the chili clams, and the San Lou Bee Hoon.  The bee hoon was very nice (we got the medium size for two people). Has this simple savory flavor. Great dish to start getting you on your way to being full in the meal (so you don't have to break the bank on all the seafood items).  The clams, omg wow. I normally don't like clams that much and I'm so glad we got the medium size vs the small size. You get so much more value, and we struggled to finish it because of the generous portion (or it's just not a 2 person portion lol). Everything about it was perfect. I got to the point, even when there were empty shells, I picked it up with my chopsticks, put it in my mouth, and sucked all the sauce and juices because it was that dam good. I only stopped because my mouth was burning since it gets a bit spicy. For a person that doesn't like clams to do that, I don't think I need to say anymore.  The crab also was amazing. The pepper slowly builds up and combined with the spice from the clams, I was constantly reaching back for the bee hoon to drown out the spice. Still didn't match the first crab we had at Sin Huat Seafood, but was better than the New Ubin Seafood one. So #2 out of three really good crabs. I thought the price was extremely fair given the quality of the food and left feeling really full and happy about this place."
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",4,13-Jan-20,"On my last day in Singapore, I went on a mission to find the white pepper crab that Anthony Bourdain wanted to bring to New York. We arrived a bit early and walked around, but once they saw me queue up, they sat us down immediately.  We ordered:  - White pepper crab (7/10) - we ordered one crab. It's definitely worth trying at least once. The white pepper sauce is interesting, but it made me nervous that I couldn't figure out what was in it, maybe some sort of butter or fat. There was something in the sauce that threw me off. - Green beans w/lotus root (9/10) - love the flavors and textures of this dish, the lightly sweet oyster sauce (or something like it), and the crunch of the fried lotus. We ordered a small. - San lou bee hoon (10/10) - wok-fried noodles with seafood, meat, and some other things. This was the standout dish of the entire meal, even though we came for the crab. We ordered a medium and was able to finish it between the two of us. You must order this dish if you come here. - Salty egg shrimp (5/10) - we made the mistake of getting the medium. It's too much food. this was the only dish we didn't like and didn't finish. it's expensive too! Get a small, if you're in a group of two.  Pro tip: Come early to avoid the crowds. 5:30 is a good time to come. Otherwise, I recommend having your hotel make a reservation for you. I attempted to make my own reservation, but the person who picked up the phone did not speak English, so I had the concierge at my hotel call to make a resie."
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",5,12-Feb-19,"I have been pushing my meal times later and later to dodge the heat, so it's great that this place stays open until 2 or so. However, I think they start running out of crabs around 11 or so.  Got the chance to try the white pepper crab and other dishes after coming back a few times. Definitely come early if you want the white pepper crab, because it's worth the effort and the price tag. Would suggest getting at least the medium or larger sized for more meaty bites.  Honestly, all the other dishes were pretty good as well, but I just wasn't so big at the salted egg prawn. Thought it was just missing something... The San Lou Mee was a solid hit. Small portion is probably good enough for 2 regular people (or 1 of me).  You can also see the boss man walking around from time to time. He's pretty easy to recognize because his face is all over the wall..."
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",3,25-Jan-19,"Came here super late after a long night of drinking and general mayhem. Definitely missed the dinner hours and the waitress was super thrilled that I actually found the only chair that they haven't yet put away. (Not really~)  ""No more crab!!!"", she declared.  I'm assuming that all the crabs have already gone home from the restaurant after a long day of work, long before the waitress was allowed to leave herself.  ""Fine..."" The outlook of trying to pick apart a crab in that state of inebriation was probably not an ideal scenario.  So I ordered some fish and veggie dishes, and they all arrived around the time that I noticed the picture of Melissa McCarthy from her visit up on the wall. Nice.  The steamed grouper was good, though a bit over steamed. Sauce wasn't too sweet or anything. Inhaled the whole thing in a few minutes.  Wouldn't necessarily recommend the pork rib w/ bitter gourd. Not that it was too bitter, but there wasn't really a substantial amount of pork ribs inside.  Tummy full. Mission accomplished.  Grumpy waitress lady, I will see you again soon. It's a date."
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",5,8-Aug-21,"Decided to review this store which I did take away 1 week ago.  The food is 5/5. They use very strong flavours and each and every dish is robustly flavoured. However tip is get a few people to share, could get a bit ""scared"" if you eat too much of the same dish.  Try the burnt bee Hoon. Extremely delicious and though this dish is sold in many place, no other places I've. Even to come close to this this. Also try the sea asparagus with smoked duck. It's nice, really nice.  Even the head chef of elbulli went to dine here, I saw the pictures there. Enjoy !"
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",5,15-Sep-21,"I'm reviewing this place so that I don't ever lose it. This was hands down one of my favorite meals in Singapore. Their white pepper crabs, lala clams, salted egg prawns, meehoon, all those veggie dishes. Everything!!!! Everything was cooked to perfection. Don't forget to ask for their chilis and hot sauces!"
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",4,14-Feb-19,"My friend made reservations at JB Ah Meng so I could try the famous white pepper crab when I visited Singapore. The crab was delicious; HOWEVER, it was extremely spicy! I had to down two coconuts while eating the crab. Make sure you don't have any cuts on your hands or fingers otherwise they will burn (speaking from experience...). Aside from the crab, all of the other side dishes we ordered were equally as good. I loved the clams as well as the fried lotus root/green bean dish.  This place was much more crowded than I was expecting. According to my friend, a reservation is a must if you want to dine here so plan ahead of time! If I am ever in Singapore again in the future, I will for sure be paying a visit to JB Ah Meng."
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",5,28-Sep-17,"The white pepper crab was the best thing I ate the entire time I was in Singapore, and I managed to pack in A LOT of meals in just 10 days. I also tried the garlic chili clams, fried beehoon, snake beans with lotus root, and salted egg prawn balls - all so yummy! I wish I could cook like this but sadly I will have to travel 9500 miles to eat this again. So sad..."
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",5,8-Apr-22,"Had their famous noodles and white pepper crabs, all to die for, would definitely visit SG again just to have their noodles and crabs."
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",5,17-Jul-19,"Wow we were there before 5:30pm they were nice enough to offer a table to wait for the opening. And at 5:30pm the race starts!!!!!! People just poured like the water. The ordering grandma was super hyper and helped us along the way to order and insisted that we order medium for the noodle. Got to say she has Jedi power in mind control am sure we will be left broke later - eat first die later:). All in all we ordered 6 dishes so lets see how good they are. And...... we are without words!!! All 6 dishes displayed sofistication in execution. For example, veg comes put with wokhei, crisp and with vibrant color. For us the pork was the star!! Though deep fried it is not oily at all and it is addictive!! This place earns the ""I'll be Bak!!"
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",4,12-Aug-19,"This place is very reasonably price. We had 6 dishes and they all tested very decent. During peak hours 6 - 8, expect a long line. Come after 8 and the crowd start thinning down. All their seafood dishes are excellent."
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",4,25-Nov-18,"Good food but service is so so. We are one of the first group to enter the restaurant but it took a while for them to take our orders. There is long interval between the dishes and we have to keep asking the waitress where is our food; between the first and last dish, we waited for about 45 minutes. Will be back again but probably not during the weekends. Recommended to make a reservation, and note that they hold the reservation for 5 minutes only; good to be there early. The white pepper crabs is still the best in town!"
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",5,31-Dec-19,"Very tasty white pepper crab, it doesn't looks good but it is delicious, the third floor noodles looks creepy but taste good, very reasonable prices but good food, highly recommended"
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",3,20-Aug-17,"Great place if you're a heartlander, GOOD food, questionable waiters/waitresses and a rather backward atmosphere.  All for heartland eating but definitely did not enjoy the waitress constantly brushing me aside to write an order down on the table. Definitely could do better but do not expect too much in terms of service. Maybe it was I who did not voice out my displeasure with being brushed against with a wet arm. Great food and great price though!"
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",4,12-Sep-15,"Very legit seafood place if you are ok with the atmosphere (eating in an alley), I ordered:  1) white pepper crab - must get, very flavorful but you will have to get your hands dirty.  2) garlic clams - so good! Get this and be happy  3) salted egg prawn with corn - I have never tasted anything like this, I would order this for a try and the corn is addicting.  4) fish skin with pickled veggies - not my fave nth people like it  5) fried eggplant and potatoes - really enjoyed this with the sauce and combo of potatoes and eggplant"
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",5,9-Jul-12,"The best kind of alleys to eat in are in Geylang: you never know what will happen.  It's a little ramshackle, gritty and dirty -- which is why I love it so. It's real! And Geylang is awesome.  Their signature dishes are the 'san lou bee hoon' (which isn't in any way like 'san lou hor fun' btw -- different 'lou'). Also known as ""three storeys bee hoon"". It's not like any beehoon you've ever had. It's fried, with all the lovely 'wok hei' bits, and it's flat. Flattened like a pancake. I don't know why. But it's great.  The salted egg prawn balls are gorgeous too, with little bits of corn in the batter. The fried fish skin. OMG. And the white pepper crabs!"
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",3,17-May-14,"The Singapore fried noodles were amazing. The white pepper crab was solid, but not work getting your hands ad dirty as it demanded. The sweet pork thing was really good."
JB Ah Meng,4.6,25,"Chinese, Seafood",5,30-Jul-15,I found it very interesting to eat in an alley. And JB Ah Meng serves up seriously amazing san luo mee hoon and salted egg prawns! Highly recommended!
Chabuton,4.8,6,Ramen,5,9-May-19,"Very good ramen, actually one of the best ramen was here in Singapore.  I was in the area, unsure of what I wanted to eat, I came in without reading reviews or anything, just walked in as price seemed reasonable.  They weren't that busy and I wasn't expecting much from this small restaurant. To my surprise, the broth had very rich taste and noodle was perfect. They have a half size available if you are not that hungry.  If you love ramen like I do, must try here while in Singapore."
Chabuton,4.8,6,Ramen,5,18-Jul-19,"Another round of ramen lunch.. yeah I had a lot of ramen just this month..  Chabuton (the chain) was once supervised by a Michelin-starred chef but since he does not owned the chain or cook here, I do not think that has any influence to how I review or think of this restaurant. Nevertheless, the restaurant does not need that to promote the establishment.  FOOD 5/5 The restaurant offers weekday set lunch which was highly affordable. For $14.50, I received a Tonkotsu Ramen, a side (I chose the potato korroke), dessert (choice of ice cream of the day or two pieces of jello) and a drink (hot or cold green tea).  The ramen had a big piece of char siu (pork) and it was so tender and tasty. The broth was savory and the noodles was cooked to perfection. The ramen was definitely the star and I highly recommend it.   SERVICE 5/5 Staffs taking order and at the check out were both nice. Not on the same level with those staffs at Ritz-Carlton or Conrad, but they were great and I was happy.   AMBIENCE 5/5 It was not too big a place but the staff let me and girlfriend occupied the booth/bench seating so you know it, I love it!! D¨¦cor was simple and easy on the eyes.  So yes, Chabuton just joined the ramen places I would recommend and go in Singapore :)  07.16.2019"
Chabuton,4.8,6,Ramen,5,16-Oct-16,"It is been just moments after I've quaffed the dregs of warm luscious broth of my Karakara Tonkatsu Ramen and nibbled on the sordid bits of fried shallot, leek, spicy pork...  And delicious moments are wafting across my mind as delectable afterglow memories. Bites of firm ramen. Gently chewing the braised belly pork. Slurping up the softboiled egg drizzled with the braising liquid from the square of pork belly.  Every element I obsesses over regarding good ramen was represented at exemplary levels. Lip gummIng pork bone broth laden with creamy cloudy collagen but skimmed until it was pristine. Noodles with the requisite al dente bite. Savory spicy ground pork. Bright herbal leek crunch. Earthy fried shallots and sesame seeds.  Perfection is elusive, but I agree with the Michelin star award of this simple, OCD satiating ramen shrine."
Chabuton,4.8,6,Ramen,5,27-Jan-19,"Absolutely delicious! I was in Singapore for a week and I went here twice. This is huge given that Singapore already has so many food options. The first time I went, I ordered the spiciest thing on the menu (I don't remember what it's called, but it starts with a Y). And it was one of the best ramens I've ever tried! The next time I go to Singapore, I am definitely coming back here!"
Chabuton,4.8,6,Ramen,4,4-Apr-16,"There are several ramen shops around M.Walk but chabuton is always my favourite during lunch time. Its portion is just enough: soup is tasty, meat is juicy. The chef owner is 1* Michelin star."
Chabuton,4.8,6,Ramen,5,30-May-17,"I'm currently working in the area, and this is my go to place for a $10 donburi. Good quality food, good price. It does get crowded, of course..."
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",4,23-Nov-17,"Popped in here with a friend for thanksgiving! Service is in a bar slash Resturant. The noise level can get high at times. The service is normal and friendly. The drink menu is quite large for those finicky drinkers.  Tried the tenderloin steak cubes as an appetizer. The steak was tender and juicy. But the kicker for awesome plate was the blue cheese sauce for the cubes. I ordered a misc salad plate with roast beef, cheese and greens, with a serving of fresh soft bread. Again a great mix good ingredients, and fresh veggies. For the main course I ordered the Connemara chicken. This came with fresh mash potatoes and cucumber and green beans.  The drinks are a bit pricey is the only downside.  Overall the meal was comfortable and very satisfying!! I look to coming here again for the tenderloin cubes."
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",5,20-Dec-23,The best Irish expat pub in the whole city state. Hopefully Don is working and you'll get his witty charm. The service is always an 11! Live music and rugby games make the atmosphere come alive!!
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",3,20-Jan-23,If you like to have conversations avoid the live music night. Otherwise it's a decent popular hang out. Sometimes the place is packed other times it's dead. It's dark and gritty. Pretty good pour on the cocktails but no quality craft beers. Next door to the infamous orchard towers.
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",4,24-Jul-18,Really great service in a good location! The lack of a 5 Star review was due to the seating situation (which probably can't be changed much now) being very uncomfortable; wooden benches too small for the American butt. The wings had a great flavor and everything was reasonably priced. I felt like I was back in Dublin.
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",5,20-Oct-17,"Hit Muddy Murphy's on a Friday night for dinner and a pint. Saw a special, Kilkenny pint + mini-fish and chips for $25...SOLD. The mini-order was more than I could finish and tasted great. I would repeat for the fish and chips anyday. Another positive...staff talked me into another pint about 10 minutes before happy hour ended which was a nice gesture as they told me I'd save $2 off the pint. Nice atmosphere, great Irish pub in Singapore!"
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",3,19-Sep-17,"Hidden GEM off Orchard Avenue near the Hilton Singapore. They have EXCELLENT Live Music. We were there for a classic rock band, and they were FANTASTIC! Clapton to CCR, they were GREAT! The atmosphere is FUN, but it is LOUD inside. The drawback outside is the cigar smoke, and the service is slower because they do not staff the outside to meet the crowd.  We did not try the food, although the food selection seemed to be typical English/Irish fare. The beer selection is SOLID. I enjoyed a Guiness, and it was GOOD. I have had better Guiness at other Irish Pubs around the world where they take GREAT care and pride to make sure the beer is stored and served properly making the ""Guiness Experience"" delicious and cold. NOT AT ALL impressed with the Black and Tan pour that my friend had... NO separation AT ALL. They obviously do not know how to pour the PROPER Black and Tan.  Overall, I rate it as FUN (because of the EXCELLENT live music) and GOOD. This is a SWING BY if NEARBY."
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",4,6-Sep-16,"Casual bar / dining atmosphere. They have Happy Hours (note the plural) from 11am -7.30pm daily, with a good range of draft beers / cider on tap and house wines on offer. Just be careful when starting a tab as they may overcalculate your drinks once Happy Hours ends. Had a group buy us 2 rounds of drinks after HHs ended, and were charged for drinks we didn't buy.. Easier to pay at each round than argue with the waitresses at then end of the night!  Food and drinks are a reasonable priced for Singapore - though HHs on draught drinks are only about $2SGD cheaper than during non-HHs..  Staff are nice and friendly and super helpful. If you want free wifi, just ask for the wifi password"
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",3,18-Mar-16,"How does this place get 4 stars?  Anyway, it's an Irish pub.  And a can of coke is $7 - sorry, I should say ""seven focking dollars!!!!""  That's right. $7 for a can of coke.  Did I mention that a can of coke was $7?  Food is acceptable (barely), and they have a decent lunchtime meal of $9 nett or $12 nett with a drink.  Service is friendly and they try their best.  But SERIOUSLY?? $7 for a can of coke???"
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",4,17-Sep-16,Really a nice place to chill and hang. Beer is good. Atmosphere nice and relax. Bar food ain't bad either. No frills ;)
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",5,15-Apr-15,"This Irish pub is in the back of the building if you enter from Penang Rd. Very friendly and attentive people work here! The lady serving beer gladly had conversation with me drinking guinness alone at the bar counter. Perfect air conditioning. My stomach didn't have space to try their food, but they looked good!! Their free wifi worked perfect too. Will definitely return when I visit Singapore again."
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",5,23-Oct-12,"This place has not changed in a decade - and why should it? Consistently a great place to hang out for a late Sunday lunch, a welcoming bar staff and comfortable chairs and tables to relax. Firstly, the beers are not at extortionate prices - Guinness and Kilkenny @ $12/ pint, Archipelago Red Ale @ $11.50. These prices include GST - something I wished bars and restaurants were forced to include in their menu prices.  My friend ordered the 2 course Sunday roast ($20) which included roast beef, mashed potatoes, some other vegetables, Yorkshire pudding and gravy. I had a slice of the beef, and it was fantastic. I ordered the fish and chips ($16) and as others have said here - it is fantastic, the fish is fresh and the chips taste like they are homemade.  Overall, if you want to while away a lazy Sunday afternoon, stop here for a bit and recharge your batteries. The prices are very reasonable, the food is excellent and it is just a nice place to hang out."
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",5,1-Dec-13,Went back to the new Muddy's after it was relocated from the back of the Orchard hotel to triple 1 Somerset.  Same great staff. Same great service. Same great drink choice. Same great food. Given that it is no longer in a basement it is much brighter than before.  Staff were working very hard to get some of the bugs ironed out caused by the quick move but they have the same good humored attention to service and detail that they always had.  Blows the doors of the poor level of service at the Penny Black.
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",4,27-Feb-18,"Lively band, good food and drink. Good place to hang out especially if you are a smoker. Nice outdoor area you can watch sports and have a smoke. Guinness and Speckled are winners, menu is good and hearty but could use an update. Great place to watch the game but get there early if you want to sit."
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",3,21-Dec-12,"Guess this is as typical as you can get for a pub.  Non-pretentious, never really busy till you can't get a seat (except maybe at st Patrick's)"
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",5,25-Sep-18,"One of the best bars in Singapore. You can get an excellent Guinness or Kilkenny pour, with all the best live sporting events. Orchard Towers mythical 4 floors is right across the street, too!"
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",4,11-Jun-18,Typical Irish pub. Great fish and chips. Cold beer with televisions all over. Perfect for a cold one on a humid Singapore afternoon.
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",3,18-Mar-18,"Pretty cool atmosphere with live music. It does get very loud inside the pub! Had a few Guinness pints and they all seemed off, not sure what the flavor really was but it was off and had a very different taste to it."
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",3,27-Jan-15,Great place to chill after work and or for a Sunday mid day beer.. But theres really nothing spectacular about the food nor drinks.. So if I wasn't staying close by.. It would not be a place I'd suggest to go.
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",2,11-Mar-18,Absolutely shocking. One of the busiest days for sport in the year and woefully short on staff. Those that were on duty did their best but the management has to get their act together. A 45 minute wait to get your bill is totally unacceptable!
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",3,29-Jun-14,"In Singapore for a conference and have been eating rich, expensive meals, so I decided I wanted a beer and burger. Muddy Murphy's was within reasonable walking distance of my hotel, and it had pretty good reviews, so I decided to try it. I ordered a Guinness and a beef burger. Service was a little slow, but competent. The beer was cold and about what expected. The burger was ok - had a bit of gristle - the French fries were good and an adequate amount. Overall it was a good experience and I'd go back. (PS. It was a Sunday PM so they had a ""live"" group playing rock & roll - a plus?)"
Muddy Murphy's,3.9,21,"Pubs, Irish",5,6-Mar-14,"Great location. It has several rooms so if you want to hear the music, sit outside or just find somewhere quiet there's something for you.  It was also perfect for our large group (20+ people). The staff was superb and kept us our drinks full the whole night. They went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed ourselves.  Drinks prices are what you would expect, with happy hour taking of a couple of dollars per drink. Food was good too with quite a bit of variety.  We will definitely be back, thanks!"
Lao You Xuan Noodle Kitchen,5,1,"Singaporean, Noodles, Soup",5,6-Jun-17,"Lao You Xuan's Seafood Soup is definitely a treat. Imagine a piping hot bowl of savoury and tasty soup with a generous serving of sliced fish, fresh prawns, fish balls, topped with crispy fish skin rolls. It matters not whether you enjoy the soup with a bowl of steamed rice or your choice of noodles (kway tiao, thin bee hoon, thick bee hoon, mee pok, mee kia, mee sua), because this soup is made to indulge. It's comfort food at its best."
The RiceTable,4.3,9,Indonesian,4,1-Nov-17,"We had a lovely farewell dinner here tonight with our Singapore kids. We wanted something different from the everyday rice and/or noodle food we have been eating while here. I remembered having Rijstafel many years ago at the Bali Restaurant in Amsterdam so looked for it here. It was just as good! 20 different dishes - all were good. My favorites were the cucumber pickles, the grilled chicken (I thought it was beef!!!) my son-in-law had at least 4 bowls of soup -- it was wonderful soup. The deep fried dory fish was a table favorite. Have some Tiger beer with your meal. It goes perfectly. Lastly we tried the durian fruit dessert. Kind of a large snowball with coconut milk, durian, tapioca and gelatin bits. Tasted nasty in the front of the mouth but got better as it hit the back. Definitely a destination meal."
The RiceTable,4.3,9,Indonesian,5,21-Oct-12,"Before eating here, I'd heard loads... especially about how much you get to eat. And that's always good news when you talk about a buffet - the whole point is to eat till you (almost) pop, right?  I'd like to say at this point that everything I heard was true.  Oh joy, pure joy; when you get to eat as much as you want, and doubly so when the food is AWESOME!  You walk in, and say ""yes, I'd like to have the buffet, please."" They show you to your seat. And the awesomeness begins.  You sit down, and they place these heating trays in front of you, and you wonder: are they setting up the buffet right in front of you? THE ANSWER IS YES. The army of plates and bowls emerge from the kitchen, onto your table. And you dig into EVERYTHING. Shame that your mouth can only fit that much in at once, because it is all NOM, I mean delicious.  You get all the favourites for lunch - tahu telur, rendang, bbq ayam, some fruit rojak to refresh the palate, and there's even more for dinner. When the dish looks a little empty, turn around and give your server your best puppydog eyes, and it'll get refilled (or don't, they'll probably do it anyway).  Gracia's right, bookings are essential, and even more so when you want to go there with a decent sized gang, if you want to try all the deliciousness they have on offer."
The RiceTable,4.3,9,Indonesian,5,19-Aug-12,"Had to host some Indonesian guests over lunch one day, and with that, we got a table for ten at TRT. I've been hearing all sorts of good things about it ever since its location at Suntec but never got around to trying it out. So, what better time than now?  The venue is on the tiny side, and it was a bit of a squeeze for all of us. We were there for lunch, and I must say that the prices are very fair. For a lunch buffet, it set us back at approximately $17++ per pax, and we were all stuffed to the gills. There are little heated racks placed in the middle of the table, and small platters of appetizers and food start to pile up. The range is extensive - rendang, satay, ikan goreng, tahu telor, sambal udang, sayur lodeh and so on. The dinner menu is a little more extensive, but you need to ensure that your party is big enough, otherwise you'd be too stuffed to eat very much and that would be quite a pity.  Owing to its popularity, TRT is immensely crowded. If you don't have a reservation, I'm sorry, but you'd be better off lunching at TCC downstairs. Service can be a little hard to attract due to too many customers vying for the servers' attention but once you catch their eye, it's all good.  There's roof top parking available, though it means that your steely steed will be left to bake in the mid day sun. Give it some time before you slide back into your car, else you'll burn your bum. TRT used to do bento box deliveries, but not sure if they still continue this today."
The RiceTable,4.3,9,Indonesian,5,18-Feb-17,"Good services and reasonable price, clean restaurant not very crowded like food courts. Don't miss the tender and delicious Rendang Beef (stew) , taufu telor (tofu egg), belachan kangkung, satay chicken, and exotic desert drink: coconut cendol with/without authentic durian. I recommend reserve seat for big pax larger than 4. Kevin the owner is a courteous guy and pleasant person to talk to."
The RiceTable,4.3,9,Indonesian,3,26-Mar-15,"The food at rice table is fantastic but the service borders on rude. I've been to the Rice Table about three times in the last year and always enjoy eating the kick ass, puffy tahu telor that is fried crisp and drizzled with a rich peanut sauce. I like the simple yet tasty soto ayam that starts each meal, and the ayam paggang (that honestly looks more like stewed chicken rather than grilled chicken), tongue tingling sambal kang kong and sweet Indonesian style satay. On the other hand, they do a whole bunch of watery seafood curries that don't show off the ingredients, the otak tastes like it was made in a factory and the bergedil is meh. In general, you can be assured of a good meal at the Rice Table, just beware of the service.  The Rice Table hires some teenagers that probably work to earn some extra pocket money and it shows. On my first visit for a dinner of 15 people, my host called ahead to let the restaurant know we would like to split the bill a certain way (drinks on one tab, food split individually). We knew this would be difficult and hence called ahead to make sure it was ok. Well communication broke down somewhere and each person was charged a drink with their food despite us explaining in person several times.  On my second and third visits just with the dude, we arrived at 9pm and 8.30pm respectively. When we walked in and asked for a table for 2, the waiter on our first visit LITERALLY rolled his eyes at us, looked at the clock and said, ""last order is 9.30pm and you need to get out by 9.45pm sharp"". Oh hello and welcome to you too. We thought ok next time we'll come earlier so we did at 8.30pm and received a very similar, curt response from another waiter. When we sat down, no one came to explain how the menu worked (since the time between our first and second visit was almost a year) and the waiters were merely interested in plonking down the dishes as quickly as possible. That being said, there is a lady who I think is Indonesian and is polite and actually is a joy to speak to but most of the time, I just felt like I had rained on someone's parade. I don't eat at buffet restaurants ever so maybe this is the norm and perhaps their target demographic is a repeat customer that doesn't expect service for the price, but oh well."
The RiceTable,4.3,9,Indonesian,4,27-Sep-15,"Nice deal for lunch, 17.90 all you can eat. The food was awesome and service attentive. Full disclosure, this was my first Indonesian meal. I would go back for the lady fingers, fried fish and all the sauces."
The RiceTable,4.3,9,Indonesian,4,2-Dec-13,"This is our second visit here, the first a year ago. We enjoy this place and their style of serving because you get the best exposure to the wide range of food flavors that exist in Asian foods. Unlike many restaurants where they have one particular specialty, the preparation and flavors of the food here are many and varied. The Rice table is informal and the focus is on food not d¨¦cor. There's no thinking involved, just show up and they give you a bit of everything. How civilized. Visitors in the Orchard area should give this a visit for an intro to Indonesian cuisine. As a bonus, there's a foot massage place downstairs from the restaurant. Now that's civilized!"
The RiceTable,4.3,9,Indonesian,4,15-Nov-16,"so far my favorite eating experience in singapore. been here only 2 full days though so there might be more to come but seems like this is a pretty expensive city and this place was like $17.90 including tax and service and was all you can eat. i think i liked it b/c it seemed nice and yet authentic and not too hipster and was really delicious. the service was really nice as the hub is allergic to shrimp and so many things have shrimp paste in it but they brought him the fruit salad and tahu telor minus the sauce. the kang kong belachan (ong choy!) and the veggies in coconut stew they couldn't remove the shrimp paste though. overall this was super delicious, really liked that warming tray with candles underneath. i was super full afterwards and didn't end up getting refills on anything. fyi though your hair and clothes may be a little odoriferous afterwards but whatever at least my belly was full of delicious indonesian food. what a nice experience!"
The RiceTable,4.3,9,Indonesian,5,6-Apr-15,"Our lunch at The Rice Table was a special experience - a great way to try small dishes of many different Indonesian flavors. They serve all-you-care-to-eat ""set menus"" of 14 lunch dishes for S$17.90/person and 19 dinner dishes for S$28.50 - a real value for this quality and authentic flavors of food. Our meal included: Javanese Chicken Soup, Vegetables in Coconut Stew, Beef Rendang, Curry Chicken, Ladyfingers (Okra) in Bean Sauce, Curried Tofu, Chicken Satays in Peanut Sauce (we had a second dish of these - the sauce was divine), Kangkong Belachan (stir-fried spinach with chilies and shrimp paste), Otak (spiced fish paste in a banana leaf), Grilled Chicken, Fried Sweet and Sour Fish, Tahu Telor (bean curd omelettes), Pickled Cucumbers, and Indonesian Fruit Salad. The servings are small enough that you can actually eat all of the dishes, and you may request additional servings or deletions of any of the dishes - they just ask that you not waste food. Located at the top of the escalator to the second floor of 360 Orchard Road's International Building (a small building located between the Shaw House and the Royal Thai Embassy - take the Orchard Road MRT stop and walk through the mall following signs to Shaw House), the 54-seat restaurant itself is simply and serenely decorated. Dishes were served on a candle-powered warmer in the middle of our table so foods stay warm and can be eaten at leisure. Service was attentive but not obtrusive. A lovely dining experience that we would highly recommend, especially for foodies who want to savor a wide-range of Indonesian specialties."
Fat Chap,4,1,"Asian Fusion, Tapas/Small Plates",4,18-Oct-19,"This is more a drinking place with food, rather than a proper dining restaurant: lots of drink options, casual (and very friendly) service and d¨¦cor, where passers-by strolling on the pavement can see what you consume, etc. But don't underestimate the food - it's much more than bar food. Lots of yummy, innovative dishes. So delish that if you're not careful, you can easily put on more than 1,500 calories by the end of the meal."
Joo Bar,4.1,10,Korean,5,25-Oct-23,"Work trip, day 5, Korean sounded really good. This place did not disappoint. I ordered the Flaming Chick Jumeokbap and of all things a Guinness. It worked. Didn't try the rice wine but next time.  Be patient, food worth the wait!"
Joo Bar,4.1,10,Korean,2,9-Apr-19,"Was super excited to checked this place out but the was disappointed in the end. The truffle fries were decent, but the pork belly plate didn't do it for me at all. The pork was good, but the kimchi was way way way too sweet. It was almost like eating candied pork...  I saw the party next to me munching on some wings and was kind of wishing that I ordered that instead... Since the food was just so so, it really kept me from ordering the makgeolli here.  The atmosphere and interior setup was ok, though the overall size of the place was on the small side. Unfortunately, this was a one and done for me."
Joo Bar,4.1,10,Korean,3,20-Sep-18,"I've been here twice, mainly for their yummy frozen makgeolli drinks. The food here is alright, but probably not my first pick for Korean food. There are many other Korean restaurants I would prefer although it's kind of hard to beat a location like this, with the right combination of finger foods and great drinks.  They have more than a dozen (if my memory serves) types of makgeolli in all kinds of flavors - from passionfruit to strawberry. There's a sampler but you can also get them in jugs to share. One evening, we popped by before closing and managed to get a table in the packed restaurant. We were led to a table upstairs where it was much more quiet and thus great for having a chat over drinks. They had every flavor available so we chose yuzu and passionfruit.  I would definitely recommend the passionfruit - it was sweet and sour, and full of fresh delicious flavor, and you could see all the little seeds in there so you know it's made with fresh passionfruit. The yuzu was a little on the subtle side, I think I'm used to that delicious fragrant kick you get from yuzu tea so I had high hopes that were slightly deflated. It was super refreshing regardless and a good crowd-pleaser.  I took away one star for slow service and relatively boring food options. Quite nice for drinks though!"
Joo Bar,4.1,10,Korean,5,6-Mar-15,"i want nobody, nobody but joo! i want nobody, nobody but joo! nan dareun sarameun sirheo niga animyeon sirheo! i want nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody!  joo marries two of my favourite things from korea. makgeolli(fermented rice alcoholic beverage) and budae jjigae(army stew)!!!  there is no shortage of korean restaurants in SG. tanjong pagar and chinatown are full of them. but joo has that little something special. a sexy, charismatic aura that draws me in. there are no rough edges here. everything is smooth and suave. from the decor to the staff.  the food and beverage is thoughtfully created mostly from scratch and you can taste the quality. the simple banchan they served me, was simply polished off. they are not mere fillers but side dishes that whets your appetite and enhances the overall dining experience! from the sweet, spicy and sour radish, to the soft and creamy macaroni egg salad, to the crispy fried tiny fish, you can taste the love that goes into it!  budae jjigae! what can i say! best eaten in the cold harsh winters of korea! a very humble army stew that comprises hot dog, spam and ham mixed with gochujang and kimchi plus instant ramen! they get the ratio just right here! the consistency, heat and spice will light up a winter's night! and it's a single serve portion, unlike many other places where you need to share with 2 or more people.  makgeolli! since my seoul mate introduced me to this drink at a specialty makgeolli bar, i have never looked back. no soju, just makgeolli for me, please! just like i have a fetish for cloudy apple juice and cloudy sancerre, i have to have makgeolli! here it is home brewed, organic, made fresh daily, no aspartame. so expect the original version to be slightly sour instead of sweet. but they do have sweet versions with fruits, if that floats your boat. i would recommend the yucha slush makgeolli. you will hardly notice that you are drinking an alcoholic beverage.  the baby eel paper, thin sheets of small eel pressed and deep fried are mas-issneun! best accompanied with alcohol!  then there's their secret weapon! homemade thin cut crisps, always sliced and fried fresh daily! no overnighters allowed! so if you come late at night before closing and sit at the bar, they will all be yours to eat, for FREE!:)  i want nobody, nobody but joo! i want nobody, nobody but joo! how can i be with another, i don't want any other! i want nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody!"
Joo Bar,4.1,10,Korean,4,2-Oct-15,"This is a quaint little modern Korean place. I popped by with a bibulous friend on a weeknight and had chicken wings, the makgeolli sampler, and regular makgeolli to wash everything down.  Oh my. They have good wings here, and I'm not even a wings kinda gal. Juicy, crispy, with garlic bits on it, you will not regret ordering em here.  I particularly enjoyed the makgeolli sampler, though I cannot for the life of me remember the flavors. If you have a girlfriend or a date, she will most certainly enjoy the sampler; doubles up as a dessert for someone with a sweet tooth!  Did not try dinner items as we came here post-dinner."
Joo Bar,4.1,10,Korean,5,24-Feb-15,"This newly-discovered place by me is my current go-to place to indulge in chill K tunes, drink makgeolli and dine on fusion Korean food that is oh-so-yummy.  Verdict: - Makgeolli Sampler Set - Good to try this on your first visit to get a taste of the different flavoured Makgeolli. If you're a Makgeolli veteran, I suggest that you skip this. The portion is small (of course, it's just a sampler) but looks great for pics. There are 5 in the set - Original, Yuzu, Lychee, Peach and Strawberry and my personal preference is in the order listed.  - Yuzu Makgeolli (large size) - Very refreshing and one of my favourites. The large size is good to share among 2 ladies.  - Braised pork belly - Per serving comes with a few slices. Honestly, this dish had a chef recommended symbol on the menu but the pork slices were quite tough and chewy. Not something I would order again.  - Home-made Tapioca chips - Yums! Goes great with Makgeolli with two dips given.  - Gangnam Dreaming cocktail - Had a 7up initial taste but faded to a bittersweet berry aftertaste.  - Insadong memories - One of the best cocktails I've tasted during my trips to Joo Bar. Refreshing, sweet and had a great cinnamon ginger taste. Double like!  Been here 4 times within the past 2 months and will keep coming back for more mod Korean food!  Tip: Sit near the bar if you're not here for dinner as it is pretty interesting chatting with the bespectacled bartender Eddy, and see how he mix the drinks for you. Also, you tend to get a bucket of FOC chips if you're sitting at the bar compared to ordering drinks at the usual table."
Joo Bar,4.1,10,Korean,5,19-Feb-16,"Was so intrigued by the Makgeoli, had to come back a second time, but this time sans the coworker who only liked beer.  Had the normal Makgeoli small bottle. It has a stronger kick of alcohol than normal. Was very tasty. Didn't try the standard Makgeoli out of their beer tap, the waitress mentioned it wasn't as strong and was lighter.  I've tried the Army Stew, raboki, kimchee Prawn pasta, and bossam. All were good hits to the palate.  Bossam - the pork was on the fatty side, but was nicely braised. The cabbage had a unique lemon flavor. The dikon kimchee had nicely grilled garlic that I enjoyed. Definitely a winner dish.  Army Stew - spicy stew with sausage, noodles, green onions and other yummy ingredients. I'm used to seeing spam as well though it seemed to be missing. Good and tasty dish.  Raboki - a traditional drinking accompaniment (anju). Tubes of rice cake with fishcake tempura in a spicy red sauce is the duk bokki and you add the Ramen noodles to make it a rraboki. Ramen + duk bokki = raboki.  Kimchee Prawn Pasta - really enjoyed the Korean twist to the traditional Prawn pasta dish.  Good Korean bar with tasty anju. Liked the Makgeoli theme and the place is pretty chill. Seems you need reservations to be seated on the 2nd floor."
Joo Bar,4.1,10,Korean,3,25-Jun-16,"You got a tree in your backyard growing money for you and you LOVE (Korean rice wine) as much as I do, this is your place.  I laughed at the idea that they had in draft. But it was yum to the me.  bo ssam was delicious and the use of citron is quite brilliant. Pork belly was delicious.  Three stars for such an arrogant pricing and failing to win me over with portion.  On a side note, where the hell are these young kids making money? Or are they just spending the hard-earned money so foolishly on some creative cocktail using makkuli??"
Joo Bar,4.1,10,Korean,4,14-Feb-15,Very impressed on my first visit here. That dark interior with white washed walls gives Joo Bar a cozy and chill feel. The food would entice any korean food fans. I particularly like the Joo Bossam and the minced beef. Try the set of makegolli of 5 @ $35. Good for a gathering of friends on a weekday night.  full review on my blog.
Joo Bar,4.1,10,Korean,5,4-Sep-15,"We discovered this hidden place passing by. Quite close from Bugis MRT. The deco is very stylish, the menu is very unique has it is a Korean bar with unique food and drink specialities."
SYIP,4,1,"Breakfast & Brunch, Coffee & Tea",4,18-Feb-24,SYIP white coffee was pretty balanced with the lightly sweetened cream. but matcha latte was a tad diluted. and the teeny glasses aren't worth the prices in my opinion.
The BOILER Seafood Bar & Beer,4.1,17,"Seafood, Bars",3,27-Oct-15,"A very messy place to have seafood. A copy of of seafood places you'll see in American costal towns and cities. Good food but a bit pricy. Dinner for 6 adults and 6 kids cost S$491, and we only ordered 2 bags of seafood. And 8 baskets of fries and rings."
The BOILER Seafood Bar & Beer,4.1,17,"Seafood, Bars",5,1-Jul-17,"One of our favourite restaurants. Warm, friendly staff. Very helpful and took time to explain their menu every time we visited. The seafood and lobster are delicious and the sides are great as well! Value for money and be ready to get messy!"
The BOILER Seafood Bar & Beer,4.1,17,"Seafood, Bars",4,2-Oct-14,"We kicked off the lobster relvery with the Live whole Boston lobsters that are available in three different sauces. The Works (spiciness ranging from mild to raging hot), Garlic Butter and Peppa Butter. The Works is piquant with an assam-like tang, but not too spicy. With lobsters shipped in daily from US, the taste can hardly go wrong. Sweet and not overcooked, the chunky fleshes might be a hassle to remove from the shells at first but all efforts were rewarded when you mopped down with the sauces.  But we soon found out that it's got more to offer than the lobster. Pick from brown crabs, prawns, mussels, clams and then choose your sauce. That said, the heartiest way to round off the evening is to feast on the Boiler's Bombdiggity Bag ($139/4); literally a seafood bomb filled with everything including sausages, corns and some deep-fried mantou buns at the side for soaking up the juices.  The starters were overall quite impressive too. The Louisiana Spicy Mid Joint Wings ($8.90) were zappy with a nice sour kick that makes you grab for more. The Southern Chicks and Waffles ($9.90) had plenty of crisp, not only in the chicken but more importantly in the waffles that were drizzled in maple syrup. I shy away from the Bacon Shrimp ($11.90) in smoky Hickory sauce because they were too salty.  As for the Fish & Chips ($12.90), it's a classic in its own league. The fish stayed moist and piping hot within a light, crunchy batter.  The Signature Lobsicle ($15.90), aka lobster on Popsicle, might be safer in the Boiler instead of the deep fryer as they were too chewy.  Business was so good that the chocolate molten lava cake ran out of stock and so we settled for the C.B.D, a pungent pun on the business district of Singapore because it stood for Crispy Banana Durians. Forget about the Bananas were substituted by yams that night, cos the pungent durians have already stolen the limelight.  As we all know, never judge a restaurant by the history or the location. Despite being opened only for a few months, it's no nonsense when it comes to the Cajun-style lobsters here. Walk in, sit down and put on the apron. We did. And we ate. We ate very well indeed."
The BOILER Seafood Bar & Beer,4.1,17,"Seafood, Bars",4,29-Dec-15,'ello 'ello 'ello  *i trimmed my nails and wore dark clothing for the visit to the mighty crab temple*  Who would have thought there'd be a Louisiana seafood themed restaurant situated in the middle of nowhere.  And what's even more ridiculous is the large amounts of Hoomans here.  On a Tuesday work night!  Uh huh.  Ok so the plan. Order the sriracha fries. Order the bom diggity bag. Grab someone who has a birthday on that month and you get a complimentary lobster.  Fries for the win!!  Your day is now complete.  Not part of the plan: Echoey area.. This is NOT the place for intelligent conversations and discussions about your philosophies of life. Reserve and call in advance. If not you're just watching people eat. Backstreet boys playing in the background. Wut
The BOILER Seafood Bar & Beer,4.1,17,"Seafood, Bars",4,9-Aug-18,"Wonderful surprise, staff are so nice, and given the location, almost felt like we'd left Singapore. Crab cakes awesome, more crap than filler, sweet potato fries also perfect, 4 Seafood bags (Dungeness) fed 14 of us perfectly, with some to bring back. Huge prawns. Chilean Sauvignon Blanc washed it all down nicely. Only gripe, and hope management reads social media, is that they must refrigerate their ketchup. It was 'off' and had turned an unsightly, unappealing dark red color, with a nasty tang."
The BOILER Seafood Bar & Beer,4.1,17,"Seafood, Bars",5,21-Jul-18,Amazing seafood and the atmosphere is great!!! Came here with a pretty good sized group of 9 people. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly and the food was phenomenal. Ordered the $89 seafood bag and left more than satisfied. Must try the Yuzu ginza. My favorite drink of the night!!! If you're looking for a great place to eat and enjoy the atmosphere of Singapore this is the place to be.
The BOILER Seafood Bar & Beer,4.1,17,"Seafood, Bars",4,19-Nov-14,"It is all about Southern American Cajun seafood boil on our sunny island these days and we checked The Boiler, a gem tucked in the ulu and industrious Tai Seng estate. It's a queer location for a seafood spot but we absolutely dig the cavernous space and their delicious offerings.  It made perfect sense for us to order the Boiler's Bombdiggity Bag ($139) since there's a huge group of us (we had 3 bags of that). Each bag feeds more than the recommended 4 pax (that or we are small eaters). Dungeness or Brown Crab, prawns, mussels, clams, sausages, and corn are tossed with a sauce of your choice.  For the sauce, there's garlic butter (for the kiddos), pepper butter (for amateurs), mild, medium and raging spice. Of the lot, i thought that the mild worked the best. It was more savory than the bland and boring garlic butter, but not too spicy to give you a heartburn or mar the taste of the seafood.  Of the ingredients in the bag, I loved the succulent and juicy prawns, the salty chorizo style sausages, and not to mention the sweet corn! The juicy kernels provided a respite from the spices after a while.  Get a lobster ($49) to go with your meal! Same price as Pince and Pints but without the queue (just make a reservation)! I liked this better than the crabs. Lemon butter was a good choice as the sauce is lighter and simpler, which allowed the freshness of the lobster to come through. The pepper butter can be rather overwhelming with spice in my opinion and not quite suitable for this meat.  If you're not up for a seafood feasting, you could also do smaller meals such as fish and chips, chicken and waffles, and hot dogs as well.  For desserts, we had the Molten Lava cake ($9.90) which remained fairly decent even after all the photo taking. The almond (mocha?) ice cream with Oreo crunch was a hit with us.  Skip the fried banana and durian fritters ($7.90) with salted caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream. It sounded way more exotic than it tasted and certainly not quite worth the price for fried pisang. Plus it had a stale oily taste.  We really enjoyed our meal while it lasted. It was fun passing food around with our bare hands and letting loose at the dining table. However, the gastric reflux was pretty severe and the garlic aftertaste lingered long after the meal concluded. In fact, it's pretty nauseating thinking about it right now. So yes, it's a once in a blue moon indulgence for us.  That said, I'd certainly recommend The Boiler for a gathering with family and friends! What's your favorite seafood boil?"
The BOILER Seafood Bar & Beer,4.1,17,"Seafood, Bars",5,20-Jan-15,"Just had a lovely meal here with my family. We had the duo bag in mild sauce, lobster in garlic butter, fish & chips, and chicken with waffles. Loved every dish.  Service was attentive & quick, including the owner who was really hospitable. Will be back."
The BOILER Seafood Bar & Beer,4.1,17,"Seafood, Bars",4,13-Nov-14,"I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised by The Boiler. I haven't yet eaten at Cajun Kings, Crab in a Bag, or Dancing Crab, but it's clear that Louisiana-style seafood is the new big thing here.  Made my reservations online via Chope the afternoon off even though it was for Sunday dinner. I didn't think it'd be that crowded but boy was I wrong. For a restaurant located in the middle of an industrial zone, on a Sunday night, this place was PACKED. When we got there every table was full, and the nearest roadside parking was two streets down. Surprising, to say the least.  But hey, free parking on Sundays and after 5pm (I think) on weekdays means that despite its inaccessibility, it's quite worth driving in!  We were a large group of 10 people, so we got to order a fairly broad range of items. We ordered two of their bags (feeds four each), one mildly spicy, one garlic butter. We ordered a lobster (medium spicy) because it was on offer, and plenty of sides. Seafood first.  For $140+ per bag, it's good value. You get something like a whole crab, 6-8 pieces of prawns (maybe more, I wasn't counting), sausage, corn, mussels, clams, and some fried buns. The sauces are good too. The garlic butter was buttery rich and very garlicky. My only criticism is that by the time you're reaching the end of the bag, it's really heavy going. Conversely, the spicy sauces are less flavourful when you start out, but so much cleaner and lighter on the palate that you can keep going for longer. Mild spice is pretty disappointing for someone with the average Singaporean spice tolerance. I highly recommend medium. The corn in the bag was good, sweet and not overcooked. The crabs weren't the freshest I'd ever had, but they were still sweet and tasty.  I wouldn't bother recommending the lobsicles, which are bite-sized bits of deep fried lobster, despite their fame. There's just nothing special about them. The Momma's Potato Scoops are basically just wedges served with cheese sauce, and the Spam Fries are spammier than most places. Not as crisp as they could have been either. The coleslaw was average, fresh tasting, but it felt very odd eating coleslaw by hand.  I also feel the Jamaican alcoholic ginger beer is worth special mention. The alcohol taste is light, the ginger taste strong, and it's a great drink if you love ginger beer in general. (Though it's a bit sweet)  The best part of the entire meal was really that, drinks included, everything came out to only $70 per person. Considering the amount we ate? Definitely worth it. Quite looking forward to heading back to try the maximum spice level!"
The BOILER Seafood Bar & Beer,4.1,17,"Seafood, Bars",3,20-Sep-15,"visited the broiler with family to celebrate the younger brother's birthday. it was more of an experience than i would say the food. food was just average but cheaper than the other louisanna seafood stores.given the crowd on a sunday night(fullhouse) , maybe im missing out on something i wonder.  drinks wise,i had the beertini which is their version of beer and martini - turned out to be quite a refreshing choice to go with the seafood"
The BOILER Seafood Bar & Beer,4.1,17,"Seafood, Bars",4,10-Feb-15,"Good, but lacking in a few bits of Louisiana culture.  DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET YOUR HANDS DIRTY. You have been warned!  *Pros* The food is decent. The taste of the seafood in a bag is definitely cajun, and well marinated with the works. One whole bag (I can't remember which one I got) had enough crabs, prawns, mussels, cockles, corn and sausages enough for two to share. We also had the boston lobster (the price was on special!) marinated in garlic butter. The mid-joint wings was also pretty decent!  *Cons* Missing mallets! Mallets would be helpful, especially for the lobsters! And perhaps extra wet-wipes and napkins? How about putting a kitchen roll at the table? And what happened to the root beer? Cajun-style seafood dinners demand either beer, or root beer if you are driving... And I was driving. The waitress told us that they used to carry root beer, but stopped due to low demand. She also told us a few things were no longer on the menu due to pricing costs, including the every popular lobster-sicle.  Recommended: The Works Sauce, no matter what seafood you are getting! The bags are good value.  The removal of some essential items that make it a truly Louisiana experience was pretty sad, as I have experienced authentic US cajun before and unfortunately this was a derivative of the actual thing. But more importantly, which I hope the owners can probably read this, is that the marinade could possibly use a little stronger taste. The seafood is well marinated, but the cajun flavor I feel wasn't strong enough.  Overall, knowing that the restaurant is new, I'll give them a thumbs up for their effort, and hope that they can improve the authenticity and overall feel of southern-style seafood!"
The BOILER Seafood Bar & Beer,4.1,17,"Seafood, Bars",5,28-Dec-15,Definitely one of my best dining experiences in Singapore. Good was delicious and semi-healthy (not fried or overloaded with sugar). The food was served quickly and the lack of plates made for an interesting dining experience. One may be hesitant to dig in and get their hands dirty but this is a good ol American styled prawn feast... you just gotta get in there.
The BOILER Seafood Bar & Beer,4.1,17,"Seafood, Bars",5,16-Aug-14,"Fabulous dinning place. Great seafood, cosy place and warm services !!! Try them, we liked it!!!"
The BOILER Seafood Bar & Beer,4.1,17,"Seafood, Bars",5,6-Aug-16,This is one definitely one of the best among the Cajun Seafood joints that opened up recently. Reminiscent of the great Boiling crab joint in States. Seafood is fresh and the Dungeness crab is delicately sweet. The large succulent Prawns are definitely our favourite among all the fresh seafood. The works sauce is spicy and umami!! Will probably be one of our regular seafood joint going forward.
The BOILER Seafood Bar & Beer,4.1,17,"Seafood, Bars",5,21-Nov-14,"An excellent rendition of Louisiana style cooking. I've been to Boiling Crab in California. Was like looking for a similar experience here in Singapore and here it is! ""The works"" is the sauce here which is comparable to ""the whole shabang "" at the boiling crab. But the Pepper Butter sauce here is simply outstanding! It's a must try. The service staff are friendly and accommodating. They even offer you a plastic sleeve for your handphone in case you need to answer a call while your hands are covered in sauce... And yes , you need to use both your hands for a wholesome experience! The bib provided is clear plastic so it's not Selfie friendly but it gets the job done though. A wonderful place to hangout with friends and family. The beverage list is not bad , they have fruity refreshing beers and a wine selection too. To top it all off would be ""The Molten chocolate lava cake""! With a soothing cup of coffee! Bon Appetite!"
The BOILER Seafood Bar & Beer,4.1,17,"Seafood, Bars",3,5-Nov-14,"Just dropped by for coffee during lunch time...first time here, step in and impressed by the setup and cosy environment. However, things didn't turn out too well, service staff messed up our orders, waited for our dessert for nearly over 20 minutes but been told the dessert was sold out. Meanwhile, while waiting, the place getting smoky as we seated near kitchen, could be due to the bad ventilation and the whole place turns hazy smokes from the kitchen, left the place with just a cup of coffee without dessert and whole body smells."

The Original Katong Laksa,4.6,11,Singaporean,5,6-Jan-23,"Tucked inside a typical food hall is this laksa specialist serving an OG style laksa for the past 50 years.  The owner chef builds a bowl very quickly. First, a deep ladle to get the chunky, deeply spicy-seafoody bits from the bottom of a pot that has been simmering the base for hours. Then a quick drain of the soup to concentrate the gritty goodness of seafood, spices, coconutt. Top with bee hoong noodles, laksa leaves, and other toppings like cockles. Finished with a ladle of the soup base.  The only utensil you'll get is a spoon, as it should be."
The Original Katong Laksa,4.6,11,Singaporean,4,1-Apr-24,The laksa is yummy and delicious. Price so so and most attractive is the location of the place
The Original Katong Laksa,4.6,11,Singaporean,5,6-Nov-19,"This was one of my favorite laksa spots during my last trip to SGP. This time around it still maintained its high standards despite its fame. Even though it now has 2 new locations I still prefer this original store that once hosted Andrew Zimmern & Samantha Brown.  After having just eaten across the street at the other famed laksa place, we stopped by Roxy SQ for more laksa. We got the medium sized standard laksa for $5.50 SGD. the broth was just as satisfying as my previous visit here: rich, comforting & not overly salty. Compared to its competitor across the street, its brith is less spicy but has more of that distinctive nyonya flavor. I loved that layer of creamy substance on top of the laksa, texture similar to that of crab or shrimp brain roe. There were also adequate amount of seafood such as shrimps & cockles in the basic laksa.  Overall this remains my top 2 laksa spots in SGP. Despite its fame it is still delivering high quality laksa at very affordable locals' price."
The Original Katong Laksa,4.6,11,Singaporean,5,22-Jan-20,"WLE! Is damn good laksa lah!  Multiple local people have recommended this Nyonya Peranakan laksa to me, as the best in the East, and after visiting here I can see why. They've also told me that the other chain-variety in this area is ""over-rated"", ""not as good as it was"" and the never good to have ""oily"".  This soup-spoon laksa is souper satisfying all the way to the final slurp! They kindly add the chili down the side, so you can control the spice to your hearts content (I pushed the whole lot in and mixed it up). The 2 times I've had this lately were both post training, so I was already dripping before I started eating, so you can imagine what I looked like with the sambal sweats!  There isn't much else to say except it's absolutely delicious with thick juicy prawns, slurpy noodles & that amazing creamy coconut broth that defeats chopsticks!  One of the easiest 5's I've given - 100% recommended, I now do training just so I can come here to eat guilt-free.  P.S. You can get cockles, but I believe you have to ask for them - I usually include them as they add a sweet burst of flavour to your broth."
The Original Katong Laksa,4.6,11,Singaporean,5,5-Oct-18,"It was very good! You can use a spoon to eat. The ingredient is simple: shrimp, fish cake slices, noodles, there's no cockles.  Soup is not too spicy if you don't mix the chili stuff in.  I love it!"
The Original Katong Laksa,4.6,11,Singaporean,5,17-Feb-17,"I must give it a 5 as it's the best Laksa I have eaten in SG for the past decade. There is always a debate among my friends when we talk about Laksa, and many folks know about the 328 Katong Laksa and thought that's the best laksa in SG.  To be fair to 328 Katong Laksa, it used to be good - many years ago - but, now it's just very average; a 2.5-3 stars imo.  328 Katong Laksa is thought to be the best laksa in SG because it has branded itself really well, and has kept its vital location of being situated at the stretch where Katong Laksas used to be found.  A brief trip back to old days. As far back as 20 years ago, there used to be 3 Katong Laksa stalls in SG: 328 Katong Laksa and two others near to the current 328 Katong Laksa. The best that I used to eat was one little stall found in a typical old school coffee shop nestled in between the row of Katong shophouses.  I remember vividly enjoying my bowl of Laksa and seated next to me was a Nonya elderly lady eating the same. That's a stamp of approval cos the Nonyas are great cooks and if the elderly Nonya lady ate from that stall, that's indeed the best.  I really enjoyed the Laksa from that stall, eating it using a spoon. Chopsticks are banned when u eat Katong Laksa - no kidding!  I have tried all 3 Katong Laksa back then and my fav remained the little stall in that retro coffeeshop. Very unfortunately, that coffee shop closed for good probably more than a decade ago and I could never find the Katong Laksa that I used to love ever again.  I then had no choice but to eat at the other 2 laksa places. Eventually, only one was left and that's 328 Katong Laksa. I continued my search but to no avail. Fortunately, one of my friends told me that the best Katong Laksa is found at Roxy Square and I went there to try with high expectations.  Indeed! It tasted almost as good as the one that I used to have 20 years ago. Thereafter, I have been telling all my friends about it and have brought quite a few friends to try it. They all loved it.  Guess I'll continue to be spread my ""evangelism"" of telling and bringing my friends to this awesome laksa place. ^~^  #5/50 reviews for 2017 #laksatalk"
The Original Katong Laksa,4.6,11,Singaporean,5,20-Feb-17,"I must confess I had never really understood laksa. I understood even less what was all the fuss and debate about it. I'd had some decent, but overall dull laksas at different hawker centres. I must even say I almost gave up on it, thinking it was just some overrated, formless dish. Fortunately, my friend Van Z. took me to this discreet place in Katong. It's just a stall in a very small eatery inside Roxy Square. There is not even a big sign, as opposed to the famous 328 Katong laksa, which appears to be more a place to take selfies than one to have a good meal.  Anyway, I approached this bowl of laksa with skepticism and was blown away after the first spoonful. This was neither overly spicy nor too sweet. All the flavours were balanced in a delightful combination where none of them overpowered any other. I could taste many distinct flavours: coconut, curry, shrimp, oysters, fish... I guess the best way to describe this is like a beautiful mosaic of flavours, where different, individual tastes made one wholesome dish, as opposed to a melting pot, where everything combines into a single thing. The only word that comes to my mind is ""shiok"".  This little stall changed my previous conceptions about laksa. It's always a joy to be proven wrong. Specially when it is about food."
The Original Katong Laksa,4.6,11,Singaporean,4,24-Jul-12,"There has always been a debate about the real Katong laksa. And you only need to ask someone born and bred in Katong where to find it. No, it isn't the lady with the red hair, and it isn't 328 Katong Laksa, or any of those. Sure they're good, but these are not the laksa stalls you are looking for.  The original laksa has moved a few times, and can now be found in the food court on the ground floor of Roxy Square. For all its fame, the small is tiny, and still has a picture of the original Janggut (Malay for beard) uncle to display its authenticity. Some say the quality has gone done, and I wouldn't be surprised because the stall has shifted management from the original uncle to his sons and daughters several times.  If it's nostalgia or legitimacy you're looking for, head to this stall. Even it it's just so you can be a laksa hipster and say, I know the REAL katong laksa, and I tried it before you did."
The Original Katong Laksa,4.6,11,Singaporean,4,4-Jul-16,"Honestly, when the bowl was served to me, I wasn't very impressed with it. I ordered the medium sized one at $5. Original laksa served from 50 years ago in a plastic bowl? With a few measly prawns on top, it doesn't look all too great.  However, after tasting it, I can see why it may well be the original laksa from that long time ago.  This is the most 'Nyonya' laksa I've ever tasted. At the first mouthful what I tasted was its saltiness and kinda transports me back to where Katong used to be, just beside the sea. (Back then there was no Marine Parade). And then I can almost imagine the sea breeze blowing... No it was the air con actually when reality hit me.  And there is the coconut milk that doesn't come off too strong unlike other laksa where the milkiness of the laksa comes off right out centre. For this, the milkiness was there but it doesn't take center stage. It allowed the whole flavor of the laksa and nyonya-ness take the attention. Other places would have you have the prawns etc be centre and I am a little disappointed how they made the prawns to be almost like an afterthought. I would have imagined that the other katong laksas are sort of improved over time. There were really good ones but one can't help but think they have evolved with the times and somehow also lost the Nyonya flavor.  This stall's soup and noodles are great and one of a kind in Katong. They retained the tradition and the recipe. The whole package were comforting and perfectly blended. With the way they handled the prawns and the presentation, it's just sad that they weren't a bigger deal than they could be."
The Original Katong Laksa,4.6,11,Singaporean,4,31-Aug-13,"Be it janggut laksa, marine parade laksa or the original katong laksa, these three names have one thing in common: they refer to the same famous traditional laksa originally started in the 70s by a food peddler nicknamed Janggut. Although there is an ongoing debate about which is the best Katong laksa and I would gladly eat any if presented before me, my favorite so far has to be from this store at Roxy square. The chili paste can only be described as fragrant and the uniquely coagulated coconut-based curry soup is strangely light but flavoursome. I don't think I'd ever drink up the soup of any other laksa so gladly.  The price is very reasonable, and the staff is extremely friendly. I last visited at an off-peak time on a weekday so there wasn't anyone else there and our food arrived quickly, with a huge smile from the amiable lady boss. My only gripe is that the rest of the ingredients didn't quite stand out, like the prawns and such, but for the soup base and noodles, it is more than worth the trip."
The Original Katong Laksa,4.6,11,Singaporean,5,8-Aug-18,"Best laksa in sg to date. Old school, traditional and classic. The model laksa I must say"
Wildseed Cafe,4.5,2,"Cafes, Bars, Juice Bars & Smoothies",5,5-Jan-23,"We had to get high tea in Singapore, so we made a reservation at the Wildseed Caf¨¦ at the Alkaff Mansion. The mansion and gardens were beautiful, and we loved the outdoor seating. The Afternoon Tea set is meant for two to share, but we shared it amongst three people. It is $58 and comes with two pots of tea and an assortment of tasty sweets and savouries arranged very prettily. We chose the Nymph of the Nile and Earl Grey Lavender teas. The Nymph of the Nile was a favourite. This is a very Insta-worthy spot for tea or brunch with the gals."
Wildseed Cafe,4.5,2,"Cafes, Bars, Juice Bars & Smoothies",4,10-Sep-20,"I am in love with this cafe. Went for dinner at Txa Pinto and they recommended we check out Wildseed in the day, so we did!  We sat outdoors by the green gazebo. It was just soooo pretty. The drinks were also good, I had the chai, my friends drinks like the wildseed cafe special drink looked much better/insta worthy. But both tasted great!  The food wasn't anything that blew me away, but it's pretty decent. This is the perfect cafe for a brunch catch up with friends or a date. Loooove."
Lou Shang Â¥ÉÏ,4,1,Themed Cafes,4,8-Nov-23,"Lunch at Lou Shang @ 38 Prinsep Street.  ""Lou Shang"" is Mandarin for ""Upstairs"".  It's a speakeasy concept.  Level 1 is Mama Diam, a cafe that opens in the later part of the day, also owned by the same people who own Lou Shang.  Lou Shang located on level 2 via what looks like a lift door. Press the button and the door slides open to a HDB setting.  In the background, the song Home sung by Kit Chan was playing.  After that, there were many Mandarin songs.  Small Bite Roti Hey! Tiger prawn, French Baguette, Nonya Chicken Curry  It's isn't small!  Curry tastes good but I don't like the toasted baguette all soggy. I would have preferred it sans chicken curry. They put some curry leaves on top too.   Oink Oink ---------- Homemade Tortiglioni, Braised Pig's Trotter, Mushroom  Taste is good. Meat is very tender. I'm told it's braised for 4 hours. Found a few nice tender chestnuts which I love.  Homemade Tortiglioni - doesn't look like it at all in terms of the shape ? It's too thick for my liking. Got to skip this as I had ordered another small bite which isn't small at all.  No ""kopi tiam"" kind of coffee which is what I like. So had this:  Pandan Kaya Latte with Butterscotch Salted Cream - nice.  Overall the food is nice although it's fusion food which is not my first love."
Yakinikutei Ao-Chan,4.8,4,Japanese,5,11-Mar-18,"Very nice Japanese BBQ joint tacked in the Hotel - I guess this is the secret Japan town from 90s with the original Japanese owner.  Food quality is excellent, service is what you'd expect from Japanese venue. Quality is superb.  The lady running the shop is super sweet, she's very helpful and I was really happy to find myself and my business client dinning in this great place."
Yakinikutei Ao-Chan,4.8,4,Japanese,5,20-Jan-19,One of the best Yakiniku in Singapore. Go for the unusual cuts eg beef intestines (Gobchang) & the flank ribs.
Yakinikutei Ao-Chan,4.8,4,Japanese,4,16-Dec-15,"It's good but not the best I've tried. Tried the BBQ during lunch, had the lunch set with the beef and tongue. I haven't tried many jap BBQ in Singapore yet so I don't know if I can agree with the rest of the reviews that say it's the best. Comparing to LA jap bbq's like manpuku, or Hong kong's 298 NIKUYA, this one is not quite there yet for me. So 3.5 stars round up to 4."
Yakinikutei Ao-Chan,4.8,4,Japanese,5,16-Sep-12,"best yakiniku place in town!  we used to love gyu-kaku, but then they changed the tare sauce, and we moved to ao-chan :)  get the belly tender prime, and ox tail soup. they're really good. some folks like the shiso rice too."
Hai San Chicken Rice,5,1,Chinese,5,2-Mar-13,"Singaporeans are inexplicably passionate about this apparently simple dish of chicken and flavored rice. I am honestly not bear-baiting when I say that Hai San chicken rice is the best roast chicken rice in Singapore.  Hai San has been serving the same quality of roast chicken rice since the 1970s. In fact they used to serve these wonderful caramelized spicy roasted chicken wings, ""hiam sit"", which sadly are no longer available on their menu. Hai San was doing business at the Henderson market till about two years ago when the market was renovated and they had to move to their current location, Tiong Bahru Wet Market and Food Center. You walk up the escalators at the front entrance and walk straight exactly 126 paces and arrive at Hai San Hainanese Chicken Rice.  Chicken rice is widely associated with the boiled version as shown on numerous food and travel shows, to the unfortunate exclusion of the roasted variety. Ok, it's still room temperature chicken served over aromatic rice boiled in chicken stock and fat, but it's a dish that lends itself poorly to language and description. Also, I'm just too lazy to try to find the right words and phraseology to adequately convey the true genius of this apparently simple dish. Truly, it's hard, very hard work wordsmithing the experience that is roast chicken rice...that and I'd rather just hang out at Bar Bar. You just have to go experience it for yourself. What's the point of drawing breath if not for a series of sensory experiences.  I recommend having the Char Siew or roast pork loin if it looks good to you. The char siew will be of the tender variety; no chewy char siew here. Definitely ask for a chicken liver (they run out of these VERY early!).  I've included a picture of the chili, because as an erstwhile schoolmate pointed out, ""It is all about the chili"". While I think that may be overstating the case somewhat, she's not far off the mark. It is 97.4% about the chili. Hai San's is hot, so go gently into that red night. There is a strong hit of garlic and then some cool lime-y notes. It's about this time that you need another hit...because, oh baby, it burns so good!"
Ippudo,4.5,4,Ramen,4,18-May-24,I ordered Bonito Tonkosu tamago and Karaka tamago ramen. I love the Tonkosu broth which favor full and creamy. The restaurant has great ambience with a lot of tables. We sat at the bar watching the chef is cooking our ramen during waiting for the food. Overall the food was delicious! They a charge $2.50 for water so no need to ask.

Ippudo,4.5,4,Ramen,4,7-Aug-22,Most certainly one of the best Ramen restaurants I've tried. The ramen comes in different degree of stringy noodles. The broth is thick and creamy. One of the surprising item is the roasted corn. It's very good. The only gripe I have is how expensive the beer is!

Ippudo,4.5,4,Ramen,4,5-Feb-18,"My boyfriend and I just wanted a snack and not full on ramen so we just ordered three appetizers. The staff was so nice and not pushy about us ordering more. Someone saw that we had book bags on so s/he showed us they provided baskets under the table for us to put our stuff in. 11/10 for service.  But their food was just alright. Maybe their ramen is a different story though. We ordered a pork bun and a chicken bun. The buns we had in ippudo nyc were way better. I think if they added some amazing sauce or just more sauce in general, it would've been really tasty. The lemon soda drink was quite refreshing. They gave us more syrup on the side but it was fine without it. My boyfriend messed up and added it towards the end and the drink ended up tasting like diabetes. Also got some fried corn fritters or something like that. Did not like it but basically tasted like what it sounds like lol. The takoyaki wasn't bad!  We weren't interested in the ramen but noticed how expensive they were! A lot of them were around $21."

The waiters were really friendly and didn't make me feel awkward about eating alone.  I had a lemonade soda which seemed to be a special at the time, and it was really good. It came with an extra can of soda water and a small glass jug of simple syrup, which was so cute and made it easy to refill my drink to the sweetness I wanted.  I also got some soba. The broth was SUPER good, a bit lemony and rich while still being more of a soba broth than your typical ramen broth. The pork was good too, quite large slices. The noodles were cooked really well, not too soft and not too hard. And I loved the egg, it was cooked perfectly, not too runny and not too hard.  It was a bit expensive, but I don't really mind since I was treating myself :) It's something to keep in mind though, if you're just stopping in for lunch."

They are adjacent to the food court stalls- not too hard to find.  Since I have only heard of Ippudo's ramen (from folks who have eaten it in NY)- I had to give it a shot since it was so close by.  I ordered the Shiro Tamago. The broth was perfect- porky flavor but not over the top in terms of richness and oiliness. I wish there was more than 1 thin slice each of pork belly and pork loin. For 3 extra dollars you get more. Flavored egg was cooked perfectly- halfway runny on the inside.  Having lunch here is pricey though. Altogether my bowl of rament came to close to 24 SGD. I mean, I get that they're in an expensive mall with their own exclusive space...but man, that's steep."

Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,9-Sep-23,"I had a strong craving for chicken rice late at night. It was my very first chicken rice store that's not located inside a food court. It didn't disappoint. Amazing food, great customer service, clean bathrooms and great outdoor seatings!  Food:  - White chicken (10/10): This was my favorite dish of the day! It's a chicken rice restaurant for a reason. The meat texture was mildly chewy, and the seasoning wasn't too oily, the portion was satisfying enough!  - Chicken rice (10/10): The loyal companion of those chicken meat! The rice wasn't soggy. It had great texture and flavor! It was so good, I got 2 bowls of these mouthwatering rice, one was simply not enough!  - BBQ Stingray (7/10): Not the best, the sauce (it was delicious though) given was too little and the meat was kind of dry.  - White Garlic Bak Choy (9/10): This was pretty good, but it wasn't served warm. Seasoning was just right (wasn't too salty) unlike some other restaurants serving the same dish!  Overall, I would recommend this restaurant. The only thing I would say is if you decide to get their stingray, maybe ask for more of the sauce (I can't guarantee if they would meet your request, but it's worth a try!"

Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,27-Feb-19,"Smiley friendly staff is very important and Five Star has done it! You have an option to eat outside or inside fully air-conditioned(which we went with in 37 degrees weather)!! Comfortable seating, it's got everything you need if you want to try out authentic dishes such as, hainanese chicken,cereal prawns, tong choi (veggies) with fried shallots and shrimp paste, fish ball noodles, you name it. Everything tasted very good especially the cereal prawns, and had a lot of ""wok hay"", meaning the food was cooked very well with the chef's techniques. This restaurant is nicely situated in the Katong area, near a beach and surrounded by many other amenities. I would definitely suggest this area if you want to explore more local eats away from downtown Singapore."

Even though the prices are slightly above average (compared to hawker stands/food courts) it was still worth! The service was acceptable and the portions were larger than hawker stalls! The back room having AC was a nice bonus!  I tried a few dishes and the seafood hor fun shined the brightest! Although it was good, I would rather explore other options before coming back again! I'd recommend coming thru at least once!"
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,29-Nov-21,It is what it is i.e. five star chicken rice. Chicken is always tender and tasty. One of the better hainanese chicken rice you can get in Singapore.
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,9-May-16,"Five star has always been my nbr 1 for chicken rice + zi char. Love the way they prepare the food, texture, spices, sauces and variety. Nothing too overcooked nor tough, all is right which explains my frequent visit and in all fairness, i did try other places (refer to other reviews). Someone in her review mentioned about their chicken being too dry- im not sure if she was being served beast meat or thigh but you are welcomed to inform the staff which part of the chicken you prefer. As for unfriendly staffs, as with all humans, during peak hours they can get busy trying to serve everyone but they are definitely not unfriendly. Comon, cut them some slack, they are in service line. All in all, i will be back!  P.s. Their salted egg pork ribs is a must try!"
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,4-Oct-16,"Came here around 2 am since it's one of the few places in the area still operating at those hours. The staff was incredibly friendly and seated me right away, even though it was obvious that they are already starting to close up for the night.  Ordered the Kampong chicken at 2 people's portion and Kangkong just for myself because I was mad hungry. The waiter was also nice enough to ask if I wanted the chicken deboned. Honestly, I have never been provided with this option before, and so I just kinda froze like a deer in headlights. Told him either way would be fine, since I have never had issue with bone and I was so hungry I probably would've just chewed through it anyway.  Chicken (deboned) arrived first and it was promptly devoured. Texture was really tender, and it had a good natural chicken flavor without being greasy at all, even though it was served with skin. I'm not sure why, but chicken in US just doesn't quite have that same flavor... Guessing it's probably the feed and the general growing/processing method.  The kangkong came a bit mushy, but it was still devoured within minutes. The chicken kinda stole the limelight, and I honestly can't recall much about the veggie..."
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,13-Aug-18,We got tips from locals on best chicken and rice places. We tried all of them but the one place they left off was Five Star. Accidentally discovered this place and I'm glad I did. I would name this place as the best boiled chicken and rice place in Singapore. Not only the chicken was incredible but their super flavorful rice is what put it over the top. In addition they have other amazing authentic dishes. Definitely try their soup selection. Highly recommend it.
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,31-Aug-14,"Mmm probably one of my favorite Singaporean dishes! My friend and I came here for dinner and ordered the hainan chicken rice with the pork ribs in egg batter (I think that's what it was called?). Super yummy and service is very much quick and efficient! When you order the chicken, you can select your cut of what kind of chicken meat you want, and it comes with some pickled vegetables and a serving of chicken soup. Seating is outdoor and there are fans everywhere so you manage to stay cool. All in all, such a delicious meal and one that I would recommend to anyone looking to try some chicken rice in Singapore!  tldr; yum yum, my favorite Singaporean dish"
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,2-Sep-12,"In my mind, there are only three contenders for best chicken rice in Singapore - the one at Tiong Bahru Market, Chin Chin, and Five Star. And given that Five Star is of closest proximity to my abode, it's no wonder that this is my first pick when poultry cravings hit.  Cool, silky tender chicken atop a mound of soy sauce and sesame oil drenched cucumbers. Hot, fragrant rice. Spicy, garlicky chili. A generous serve of steaming soup. There's nothing missing in this picture, really.  Sure, it's as unglamorous as they come - sitting out next to a busy road with auntie waitresses squawking orders overhead, but the bustling ambience of being in the presence of famous food is unbeatable. Price wise, it's not cheap, but neither is it exorbitant. And if only visit sporadically, it's all the more worth it to splurge, both in terms of calories and clams."
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,6-Sep-14,"I'm usually not much if a carb eater.... But this has got to be some of the best rice I've ever had, I had two servings! I nearly forgot about the chicken! The hainan rice cooked in chicken fat, juices, and spices along with chili and ginger mixed inside is just incredible. Chicken itself was also outstanding, very moist and flavourful!  Other outstanding dishes include the baby gai lan and the fried tofu. Protip, ask for specific parts like the wing or breast only if dining alone and they can accommodate."
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,1-Oct-16,"My favorite chicken rice place. Flavorful and not oily. They serve Kampong chicken which lends a unique taste. Kampong chicken tends to be smaller than commercial chicken, so you might need to order more than usual. Or just order more because it is soooo good."
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",3,17-Jul-15,A good place to go for some late-night chicken rice (especially after Tian Tian left Joo Chiat Road!)  The chicken is nowhere near as fatty as the ones that Tian Tian have but the rice and chilli are excellent. And because it opens till late it's always a good option for nocturnal beings in the neighbourhood.
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,12-Jan-18,"Came here and dined for two. Ordered their roasted chicken for two and had the hong kong kailan (the one with oyster sauce). It was a great meal. The clear soup wasn't bland, so it actually added flavor to the rice. The chili and garlic were great too. the kampong chicken was succulent and juicy, the rice was fluffy and not hard / dry. The kailan was sliced thinly, so it's not a chore to eat the stems. And the oyster sauce was generous. It was a great lunch, except for one gripe. The lady kept taking away our chili / garlic and putting it on a different table. Yaaaa I mean we've taken some in our saucers, but then every time we wanted more, we'd have to call for service for her to take the tray back to our table, then she'd take it away again. And so we had to ask for it again afterwards. So I just gave up. Haha. Sad. But that's the only thing stopping me from giving it a 5 star. Maybe there are better chicken rice places, but if you're in the katong / joo chiat area, this is definitely one to try (and compare to your favorite chicken rice place)."
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,5-Apr-15,Generally very good chicken and rice. Sweet and sour pork was nice as well. Priced fairly. I've had better in china but I'm gonna low my standards here.
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,19-Feb-18,One of my favourite hainanese chicken rice in the east. The kampung chicken meat is tender and soft. Rice is cooked just right. Chilli sauce is one of the best
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,24-Jan-18,It is truly 5 star chicken!! Order their fish head curry as well. So surprised they did it well. Not most chinese restaurants do for my experience. Staff are nice and helpful in ordering
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",3,15-May-14,"After hearing about this place for the past six years from local friends, I made it a mission to visit this place during my trip. Keep in mind this is only the second time I have had Hainanese chicken in Asia.  Be prepared for quick service and lean and juicy chicken at this joint.  Smooth and juicy fragrant kampong (supposedly free range) chicken with hot fragrant chicken rice. Chuck some chilli on top and that meal disappeared pretty quickly.  The soup was quite salty so I only had a few sips as it was super hot in Singapore and though it was unlimited, I don't understand how one can have steaming soup in 30 degree weather."
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,13-Aug-12,"Very famous chicken rice in Singapore!!!  I can't get sick of eating the chicken rice from here. Sure, it is a slightly more expensive that what you usually pay for chicken rice, but come on, it can't be more expensive than what you pay at Chatterbox! At least this tastes really good, and you pay for quality. They use kampong chicken, which means the meat is lean yet tender. Coupled with the succulent rice, everything is just about right!  For a more balanced meal, you can also order other dishes such as the home-style tofu, vegetables and prawn roll. Five Star isn't famous for no reason!"
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,21-Jul-12,"Katong is known for its many eateries and this is one of the famous ones. Just a note, If you're driving, parking can be quite a problem along this stretch of road.  Anyhow, 5 Star chicken rice isn't the cheapest stall in town but its probably among the top few in Singapore. They use kampong chickens, which supposedly have less fat content and are therefore healthier. Nevertheless, the chicken meat is tasty and tender and the rice isn't too oily. I usually ask for of the gravy that comes with the chicken because it goes well with the rice.  Their Hometown Tofu is also worth trying."
Five Star Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.3,27,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,19-Aug-16,"Great chicken rice, and legit pricing.

Although, I found the Haianese chicken rice to be good... The chicken was rather slim in meat. Stay away from the stir fry noodles. It was tasteless.  I had the food to go but when I pass by this place it's always packed at night. Typically, seating is outside in the Singapore heat."
Seiwaa Okonomiyaki & Teppanyaki Restaurant,4,5,Teppanyaki,4,1-Apr-21,An authentic izakaya which serves up the classic Osaka street food staples of okonomiyaki and teppenyaki. It's a popular place so make sure you reserve if you want tables with the hot plate. Totally worth it.  We tried the pork okonomiyaki chicken teppenyaki and gyoza. Washed it down with some chilled Sapporo! Food is excellent and service is great as the staff will make the dishes in front of you on the grill. Highly recommended!!
Seiwaa Okonomiyaki & Teppanyaki Restaurant,4,5,Teppanyaki,3,10-Jul-21,"Clean and nice service staff; each table has a bell to call for a waiter. The agedashi tofu was good, perfectly cooked with a crispy outside and soft inside. The seafood okonomiyaki was fine, although I wish there was an option with only squid and without prawn. Each table has its own containers of bonito flakes, seaweed, and mayo, so you can add toppings yourself. I went for a light lunch, but saw others in the restaurant doing teppanyaki or cooking their own takoyaki, which seems like a fun interactive experience. (EDIT: it seems from other reviews that you can typically cook your own okonomiyaki, and I'm disappointed I was not told about/unable to experience this) Don't wear your favorite clothing because it will strongly of food afterwards."
Seiwaa Okonomiyaki & Teppanyaki Restaurant,4,5,Teppanyaki,4,26-Feb-17,"Wallet friendly prices for Japanese DIY savory cabbage pancakes.  Okonomiyaki (directly translated means ""grilled how you like"") is a Japanese savory pancake topped with different ingredients, including diced cabbage and either seafood or other meat. Each pancake ranges in price from S$12-16 depending on the ingredients.  This particular place is a grill-it-yourself establishment. The batter and ingredients are brought out to you, you mix and grill it on the hotplate (teppan) in front of you. You're instructed to flip it after 7 mins. After 7 mins on each side you get top it with sauce, mayo, seaweed and bonito flakes.  They also serve monjayaki, a (much messier) Japanese pan-fried batter that is crispy on one side and chewier on the other and eaten directly from the hotplate.  I found the prices reasonable for Japanese comfort food, though it might be too much work cooking the items yourself. Good for group gatherings and generally having fun at the grill.  The restaurant is located right smack in Little India between many indian restaurants and budget hotels, so it might be a little hard to find.  Overall, budget friendly and a fun dinner out. Will be back for the rest of the teppanyaki items."
Seiwaa Okonomiyaki & Teppanyaki Restaurant,4,5,Teppanyaki,5,31-Mar-18,This is a very authentic okonimiyaki place located within Little India. You get to cook your own okonimiyaki with either classic flavours such as seafood/pork or with added singaporean signature flavours like chilli crab or sambal. The shop is decorated very authentically and service is quite good!
Seiwaa Okonomiyaki & Teppanyaki Restaurant,4,5,Teppanyaki,4,15-Oct-18,"Tasty Okonomiyaki, great service. They will prepare a vegetarian version if you ask for it even though it's not on the menu. Rather small place so better reserve a table."
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,3,18-Jan-17,"At critical mass, expect no privacy - this place was jammin'! Personal space is not in the cards.  On the other hand, the food, was acceptable. However, I couldn't wrap my head around the crowd and the absence of intimacy. Service was hurried and I felt rushed. The frenzied energy was too much for me.  While the yakitori was good, what's with the sashimi? Why not stick to grilled meat. Keep it simple.  The menu seems stretched and it affects the staff."
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,4,9-Dec-12,"This is a review of a group dinner with colleagues at Kazu Sumiyaki in Cuppage Plaza.  I had not been to Cuppage Plaza before. I was the first to arrive. So, I was left standing outside of the restaurant awaiting my colleagues who had made the dinner plans. I am relatively sure the young ladies from the KTVs thought I was there for something else.  This is a small room. It is also quite busy. It has a bustling feel to the ambiance. The room does also maintain a Japanese aesthetic. Everyone seems to be thorougjly delighted by the food.  The service was professional and efficient. It was polite but not overly friendly. Kazu seems to be centered around getting your order and then, in a fast but relatively well paced manner, delivering your food to the table.  The food was consistently very good. It was well prepared. There were dishes (ie Shishamo - aka pregnant fish) that I did not enjoy. I do not think there is a way to prepare it that I would enjoy it. I do not like the grainy texture. The presentation was basic and very straight-forward.  One person did pretty much all of our ordering. After that, it was just a crazy culinary ride with dishes appearing in a constant stream.  I am not going to comment on each dish. I will divide them into groups and provide a link to a photo. As you can see, by far, most things are in the ""Things I liked a lot"" section.  Things I liked a lot.

It arrived in the middle of the food maelstrom. I tried it, thought it was ok and quickly turned my attention back to foods wrapped in bacon.  http://tinyurl.com/b3v942y   Things I didn't like:  Shishamo (pregnant fish)  http://tinyurl.com/ahzm6aa  Rice Soup  http://tinyurl.com/cfsrkk3  Overall - I really enjoyed the energetic vibe of the restaurant. It is not very large. it is full of people ordering loads of food and enjoying it. The staff is working briskly to insure food and drink continues to flow to the table. The menu is vast but the quality of the food does not appear to be deterred by this. Kazu Sumiyaki provided some very delicious food I just think this is a great dining experience."
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,5,1-Oct-12,"I'd never been to Cuppage Plaza until coming to Kazu last summer. hmmm....talk about an old Singapore throwback. It's an older building with KTV bars on every floor and young women hanging over the railings on the lookout for clients.  So I was pleasantly surprised upon arriving at Kazu to discover a more traditional restaurant, absolutely packed with people. Sumiyaki apparently means ""charcoal griled"" and most items on the menu seem to involve meat on a stick.  Between the five of us we tried a ton of items. The standouts: foie gras, scallops, pork belly, wagyu beef, bacon wrapped anything Really, it was all so very delicious, especially with a Sapporo to wash everything down.  The restaurant isn't that spacious at all, so reservations might be essential for dinner."
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,5,16-Feb-17,"So I was dropping off my laundry in this kind of dumpy looking building, and was intrigued by all the restaurants - especially Japanese - inside it. Wandered around a bit through the various floors and did a Google search, ended up here. Was one of the most memorable meals of a six week trip through SE Asia. It's not cheap, but the quality is quite good and there are just a ton of different types of dishes to try. Bacon wrapped scallops, wagyu beef, various pork belly preparations, beef and chicken meatballs, sausage, really there was not a single miss.  We were lucky to walk in and get a table on a Thursday night, but they told us we needed to be out by a certain time. The place was packed. I would definitely recommend getting reservations."
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,5,27-Oct-13,"Whenever I want my sashimi and yakitori fix, Kazu comes to mind. Its a hole-in-the-wall sort of place but the food never fails to impress. Like all great food places in Singapore, booking in advance is a must.  Service is efficient and the place is a little crowded as they tend to cramp in as many seats as possible. This place is famous for its yakitori. I also like to order their sashimi specials as well as seasonal food items.  Overall, it is a rather pricey restaurant for its ambience but the food makes up for it - enough that you don't suffer an indigestion after paying the bill!  One more thing ..... whenever I can't get a booking here and I have a bad craving for yakitori and sashimi that simply needs to be satiated, there's another place at Clark Quay to go to!"
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,4,11-May-17,This place be delicious.  Order many meats on sticks. Wash it down with premium sake (or whiskey). Pay kind of a lot for it. But leave full and happy.  They have 2-seatings for dinner (6:00pm & 8:00pm). GO EAT AT THIS PLACE.  FOOD (must try): * Fatty pork w/ apple sauce * Foie gras * Ox tongue * Chicken meatball (w/ egg yolk) * Lamb yaki * Garlic rice  SERVICE: * 2 thumbs up * Consistent  PRICE: * $$$ (around $55-65 per pax w/o booze)  OVERALL: * Great for groups of 4-6 * Dinner over lunch * protip: they have a selection of Suntory whiskeys for around $200-250 / bottle
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,5,10-Jul-15,"Absolutely sublime. Who knew meat-on-a-stick could be elevated to such a level!  Every single skewer arrived at the table grilled to perfection. I've been to many a robatayaki, kushiyaki, and sumiyaki-type place and it compares favorably to a very good place in Japan.  it was pretty much hard to choose a favorite menu item. The foie gras was delicately crispy on the outside and buttery on the inside. The grilled whole scallop was amazingly fresh and a symphony of flavors. Other items are the beef tongue, pork belly, chicken wings and the creamy, custard-like Japanese sweet potato. Order the sweet potato right at the beginning of your meal, as it takes a good 30-40 minutes to prepare.  Ask for the off-menu seasonal items as well, and depending on what arrived that day, you might be treated to an amazing combination of dishes. A reservation is absolutely necessary as this place is completely packed. Don't let the price put you off - you get what you pay for.  I usually skip Cuppage Plaza as the contents of this building are mostly pretty shady. I was reminded again as the ladies of the night congregated outside one of the numerous bars as I left the restaurant.  The faint smell of barbecue still lingered on the shirt, a reminder of my visit to possibly the best place in Singapore for Japanese-style charcoal grilled items..."
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,4,26-May-14,"Over a year since I first bookmarked this, we finally went there tonight. These guys know how to grill and season meat extremely well. This is better than at least half of the Izakaya places I have been to in Tokyo, and they speak English here which is helpful. The fish fillet wrapped in bacon was beautiful. Like pretty much all of the rest of the meal, it was juicy and flavorful.  In my opinion, the shortcomings were how about half of the things we wanted to order were sold out, and then they forgot the rice we wanted (and when it came after we asked for it a second time, it was not brown rice as we had ordered but we didn't want to incur another wait by sending it back).  It was about $120 and we were both full. We will return."
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,5,25-Sep-15,"We had an excellent dinner here. The staff was very friendly and helpful in describing the specials and regular menu items.  Reservations are highly recommended. And don't get turned off by the location. The building seems a bit downscale, but this place is worth going to."
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,5,26-Jul-13,"Originally the wait was an hour, but a single seat surreptitiously opened. I sat at the bar in front of the tiny grill. It's surprising that one meter of flame can feed 50 in a timely manner. I ordered the cold green tea buckwheat noodles, chicken meatballs, sweet leek and sweet onion skewers. The food was fast, the flavors uncomplicated but well balanced. The quality of the raw food is enhanced by the careful attention of the chef. Kazu Sumiyaki isn't fancy, but the service is efficient, immediate and knowledgable. I really enjoyed my meal and highly recommend Kazu Sumiyaki."
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,4,15-Oct-12,"Kazu is a pretty small dinky place, and located on the 4th floor of Cuppage Plaza so if I didn't already know it was there, I probably wouldn't have stumbled upon the place. It gets crowded though, so do make reservations if you can!  The food overall is pretty good. My friends had been there before so I let them do the ordering, which were mostly grilled skewers of stuff. I particularly like the Tontoro Ringo (pork with apple bits), the bacon wrapped enoki mushrooms, prawn with scallops and leek.  One problem though: we ordered the Foie Gras and reminded them several times, but for some reason that dish just never arrived, quite oddly. And for the ladies to note, Cuppage Plaza in the evening is a little bit dodgy with lots of KTV pubs in the building."
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,5,2-Sep-12,"Kazu is one of my favourite places for sumiyaki, i.e. charcoal grilled"" (sumi meaning charcoal and yaki meaning grilled). It's a bit cramped and almost always filled to capacity, because the food is amazing!  I love the foie gras it is beautifully seared yet soft and creamy inside. I also love the wagyu beef, the tsukune and chicken soft bone as well as the hotate with cheese and the pork belly avocado.  Not such a big fan of the tontoro with apple though.  Kazu is a bit pricey but definitely worth it!"
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,5,17-Mar-13,"The restaurant is in an almost soulless building but in contrast, it is almost always full house and require reservation to be made. The place was not big and we were immediately seated at a corner and the next moment, a bowl of cabbage and special sauce was allocate to us  I already conclude that this is one of the best Yakitori restaurant in Singapore when I tried the first skew. Its meatball was juicy and nicely marinated unlike the normal dried ones you find at other place.  It wasn't easy to get our stomach filled since the food was really nice and one serving wasn't enough. We had garlic fried rice, pork meatball, pork maki of avocado, enoki mushroom, the seasonal squid, pork apple, foie gras which were all very good till my friend commented that they are so heavenly especially the foie gras. We had more than one serving for most of the stuff.  Don't worry about the sticks laying around the table like satay stick as the restuarant provide a container at every table for those finished sticks.  Ask for seasonal stuff but expect a steeper price. So, please remember to ask for the price before ordering."
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,4,14-Apr-14,"Best beef tongue I've had in my life. It was perfectly seasoned and super tender. Chicken hearts & pork belly were also standouts for me. I'm not much of a drinker but I do love me some plum wine. I was ecstatic when I found out they make their own! It was so refreshing and the perfect accompaniment to a delicious meal. I'll be back Kazu...oh, I'll be back."
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,5,29-Aug-17,"Every bite was beautifully prepared. The wagyu skewers were a particular favorite, and I adored the pancake balls as well. The space can get a little cramped and noisy, and I'd definitely recommend making a reservation. The building is a little sketchy, but that only added to the charm, in my opinion."
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,4,5-Mar-15,One of the best sumiyaki house in Singapore. The fact that it has survived through so many years in fickle Singapore means something. There're two seatings at dinner time 6 or 8pm. Be prepared to eavesdrop or be heard because most of the tables are very close to one another. So leave your secrets outside and enjoy the food ! I love the grilled kama and sweet potato though they aren't cheap. Enjoy!
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,4,21-Sep-12,"Kazu is always crowded so book ahead! The foie gras, which comes as two small pieces on a stick, was a gem. Cheap, too! As was the unagi kabayaki, perhaps the most tender I've had in recent memory.  The kitsune - crispy beancurd skin with meat filling - was surprisingly good. It came with yellow horseradish sauce on the side, which was like a milder cousin of wasabi and went with the kitsune really well. The brown dipping sauce for the yakitori in general also complemented perfectly.  Also, you are cheating yourself if you come here and don't get the yaki imo (sweet potato). Takes nearly an hour to cook but it comes piping hot and soft with a small slice of butter that just melts into the potato.  We thought there were a few items that weren't worth it, though, such as the homemade fish cake at $8 and the grilled sanma (saury) at $32. The fishcake was decent but not particularly impressive. The sanma came a little too charred. Our server explained that it was because of the charcoal grill, but most of the fish skin was blackened -- not a pretty sight."
Kazu Sumiyaki,4.5,18,Japanese,5,23-May-14,"My yelp friends know that I don't usually give 5 stars unless it's excellent, and excellent this place was. I have never been a giant fan of yakitori, but this restaurant really opened my eyes to how great yakitori can really be. Almost every item I had was outstanding, and yes I'm going to recount every item I had. The most memorable dish was an odd one, it's cold cabbage with miso dip. The cabbage was just served at the right temperature, on the cold side, and with the yummy miso sauce, the coldness and crunchiness of the cabbage really came through. We had two orders of it because it was so addictive. Foie gras skewers were great as expected, but hey it's not as challenging to make something like foie gras taste good. The garlic pork meatballs were super yummy, it was just juicy and flavorful but smoky on the outside. The japanese tomato was sweet and yummy, and definitely try the fresh sashimi of the day. I had the best amberjack sashimi I have every had in Singapore, period. The grilled kitsune with minced pea and meat was super delicious, perfectly roasted on the outside and super umami, a must try! Bacon with enoki or avocado are really good as well. I actually wasn't as impressed with the pork belly and wagyu beef as much as I thought I would. The ONLY thing I wasn't impressed with was the bbq onigiri, which was kinda dry and salty. Ooo, and I love that their sake came in glass teapots. Not a cheap place, but definitely worth the price."
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,4,25-May-24,Nice ambience. Decent folks running the place. Save it for special occasions as it's not cheap. Food taste is good.
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,4,23-Aug-23,Quiet quaint spot nearby Andaz. Pricier side of things but the taste ambience and service is good enough to justify. Portions are big so come in pairs and make your tummies happy.
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,2,17-Jun-23,"Went here while on a business trip. Food was a three star, kind of all over. Price was ridiculous. I know Singapore is expensive, but this meal was nowhere near worth the cost.  I ordered the pomelo salad and crab curry. My colleague ordered the crab meat spring rolls and black pepper beef stir fry. Crab Meat Spring Rolls: They were gross. Not sure how else to describe them. Black Pepper beef: Good taste, but the beef pieces were sub par. Gristly and unchewable. We both spit pieces of it out. Simply couldn't eat it. If you're going to charge $36, at least serve some edible meat.  Pomelo salad: Pretty good. It could have have a few chilis in it to give it some spice. Crab Curry: The best thing we had. Highlight of the meal. I'd go back for it if the prices weren't so bad. Very tasty and it had a decent amount of crab. I asked for more spice and it was a medium spice level."
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,5,27-Dec-23,"Absolutely awesome Thai food, a really enjoyable experience. Food came quickly, portions were generous and very, very tasty. Attentive service and nice decor."
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,5,25-Oct-23,"Thai squid and mixed vegetable, well prepared. Excellent service, nice setting, would return!"
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,5,31-Mar-23,"Authentic Thai food, with good taste and quality. Price is also ok, worth it. Good place for dinning"
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,4,25-Oct-17,"The restaurant was located in the row of shophouses which was just above the MRT station from the Downtown line side. The restaurant used to be located in Sembawang 16 years ago, and relocated to its current location in 2013/ 2014. A couple of years ago there was a change of owners with the menu given a makeover.  Looking through the menu, one could not help but notice the uncommon dishes such as Miang Kham and Kra Por Pla Phad Hang.  Yam Som O ($12+ small / $18+ medium) Pomelo Salad pomelo with minced pork, prawns and peanuts I usually avoided pomelo as it usually tasted sour to me. But here it was juicy sweet, with the meat giving it a savoury taste too.  Miang Kham ($12+ small / $18+ medium) Betel Leaf Wrap thai betel leaf with dried shrimps, roasted peanuts, roasted coconut, chilli, lime, ginger and onions with a savoury dip This dish was seldom found in the menu in Thai restaurants in Singapore, as lots of effort was needed to prepare the ingredients such as the finely roasted coconut. It was like having rojak in the mouth with the prawn paste taste, spicy chilli padi, nutty peanuts, fragrant coconut in it.  Khor Moo Kurobuta Yang ($22+) Grilled Kurobuta Pork Collar grilled kurobuta pork collar accompanied with homemade spicy sauce It looked like well charred char siew when served. It was well paired with accompanying tangy sauce.  Gaeng Phed Ped Yang ($17+) Panaeng Red Curry Roast Duck panaeng red curry with roast duck, lychees and pineapples The red curry was not as spicy as expected. It was rich and creamy, which made it nice to go with plain rice, with the juicy pieces of fruit giving it a burst of sweetness.  Hor Mok Talay Khanom Krok ($10+/ 4 pieces, $16+/ 7 pieces) Thai Style Otah on Clayplate mackerel fish mousse with thai herbs served in traditional clayplate The dish was served on cute looking plate which was specially ordered from Thailand. The otah was bouncy and juicy in texture, packed with juicy pieces of seafood in it.  Neau Ribeye Black Angus Yang ($32+) Pan Seared Black Angus Beef Ribeye 220g black angus ribeye beef accompanied with green curry sauce It reminded one of steak served with b¨¦arnaise sauce when served, with the meat sliced into strips for easy handling. On its own, the meat was juicy and tender without overcooked. With the sauce, it was rich and creamy with a green curry aftertaste, which some may felt that it overwhelmed the original taste of the meat.  Kra Por Pla Phad Hang ($14+ small / $20+ medium) Fried Fish Maw with Beansprouts stir fried beansprouts with fish maw and eggs Fish maw was usually used in soup dishes, one seldom saw it in a stir fried dish. Although it was stir fried, it remained soft and spongy.  Khao Phad Nam Liap ($14+ small / $20+ medium) Sawadee Olive Fried Rice stir fried olive rice with chicken strips, dried shrimps, lime and chilli The purplish looking rice was fragrant on its own, served with sliced shallots, cubes of juicy sweet lime, crunchy dried shrimps, chopped spicy chilli padi, crunchy deep fried minced garlic. It was a party in the mouth with spicy, savoury, sweet flavours, plus the different textures.  Khao Phad Talay ($18+ small / $28+ medium) Superior Seafood Fried Rice stir fried rice with crab meat, prawns and conpoy It may looked average, but the crispy fine conpoy provided an extra pop in texture.  Khao Neow Turian ($12+) Mao Shan Wang Durian Sticky Rice premium durian mao shan wang with glutinous rice topped with sesame seeds As Mao Shan Wang was not available, it was replaced with D24 durian puree. The durian puree was rich and creamy with taste more on the sweet and balanced off with the chewy sticky rice.  Khao Neow Ma Muang ($7+) Mango Sticky Rice mango with butterfly pea flower glutinous rice topped with roasted mung beans The mango was chunky and juicy sweet, balanced with the sticky rice, topped with mung beans which gave an extra crunchy texture.  Tup Tim Krob ($6+) Red Ruby water chestnut with jackfruit, coconut flesh and coconut milk There was lots of liao in it, such as the red colored crunchy water chestnut, crunchy sea coconut, soft strips of jackfruit, and coconut flesh. It would be best to have this as soon as it was served as the shaved ice melted rather fast.  Butterfly Pea Flower Tea ($5.50+) The drink was blue in color and served with lime juice by the side. When lime juice was added, the drink changed from blue to purple in color. The drink was more like a lemonade with slight tea taste in the aftertaste."
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,5,22-Jan-17,"I had lunch on a Monday. Not very busy and we were seated immediately. We were in a hurry and they were efficient. My local friend ordered: Olive Fried Rice, Pandan Chicken, Crab Spring Roll, Pomelo Salad.  The salad was incredibly refreshing with a hint of spice. Juicy pomelo and crunchy cashews worked well together.  The Spring roll was hot and had a great crab flavor; it was served with a sweet chili sauce  The Chicken had great flavor and was served with the same sweet chili sauce. The boneless chicken thighs were wrapped in Padan leaves which contributed to the flavor. Chicken thighs were tender and not dry.  Rice was good and came with lime, onion, small fried shrimp, and sweet meat.  We had a refreshing dessert that was like tapioca pudding and shave ice combo with mango, coconut, and red fruit. Delicious!  Service was great. Menu is beautiful. Atmosphere relaxing."
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,5,3-Sep-19,"I'm a captain at a major airline and I've been to Singapore about five times. On my second trip another crew member asked me if I like Thai food. When he heard my enthusiastic response he told me he had a great spot. That was when I was introduced to Sawadee Thai Cuisine. I am officially hooked. On a typical trip I will have at least one lunch and one dinner at this great place.  The crab meat spring rolls, mango salad and stuffed chicken wing appetizers are amazing. I have had the crab meat with red curry sauce, shrimp pad Thai and roasted duck in red curry. All amazing.  I cannot recommend this wonderful restaurant strongly enough. The wait staff are all delightful and attentive. Enjoy!"
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,5,9-Aug-17,"Really good Thai. Fresh spicy intense mixture of spice. Tom Yan is awesome. Great seating, clean, very hospitable."
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,4,27-Oct-19,"This place is special. The focus is on food, but the ambience is very nice. Stall was great.  Crab curry is killer. Especially accompanied by Chang beer."
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,5,2-Apr-18,"This is my 2nd visit to Sawasdee. The first time I visited was in 2015 and I was not a vegan. I actually took a picture of the menu because it was so good. I wanted to make sure that if I ever returned to Singapore, I would return to eat at this restaurant. Fast forward 2 1/2 Years later I returned, but this time as a vegan. I was sooo happy to find out they have a vegan menu! The food was so awesome I returned for a 2nd visit before I left the country!"
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,5,14-Jul-19,My favorite stop in China town. (Last 4 years) Amazing appetizers and pad Thai to die for.  Ice ice cold beer with best rates .  Highly recommend
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,5,9-Jan-20,It was my last night in Singapore and I wanted some Thai food and Thai Iced Tea. Saw the reviews and decided to try the Crab Curry. It was something different I couldn't get at home and it was DELISH! Such a great choice...wish I had more. I ate it without the rice.
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,5,20-Feb-20,"Wonderful place, felt like a local. (Who are all obviously experts on the best Thai food in Singapore I imagine). Seriously, a small gem in a crowded city.  Hard to find with street address - just keep hunting around on the street in that row of small restaurants and cafes. Beautiful understated but modern design style. Food is mind-blowing-ly good. we loves the Tom Kha soup to share. The curries are excellent, and you can ask to adjust the spiciness. Highly recommend the red curry with duck. Overall, authentic Thai in the center of Singapore, at reasonable prices and an elegant atmosphere.  Just go."
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,4,16-Nov-14,"I stumbled upon this place accidentally thanks to google but have been really glad I found it. I have to admit, they're not THE best Thai food you'll find in sg but they are decently quite good. (Yes they've been around 15 years and this is the first time mountain tortoise boy has heard of it)  We've had the green curry, tom yum pla, vermicelli salad, Thai otah, beef with lemongrass, squid, rice crackers and their signature duck curry.  Now where do I start. From the moment we stepped in on the first day, we loved the smell of the food filled the restaurant. That salty tangy smell that comes from all good establishments was ever present in the restaurant, good start!  Looking through the menu, you'd find the familiar dishes across all Thai restaurants in Singapore. Green curry, tom yum soup etc. I'm not going to reveal all the dishes we've tried, but The top 3 dishes.  Our top 3 dishes (in no particular order):  1) Duck Curry Described to be cooked in a rich, thick curry, this curry does not disappointment. The flavours that come screaming through the dish is amazing and if you're looking for a curry with a punch, this is it! It's the kind of rich, Savoury curry you would want to have on a cold rainy day and the flavour of duck certainly shines through, making sure that this dish is elevated with that rich flavour you can only get from a duck. Although there was some inconsistency (the first time we had it it was served with lychees but the 2nd time was with pineapple), it was still a great dish! Fruits with curry?? Eeeew? Trust me. The sweetness of the fruit cuts through the richness beautifully and in fact, elevates the herbs and spices used in the dish.  2) Thai Style Squid There is an option here to have the dish less spicy for the non-chilli fans but the star of this dish is definitely the squid. Cooked to perfection, each bite give you a piece of soft, tender squid bursting with flavour, and that's what we loved about it. The soft tender squid. More often than not, most restaurants tend to murder the squid, cooking it till an almost rubber band texture but not here. Each bit of the squid rings shows you how much care goes into the food here, ensuring that the squid should be perfect.  3) Thai Otah We've seen tons of rendition of this popular Thai dish, some hitting the mark while others tasting like it came out of muar (no insult to muar otah coz I absolutely love it but it isn't Thai). Mixed with fish paste, prawn and what I thought was bamboo shoots, the otah here is delightful. The sweetness of the seafood dancing with your palette while ensuring that the chilli doesn't wreck havoc after, is a fantastic achievement. Just enough chilli is tingle your tongue but not enough to make your food tasteless.  Now with every restaurant, there are some misses and this is no exception. The green curry here is a can miss. Though fragrant, it isn't quite the rich green curry you might hope to get and the rice crackers with creamy chicken, though a good try, doesn't give you that same satisfaction as it would while eating it in Thailand.  A notable mention would go out to their tom yum soup. Close to being one of our favourite, except the fact that it was a tad too spicy. Chilli fans will love it though as the soup really whets your appetite but for the non-chilli eaters, you might find this a tad bit too spicy for your liking.  The fact that we've been here 3 times in 2 weeks goes to show how much we love it. Plus the fact that for the same price as that overly commercialized Thai ""speciality"" restaurant in Singapore, this restaurant certainly gets my vote."
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,5,12-Nov-19,"The only problem that we found : they close between lunch and dinner Service : extremely good Food presentation: impecable Food and portion: very reasonable Taste: extremely delicious and rich, meticulous done Price: not too expensive Inside decor: nice and simple  We went for lunch and time for lunch is limited!!!!"
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,4,9-Jul-19,If the soup is a key to excellence then this establishment held out the promise of authenticity. The dishes were carefully seasoned to appeal to the Thai gourmand The Pad Thai was a bit heavy on sauce. The one disappointing weakness was in the management and service. Table service was provided without smile or comment. It is our hope that Joy and Thai smiles can save this establishment.
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,5,17-Nov-17,"Some of the best Thai food I have ever had. Went with the standbys of papaya salad, Tom kha gai, pad Thai, chicken green curry. All great. Washed down with Tiger beer on tap. Superb dinner."
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,3,2-Nov-14,"Many good reviews made us visit this restaurant. During the evening the tables did indeed fill quickly, speaking for its good reputation. Alas, we were disappointed. The food tasted as good as expected and was arranged nicely. But that's little consolidation when half of what's being brought isn't the food you ordered. We should've taken the hint that we had to repeat every single dish number a minimum of FIVE times during ordering for the lady to get it right. Or at least so we thought. Turned out that still every other dish was noted wrong.  ""We'd like number 13"". ""30?"" ""No, 13"" ""30, ah?"" ""...thirteeeeeen"" ""....thirtyyy?"" ""Look where I'm pointing - 13. 13!"" (Too short sighted, but now confused) ""tree-oh?"" ""Eleven, twelve, thirteen. We'd like number thirteen"" ""Ah, one-tree. Ok"" (writes down 30)  Unfortunately, while funny when reading, experiencing this makes a guest rather uncomfortable. And having to order again during the dinner fills the stomach with waiting upon a half empty table. At the end we wished we had gone somewhere else. We probably won't come back due to this, but we can assure anyone else that the food looks great and tastes great, IF you can manage to get what had wanted."
Sawadee Thai Cuisine,4.5,20,Thai,4,28-Oct-19,"Went there for dinner. Good vegetarian options although they are not listed in the menu. Green curry and mango sticy rice were awesome. Pad Thai was too heavy on the sauce. All in all, a good experience!"
Sakurazaka,4.7,3,Japanese,5,21-Sep-17,"Great shabu shabu place with beautiful decor and good service. The wagyu is well marbled even for the standard level beef. You can up a notch but you better love the really marbled meat.  We ended up ordering extra beef, chicken meat ball and vegetables and ate all of it.  With the price range, I think it should give you a bit more veggies and noodles/rice though."
Sakurazaka,4.7,3,Japanese,5,7-Apr-16,"Step into Sakurazaka at the affluent Greenwood Estate and you would be forgiven for thinking that you are in a restaurant in Japan. Sakurazaka is the new restaurant of Consultant Chef Masashi Horiuchi (also of Shelter in the Woods and Verre Wine Bistro), and it marries Masashi's Japanese heritage and European culinary roots in this Shabu Shabu and Sukiyaki restaurant.  Tuck into one of the 3 Shabu Shabu sets available at Sakurazaka- Pork ($48), Seafood ($54), or Beef ($64). Each set comes with the stone grilled Ishiyaki (Iberico, Seafood, or Wagyu), meats, vegetables, and a dessert (traditional Kakigori) to end off!  It's always fun to be able to participate in your meal. Dip the sizzling grilled meats into the onsen tamago with mild Sukiyaki sauce.  Have your choice of Shabu Shabu in 6 different broths specially created by Chef Masahi. Expect an infusion of European flair in the special soup stock with the rich and tangy Bouillabaisse stock and light Beef Consomm¨¦; or have a taste of Kyushu with the Ago Dashi (dried flying fish stock). Of course, the regular Chicken, Tonkotsu, and even Soya Milk are available. My favorites are the versatile Ago Dashi, and the slightly milky Tonkotsu.  To accompany the prime meats and seafood, 3 special dipping sauces are provided. My favorite is the refreshing and light peppery and very versatile Tamari Ponzu made with miso essence and yuzu. The Shiyo Ponzu is a slightly tart sudachi with seaweed salt. Of course, there's also the rich Goma sauce, with a touch of espelette pepper in this one.  Have the Seafood set with the Bouillabaisse stock for that superb umami flavor at the end. Tiger prawns, white clams, succulent scallop, red snapper, squid, and mussels are in this one. The fresh prawn paste was definitely my favorite of the lot. The minced prawn is mixed with lotus roots, shiitake mushrooms, and shiso.  The Pork set is very enticing with the Kagoshima Shirobuta Pork (loin and belly). This meat is whiter, tender, and slightly sweet; and the fats are translucent with a light chew. Superb!  Beef lovers would go gaga over the Japanese Aomori rice-fed beef (striploin and rib-eye)! The cows are fed with whole rice crop and spring water from Mount Hakkoda for that umami flavor. Lucky them and lucky us!  We enjoyed the meaty texture of the striploin and the ribeye had a good fat to meat ratio as well. I actually prefer the Aomori to the Joshu Wagyu.  I'm not saying that the F1 Joshu Wagyu Beef from Gunma isn't a good option (a la carte option). Just look at that marbling! The fats melted easily with a few swishes in the soup (have the Tonkotsu for that added beef-pork savory flavor), and the huge skirt of beef would break apart if you are not quick enough.  The amount of tender fats was just a little of an overkill for me. The overall mouth feel was a tad fluffy and pillowy. It's just a personal (non) preference #firstworldproblem.  You could also order the generous slices of foie gras for an added indulgence. I still prefer my foie gras seared.  At the end of meal, you can choose to have rice poured into the leftover broth in the pot for Sakurazaka's version of a risotto. Cheese and egg are added to the mix as well and you could then top it up with the side condiments of chili miso, garlic and chili oil, spring onions and sesame. Our version made with the Bouillabaisse stock created an explosion in our mouths. It tasted like a creamy Hae Bee Biam Chili Chwee Kueh almost!  I'm never going anywhere else for Sukiyaki after being spoilt by Chef Masashi. The F1 Wagyu-Holstein cross-breed beef in the Sukiyaki set has a very good marbling and is considered the best Wagyu cross-breed.  The meat and vegetables are first cooked in a pan, followed by the addition of broth and condiments such as soy sauce, sugar and mirin. Chef Masashi had refined the sukiyaki sauce and made it less sweet to suit the local palate and we thought he nailed the balance. The recommended sauces are the ponzu, and sesame sauce. And obviously there's a raw egg in the mix too.  Rounding off the meal is the Kakigori, made of finely shaved ice, flavored with syrup and condensed milk - similar to patbingsu, haluhalo, and ice kachang. Ujikintoki Green Tea is obviously a crowd pleaser and there's an intense green tea ice cream hidden inside. Another refreshing one that we enjoyed is the Port Wine Kakigori with port wine jelly and blood orange.  I'm definitely a fan of Sakurazaka. I think this is almost the only reason for me to make the trek down to Bukit Timah. Individual sets are available now so you can satisfy your craving even if no one else wants to (are you kidding me)!"
Sakurazaka,4.7,3,Japanese,4,19-Jul-16,"Four words: Hokkaido milk shaved ice. I'd go back for the dessert alone. Came here for a birthday dinner, we were about twenty. The restaurant is nicely decorated. Simple, elegant with a Japanese flair and sakura blossoms on the ceiling for obvious reasons. The staff were very accommodating when we added extra table settings, chairs, drinks and changed orders multiple times.  You have the option of ordering three different shabu-shabu menus: pork, seafood or beef, from cheapest to most expensive respectively. I had the seafood (approx S$55). All menus come with an appetizer of sliced marinated Wagyu beef you personally set on the hot stone served with it. Pretty darn good. The rest is typically shabu-shabu style. The seafood was fresh and the portions adequate. Menu includes a shaved ice dessert and you have the option of choosing between Hokkaido milk, Green tea red bean and mango. Was a tough one. Hokkaido milk comes with malt milk candy and is just the right amount of sweet. I like this spot. Understated and plain good."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,30-Sep-23,This was our first meal in Singapore after landing on UA1 and dropping our bags off at our hotel.  No line compared to the last visit so we got seated quickly at the same table.  Ordering was done online and spaced out over time so we got our dim sum hot and when we were ready for the next set.  For us the ha gau and shrimp rolls were better than the pork dishes. The fried puffs were savory and became one of our favorites.  After finishing our meal we paid at the cashier. No credit cards.  If pressed for time they have a take away counter outside of the restaurant.
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,23-Feb-23,"Our original plan was to visit after a night out drinking since it's open late but we ended up just eating a late dinner. And even though we visited around 9PM, the wait was still about 30 minutes long. Wait times are based on your group size, which places you into different queues. Luckily, the restaurant uses an online ordering system so we were able to pick everything we wanted prior to getting seated. Workers speak Mandarin, Cantonese, and some English.  Once seated, the food came out so fast. I mean we really had to start clearing out the plates to make room for more. The food tasted fresh, quality was great...but I wasn't really surprised by that since I pretty much expected dim sum to be delicious in Singapore. The menu is really extensive and, as a group of 10, were able to order almost everything to try. Everything is so much cheaper here compared to the States so we went overboard with ordering.  If you don't want to wait for a table, there's a section of the store where you can order to-go. Also a great option for snacks while waiting for your table!  Cash only!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,18-Jan-23,"Hearing late night Dim Sum was an option here immediately caught my attention and I knew I wanted it at least once during our trip to Singapore. We ended up finding a night where it wasn't too late, around 9pm when we finally got a chance to visit Swee Choon Tim Sum.  - SERVICE/ENVIRONMENT - Fairly big restaurant, although even at 9pm it's quite packed. Be prepared to wait, especially if you have a large party like we did (10 people!). While you wait, you're able to order ahead of time through their online ordering system! So once you are seated, they attribute your order to your table, and service is FAST. Literally once we sat down and had put in our order, it didn't take more than 5 minutes for the first plate to come to our table, and the rest waterfalled in one by one after that!  - FOOD - Although fast in service, the quality of the food doesn't go down! Everything was very well made, not overcooked or undercooked, not too salty or not flavored enough. We got almost the entire menu with our group size, so we were able to try a little bit of everything!  Highlights: - Shrimp Cheung Fun: super silky rice rolls! - Porridge: actually very flavorful! - Sweet Potato Custard Buns/Salted Egg Custard Buns  - OVERALL - I don't think you usually get a chance to eat Dim Sum so late in the night, so Swee Choon Tim Sum is definitely a gem in that case. Pair it with the extensive menu items and the quality of food, and you've got yourself a great dining spot to go to whenever in Singapore."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,26-Nov-23,"Acceptable dim sum at a decent price point.  The dim sum was ordered online using a QR code and if you knew what you wanted, the food can come within 5-10 min. after submitted. The plates were small but affordable.  We spent under 40 SGD for 2 people for the following:  2 orders of siu mai (4 pieces total) 2 orders of har gow (4 pieces total) 1 order of rice noodle roll with char siu 1 order of potstickers (fried pork dumplings) 1 order of mixed vegetables (cabbage and carrot mix) 1 order of fried tofu skin roll (2 pieces) 1 order of tea for 1 1 order of warm water for 1 1 order of ice water for 1  I noticed that many of the customers ordered noodle soups...  The restaurant also has a take-out window where you can order dim sum to go.  This dim sum restaurant also had an outlet in Terminal 2 of Changi, so we were able to have dim sum for breakfast.  The dim sum was not fancy like the other dim sum restaurant we tried, but considering the quality of the food and the price point, it is worth having dim sum there."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,14-Feb-23,"Headed to this restaurant in Little India based off a tip from the hotel. One of the only places I have seen so far in Singapore with a long queue. Ordering is all via QR code and keep an eye out for the robot cruising around the dining area. Based on the chef recommendations, we ordered the chicken with rice, steamed dumplings, pancake rolls, hot and sour soup, and shrimp fried rice. The chicken and rice was so good I forgot to take a photo. Only letdown was the shrimp fried rice which was lacking flavor and hiding shrimp. Overall, a great stop!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,11-Aug-20,"I finally get to taste the dim sum that everyone talks about. Was a small restaurant below old shophouses and slowly it began its expansion, occupying all the ground floor units of all the next door buildings.  Had to wait about 30 mins for a table. I don't mind with the reputation of the food that I was about to taste.  Waiting for a table means inputing the number of people in your party, the cell number of your phone for the automated system to assign you a table. Ordering is also automated. You scan a QR code and order to your hearts content. The dishes arrived fast and furious. Service is fast.  The dim sum was typical Cantonese style. They had special wontons in spicy sauce or wine, the usual har gow, sui mai, pows, egg tarts, chicken feet, Pork cubes. Egg tarts, a side of chicken cooked in spicy sauce. The list is quite long.  Overall a delight to those who love dim sum. Oh, did I mention, of all the 5 dining halls, only one is naturally ventilated. Prey hard you get the ac ones."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,26-Feb-23,"Has large variety of what a dim sum have. The order was fast with la mian making behind make the whole place look very authentic. However, the long queue is the down side."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,3,7-Dec-19,"I saw great reviews about this dim sum restaurant so I decided to give them a try. However, it was over rated. We got there early so we didn't have to queue in line. It was great, we were seated right after they opened at 1100. I was impressed that this place was pretty tech savvy for a dim sum restaurant. We scanned a QR code to order on the smartphone. Typically, I'm used to picking my dim sum from a cart or ordering on a piece of paper.  I'm giving them three stars because none of our dishes came out hot. All of the food that came out was either warm or cold (again, the dishes should have been hot). I was pretty disappointed."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,25-Mar-19,"Very popular dim sum place. They have three stores next to each other which they open based on demand. We arrived right after 11 am when they were opening and had no trouble finding a spot to sit.  We ordered an array of dim sum plates which were good and pretty standard but tasty and some jasmine tea to go along with it. My favorites were the dumplings and the buns although I have no idea what they were filled with, we just ordered based on the pictures on the menu, which was really helpful. The spicy items are really spice, so be careful when ordering!  No frills cheap fast food."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,14-May-19,"One of my favorite late night eats when I'm in Singapore.  Expect a long wait -- although they've expanded to encompass three different rooms now. One of my favorites is their unique Mee sua kueh which is a pan fried mee sua noodle that looks like carrot/turnip cake. I like to drizzle the spicy wanton sauce on it before eating. Yum!  Service isn't the best, but then again you come for the good food and not 5 star service treatment."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,3-Mar-17,"The dimsum of Swee Choon can easily stand next to the more upscale versions in town and now they are open for lunch too plus they still serve the late night crowds!  Their custard buns are hands down the best version I had throughout Singapore and one of the reasons to come back. Other things I like include:Xiao Long Bao, Egg tarts, Har Kau,...  The no-nonsense efficient style of the restaurant makes me forgiving for the lack of contact between the servers and the customers and unlike at other Chinese restaurants in town, I've never been given even as much as an eye twitch that I don't speak Chinese.  Love it!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,3,2-Mar-20,"Stopped by here when I visited Little India. Flavors are quite good and filling without it being overwhelmingly heavy.  Also, *CASH ONLY*  They close for a few hours to prep for dinner. I really wanted to try a few dishes on their dinner menu but never got a chance to go back. I can imagine this being a good place for a late night grub. Worth visiting and giving a try if you're in the area!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,7-Dec-18,"This is my favorite supper haunt. Every time I come here, I end up ordering about half of the stuff on the menu. I know there are better quality dim sum out there, but none can beat the variety. Do not be intimidated by the line. Yes there's always a discouraging queue of people waiting on the roadside, but it is also moves fast since they have sooo many tables. A few of my favorites are: - Liu sha bao (salted egg yolk bao) - Steamed pork ribs - Chee chong fun with prawn / charsiew - Mee suah kueh - Beancurd chicken roll - Shredded dried beancurd parsley  You can ask for chili oil and they'll give it to you generously."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,20-Oct-19,"I had a mouthgasm from eating here. Everything was so good!  Tips: Bring cash cause they don't accept credit cards. Also, they're closed on Tuesday."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,18-Dec-17,Portuguese egg tart. Not too sweet. Flaky layers of crust. One of the best. Bao with creamy inside. Very nice while hot. Xiao Long Bao. Soup is nice. Juicy meat on the inside. Sticky rice with chicken. Carrot cake. Crispy edges. Late night eats. Just say yes.
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,26-Jan-18,"24 hour dim sum place, plenty of seating, fast service. Good variety of dim sum dishes offered. Would recommend if you're in this area and want a quick bite"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,17-Jun-18,"Pretty solid dim sum place with a variety of dishes. My favorites were the pork ribs, the big bao, and the mango dessert. They have a ton of options so you can satisfy any picky person."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,2,21-Aug-18,"I'm a big fan of dim sum! I have tried a lot in different country. The line is really fast, there are a lot of place inside, with AC.  About the food, Siu Mai is Ok, Ha kao has two big shrimps inside, they come by 2 pieces. Xiao long bao, skin soft but the soup wasn't there, just a little bit.., prawn chee cheong fun only for dinner (...).  For the rest ( fried dim sum and desert ) were just Ok. So I won't come back for sure.  There are many better dim sum restaurant in Singapore. Go there only if all the others dim sum are close (they open all night)."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,25-Apr-18,"My go-to-spot for dim sum in Singapore. You can find most of your typical dim sum dishes (siew Mai, har gao, rice rolls, BBQ pork buns, etc) plus more, such as soup dumplings. You have to also try the green onion pancake, as well as the chili wontons!  A filling meal for two ran us about $30 SGD, which is a steal. Only reason why I gave Swee Choon 4 stars is because the auntie at the the counter was annoyed when I told her I didn't eat the appetizers they put on the table, which we knew they were going to charge us for. If you're not going to eat the appetizers, be sure to tell the waitress to take it away or else they'll charge you for it.  Aside from this, I think swee choon is great for the money if you're looking for dim sum in Singapore."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,3,24-Jul-19,"Honestly, we were so excited to get some dim sum at Singapore and the place seemed to have pretty good reviews, but it really wasn't anything special. We ordered a whole bunch of stuff and nothing really stood out. For going to a lot of dim sum places, this place was subpar at best :/ They also do this thing in a lot of Singapore restaurants where they charge you for hand towels and tap water. They put the towel on our table for use but then, we realized after that you get charged and they don't really specify that."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,30-Aug-19,"The dim sum I had from here during my summer in sg has made me unable to enjoy any other dim sum since. My friends and I came every chance we could and it especially hit the spot after clubbing, since it's known for being open till 6am. Over a year later, we still reminisce about the salted egg yolk custard buns, which are h e a v e n. I also highly recommend the rice rolls w/ char siew, pig trotters and (of course) the xiao long bao, but everything else tasted good too (except i would skip the egg tarts and go to tai cheong for those). Swee choon is will forever have a piece of my heart. Try at your own risk, you may never be able to eat average dim sum again."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,14-Feb-19,Beancurd roll - 3.5 stars Bit too salty. Pretty sure there's prawn or meat inside...  Fried pumpkin with custard - 4 stars It's Á÷É³ inside. Not sure how I feel about it but the texture was great.  Passion fruit juice ($3.50) - 4 stars
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,3,26-Mar-18,"This was the last stop of our 3-part brunch and by the time we arrived, we were pretty much eating for sport. We ordered a few savory and a few sweet dim sum dishes and tried our best to eat everything.  The Portuguese Egg Tart was satisfying as was the Salted Egg Yolk Custard Bun. Although the sweet items were good, the savory ones were just ok.  I'm kind of surprised by the number of great reviews for this place. Compared to dim sum in Hong Kong or even in the US, this wasn't that impressive. Save your precious stomach space for something more special."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,23-Feb-16,"I felt this place was like a 3.5 but I decided to push it to a 4 for a few reasons:  1) Late night dim sum. There aren't a lot of choices. 2) Good organised queuing system. We came around 8pm on Sunday and we actually got seats immediately despite the queue coz we were only 2 and ok to sit in the alley at the back. 3) Pleasant service from the 2 or 3 different guys who served us.  What I ate: 1) fried garlic dou miao for 8 dollars. Worth it! 2) char siew bao - love the filling, but the bao skin was a bit too chewy. Actually all their bao fillings were good! We had also the lotus bao, the custard bao (nice molten without being too liquidy ie my friend who likes custardy type and I who like molten were both quite happy) 3) cheong fan - no filling but we had a craving having missed it recently at pek kio when it was closed for CNY and wow nice surprise. So soft and smooth! Looks simple but all comfort in the mouth. This was one of our favourite items. 4) Xiao Long Bao - Came quickly and was surprisingly good. The skin was quite thin, lots of juices. A bit lighter and finer tasting rather than lipsmacking greasy but very tasty. 5) Egg tart - yum. Smooth light texture for the filling, quite sweet though. Good sized.  Tip: Do not order lemon tea unless you want the canned Seasons one. I was hoping for homemade...  A few other comments: I haven't been here in many many years. There's lots of choices on the menu and also cooked dishes for variety. Streetside parking around but need to be patient. Old school tea served in a teapot with a cup that you can sterilize in the saucer of hot water. My expat friend who has lived in Singapore many years was not sure what to do with the hot water so I had to explain. Haha nice touch."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,18-Jun-16,"Good menu with lots of options. Has enough for you to find something you like that keeps you coming back (like yours truly), or to keep you coming back to try new things.  The service plays it fast and loose and everything from seating to ordering, serving to payment moves quite quickly. No worries if you can't speak a lick of anything other than English, as writing on order forms, pointing and gestures usually end with the desired result.  The dim sum is quite good, and most of the items are enjoyable. It's an evening and all night place that is closed on Tuesdays (learned that the hard way)."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,3-Dec-15,"My go-to place for dim sum at 2am!  Order the: fried mee sua cake (carrot cake made out of mee sua), the peitan porridge, xiao long bao, siew mai, har gow, even the sauteed veggies.  I think u cant go wrong with most of its dim sum items EXCEPT for the chee cheong fun. That made me sad  Havent tried the handmade noodles yet; thats next on my list.  It can get very busy on the weekends, with long queues snaking outside, but there is a takeout window which moves pretty fast."

Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,2-Aug-20,"Best Dim Sum I've had in Singapore so far. Variety of dumplings, online ordering and organized seating"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,22-Jul-18,Great food! Great service! Good for expats The picture menu helped. You need cash or a card that's used in Singapore to pay. Luckily there's a ATM across the street. We had fun and will go back when in town again.
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,19-Apr-14,"I wouldn't call this a dimsum place per se, but a place that serves dimsum items and some Chinese food.  Favorites: Custard bun Chicken feet Shanghai wonton soup **Prawn and banana fritter**  The rest of the items are palatable/acceptable, and order whatever you want. I've had a few late nights here with a girlfriend, and we've never gone over $35 for two people. Have I mentioned the best part is that it opens till dawn?"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,24-Apr-15,"I came here a while ago so I know this definitely needs a revisit and a review but all I can say is from past experience I highly recommend this place because, it just wasn't what I expected. I love how its open late at night, I love the casual ambience and the food was delicious.  I came in with around 12 people and were accommodated very nicely - we played games, we ate good food, what more is there to love? ALSO - THE MOST CRUCIAL POINT.  Up to that very moment in time I was convinced that red bean wasn't for me. After tucking into their red bean pancakes (and tuck in I did) I literally made a 180 degree turn and now can't get enough of red bean desserts! They are so so delicious, we had to order more! I would go back just for that. In fact I'm planning to make a massive trip with my sister and cousins the next time I am over.  Looking forward to it already!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,16-Nov-19,"If you want classic dim sum dishes or Chinese main dishes Swee Choon is a must try!!!!!! Extremely well known for the dim sum, Swee Choon has all your favourite dim sum dishes, but have elevated the food to be more refined and more delicious!!!!! A definite must try is their salty egg yolk bun!!!!! The bun is so light and fluffy, while the egg yolk is so creamy and oozes out of the bun!!!!! The egg yolk also is so flavourful and compliments the soft bun so well!!!! Another must try is the fried taro dumplings filled with delicious meat!!!!! These taro dumplings are fried to perfection and are much larger than what you normally find in other restaurants!!!! They also serve fried turnip cake and fried red bean crepes!!!!! If you want a dish with more substance or bigger portions they also have rice and noodles dishes!!!! Highly recommend their Ho Fun, which is a rice noodle dish with an egg sauce!!!!! The Ho Fun is so flavourful and also comes with veggies and seafood!!!! This place is a must try for both dim sum and normal Chinese dishes!!!!!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,2-Nov-19,"Great food and superior prices. Don't worry about the long line out front they move quickly. You use your phone for ordering so the food comes quickly but maybe a little out of sequence. We had the crispy fried pork, saut¨¦ed long beans with minced pork and the Sichuan chili oil wonton. I have to say all the items were the best I have ever had. Finished the meal off with chilled cocoanut pudding, for a great finish."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,8-Aug-16,"Known for its late-night dim sum. Quite a fan. Our group was seated immediately as we were willing to rough it outside with their alleyway seating instead of waiting for a table inside (which is air-conditioned). It wasn't too unbearable outside; a tad bit warm, but definitely worth saving 20-30 minutes of time waiting.  Service was fine. They had a button on the table you can press and a waiter will come over pretty much instantly. Very efficient this way.  The food was very good. One of the better dim sum places I've had. I think this would be the first time I've had dim sum in the evening. You won't be disappointed."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,5-May-17,"Maybe it isnt the BEST dim sum in singapore but i only had once chance to eat and it was CRACK. It stays open late night and has the bomb dim sum full of locals eating. We ordered like 10 things for 25 bucks. The soup dumpings, xiao long bao, hot and sour soup were amazing!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,7-Sep-12,"I've gotta say, Swee Choon is a great place for a drunken post-party supper. Especially if you get a seat at the tables in the dark little alleyway behind the restaurant. It's so shady, it has a specific charm to it.  I prefer sitting outdoors anyway. Even though there's airconditioning inside, the fluorescent lights are a pet peeve of mine, and the floors are oily.  Service is curt and efficient, but don't expect a smile. They guys working here are so busy they don't have time for niceties. They shout out orders and commands into a walkie talkie, striding about busily, serving and clearing plates and taking orders at the same time.  I am honestly quite impressed at their chaotic system. Somehow, it works.  Be sure to come early if you're coming for dinner or an early supper. It gets pretty full up! The dimsum here is affordable and of decent quality. It is also served in small portions, so couples can come here to eat by themselves too.  I especially like thei Liu Sha Bao - it's bun with some kind of custardy salted egg filling. The golden filling oozes out of the steaming bun as you bite into it. Their Char siew buns are also pretty good, with a fluffy, light bun, and tasty, meaty fillings. Another thing I like to order is the char siew pastry. The pastry is light and buttery, with sesame seeds sprinkled in top. Super tasty.  The har gow and siew mais are pretty good as well, but the century egg porridge was far too bland and uninspiring. The non dim sum dishes are alright as well, so don't be too worried about ordering different things to try!  Another dish that deserves special mention is the Orni (yam paste). It comes with pumpkin and gingko nuts... and it's divine! Served hot in an individual bowl, it's a generous portion for one person. It's fresh and fragrant, with a thick and consistent texture. I love that it's not too sweet as well.  Love it here, will always come back for more dimsum in a dark dingy alley. Parking here is tedious business - only on the street. And this ebing Little India, people are walking around everywhere, and you also have road works to contend with. Good luck!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,27-Jun-14,"This was my first visit to this place and as a tourist to this country I think Swee Choon Tim sums are the best. Their menu is so different and the food comes to your table piping hot. It's fresh and so authentic that if I were to live in Singapore, I'd visit this place every fortnight.  I was very luck to have been taken to this place by two locals and they showed me exactly how to eat each dish. As you all know dim sums are better enjoyed in a bigger group, so one can try more varieties.  However if you are visiting Singapore and are clueless about which place to eat dim sums at, look no further. At peak hrs this place does get crowded and wait times can go upto about an hour or so."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,3,5-Nov-15,"Don't expect refined food and you'd be enjoying yourself. The food is generally decent and what I think Swee Choon has going for her is: 1. Cheap affordable pricing 2. Decent variety 3. Efficient dining experience 4. Supper spot!  No 4 is probably why most people are here. Although there are some good competition around the area (Da Lian noodles across the street and Tim Ho Wan at lavender and both opens 24 hours), Swee Choon definitely has their own following.  My favorite is also the fried mee suah, which most yelpers has pointed out. I have never seen this dish anywhere else. Savory rice noodles pan fried. It is certainly interesting.  Everything else on the menu you can probably find a better version elsewhere."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,13-May-14,"The best place for ""Dim Sum"" and other Chinese food. Absolutely delicious and its definitely worth the money.  Do not know where to go for supper? I would definitely recommend this restaurant which is conveniently located along Bendemeer Road.  Very suitable for dinner gathering with large group, only problem is its difficult to find parking and also long queues during meal times and weekends!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,8-Nov-15,"Cheap and cheerful dim sum with character! Think din tai fung crossed with a nice hawker centre.  Their Xiao Long Bao (soupy dumplings) are fantastic and a must try, and the wanton dumplings with the chilli oil is also a favourite. Only downside is there are no alcoholic drinks on the menu :("
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,12-Nov-17,"There are a really no words to describe the eating here! Best best dim sum ever. Jesus it's good. Hole in the wall place, lined up, wait, you will not regret waiting for this unbelievable eating experience. It's fast pace, loud and very organized. The turn over is huge, but not rushed. I went twice when I was In Singapore - don't let this pass you by!!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,3,23-Jan-13,"This is the place to go to for late night dim sum. Instead of the usual morning dim sum, Swee Choon opens only at night and serves dim sum besides noodles and dumplings and other dishes.  The food is pretty much average. This is not the place for fine details or quality food. It is just a normal place with food which will suit most. The highlight for me, besides the opening hours, is the liu sha bao (custard bun) which is done pretty well. Eat it while it is hot and you will get the soft custard filling flowing out of the soft bun.  Another dish which is not commonly found is the mee sua kueh. It is similar to fried carrot cake, except it is made of mee sua. Strands of mee sua are fried till crispy. It is good though oily. You will need to share this as the grease can make it a bit heavy on the stomach.  The har cheong gai (prawn paste fried chicken wings) is pretty good too. Don't bother ordering the bean curd. It is pricey at $2 or more and is very average. You are better off having bean curd somewhere else. The other dishes we ordered are not that memorable at all."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,8-May-19,"SUPERB! this is honestly our go-to place, really nice tim sum and cheap too compared to the prices outside. Def our favourite place."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,1,15-Mar-19,"Pros: Overnight Hours Cheap Fast  Cons: Food is not delicious  This location is a place frequented by after-party drunkards, may get noisy. Food is very cheap, but only mediocre."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,2,26-Jul-12,"Swee choon's an OK place for late night supper with friends or family. Although the dim sum variety here is extensive, I feel that taste-wise, it isn't as good as other dim sum supper places like Crystal Jade at Holland Village. Their staff service is pretty bad too. One of the waiters got pretty pissed and went away in a huff when we asked for our drinks to be served after ~10 mins of waiting.  I'd say a good place to hangout for dinner/ supper/ early breakfast if you are just looking to fill your tummy.  Do not try: pumpkin pastry (see picture)  Do try: fried carrot cake"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,17-Jul-15,"I love Swee Choon. It's affordable and delicious, with a no-frills get super efficient style that doesn't waste time on pretensions and just gets you your food!  My favourites are the carrot cake and the pan-fried dumplings; I have to get those every time.  Swee Choon does get very crowded in the evenings; be prepared to take a number and wait! It's a smooth system, though: you get your number texted to your phone and you can keep track of how long your wait is."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,3,1-Dec-15,"Dim sum madnessssssss.  -order the Liu Da bao -order the congee -order what other tables are ordering. -order the horfun if you wanna prove me wrong.Mine severely lack the nice wok fragrance and needed more seasoning.  One time, I wasn't feeling too good and had watercress soup. It wasn't too bad."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,8-Dec-15,Quaint little dim sum store near little india! Me and my friends ordered some dishes like the legendary xiao long bao and the typical siewmai. The dishes tasted almost flawless and is honestly one of the best dim sum around Singapore! The only downside is the price and the seating. The prices are quite expensive and the seating is quite limited due to the crowd. Highly recommend! Xiao long bao- 9.5/10
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,13-Jul-15,"The best dim sum in the city! Although the queue is crazy, but the waiting time is quite short tbh. Food is great, place is oldies but I was amazed by the way they use tech to assist their work. Very recommended place for dim sum lover."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,19-Jun-15,"The most affordable+good variety of dim sum in singapore. And best part is that it opens throughout the night and is a very pleasant option when the weather is a bit cooler.  Good service, nice prices and some unique stuff as well. I liked the udon in onion oil.. nice flavour and goes well with the clean soup. I am a regular.. wish they had a couple of more branches but not in malls and only in shophouses."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,28-Apr-18,A friend brought us here. Go for it if you want some dimsum:) I think it is good for late night suppers
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,23-Mar-18,"Pretty much the go-to place for late night dim sum.  Never fail to get the fried mee sua kueh and the custard buns when I'm here.  Quick service, decent prices, air-con seating (mostly). Gets really crowded on weekend nights though!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,14-Sep-12,"This place has the ambience of a poorly maintained public restroom, but my wife and I are regulars here anyway. I don't think their dim sum is anything special, despite the name, but their northern-style dumplings and hand-made noodles are very good. For me, the star dish is their spicy chili wontons. The dumpling skins are thin and silky, they're generously filled with juicy pork, and the sauce is a perfect mix of black vinegar, soy, and chili.  Also, there's this one waiter who runs around the place like a madman, yelling ""Beep! Beep!"" to let people know he's coming through. Even when there's no one in his way."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,1,2-Dec-15,Food served in small portion and pricey. Taste is just average. Don't understand what draws people here. Presentation of food is bad too. Servers are not friendly and attentive.
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,13-Sep-13,"Swee Choon is kinda famous for the Mee Suah Kueh (2 for $2), which is a deep fried rice cake that is wrapped in a salty rice vermicelli. But that has never been my favorite. I wasn't all too impressed with the food the first time i went and i was glad that i returned with my food kakis after a long hiatus. Since every dish was pretty small, that allowed us to order up a storm even at 3 in the morning. Oh and this was after i had my Peanut Butter French toast and Hazelnut latte at midnight.  We had the Salted Egg Yolk Custard Bun (3 for $3.60) which wasn't all too bad. I liked the Sichuan Chili Oil Wanton (4 for $4) which had the right amount of spice and vinegar. The Steamed Pork Ribs ($2.50) were also tender and well marinated.  I rather liked the pan fried carrot cake (2 pieces for $2) that had the right chunks of radish and dried shrimps. No Chee Cheong Fun for me because it is the regular kind and not the steamed Cantonese sort. Yes i'm picky that way.  You MUST order the Fried Golden Tofu ($3.50) that is lightly crusted on the outside and seasoned with pepper and salt. The silky texture is simply amazing. The steamed beancurd roll in oyster sauce ($3.20) is also very good.  I'll definitely be heading back if hunger pangs strike in the middle of the night!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,19-Dec-17,Reasonably priced dim sum. Able to accommodate alot of people. Can get noisy. It's OK when you're seated indoors. But outdoors at the back can be really gross due to the drains and lack of shelter.
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,4-Apr-14,"I can't believe I've never heard of this place till recently! A good friend of mine is a fan, and has been coming here and raving about their dimsum for ages, so it was only natural that we would end up coming here eventually.  Apparently queues are a common sight to behold but we were here at 10pm on a weekday night and there was none!  Loved their steamed custard buns, xiao long bao and chao shou (Sichuan wontons in chili oil).  The custard buns came at just the right temperature, and were packed with the divine yellow gravy which was viscous and oozed out just barely as we bit into it. (In comparison to a recent version at another shop where it was so watery and hot that the both of us got scalded).  They were generous with the meat in the xiao long bao, and it was flavorful and I'd dare say comparable to the ones at Crystal Jade. Would have had more of this if not for the limited stomach space!  The chao shou came lying in a very tasty chili oil mix and were more spicy than other ones I've tried. It was good but could have been better. It came in a shallow dish, making it quite difficult to scoop up sufficient amounts of the chili oil to go with my wontons. Would have preferred to ladle some more into my spoon for that additional kick as I was eating it. Perhaps next time I'll ask for some extra oil on the side.  Dessert was mehhhh. Had the yang zhi gan lu (mango/pomelo dessert) and I've had better.  Dinner came up to be about $25 for 2! Affordable and good- I'm definitely going to return someday!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,3,22-Dec-13,"It's Swee Choon Tim Sum, I dont think I need to introduce it much except the fact that it used to be just one unit, non-airconditioned and a little raw and dirty...which has it's natural draw of a very authentic chinese late night dim sum place. Though it small and slightly rundown, it was usually packed cos the food is good.  Lo and behold, a few years down the road, Swee Choon Tim Sum has expanded across 3 - 4 units with 2 of them air-conditioned. Despite the expansion, it's still packed and please do not expect to get a seat straight away cos you will definitely still need to wait to get a table, it's just a matter of, how long is that waiting time.  Classic dim sum menu, the hargao (steamed prawn dumplings) and siew mais (steam pork dumplings) are really not that great, but, you gotta try their Salted Yolk Custard bun. For the uninitiated, there is a way of consuming these salted yolk custard buns that will NOT cause a mess or an unexpected explosion of hot buttery custard all over you. To prevent unnecessary embarrassment, remember, you ""attack"" this heavenly bun from the bottom. Slowly peel off the paper cup base, and slowly bite into the bun. Savour each drop of creamy salted custard before taking another bite.  The rave seem to all be abt this custard bun and really that's pretty much about it for me. I dunno why people flock here all the time cos the parking is terrible (not many parking lots around) and the food is only average but it still one of the few places that I will always go for late night dim sum craving. What a sucker I am!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,8-Oct-12,"You can't always have it all and Swee Choon definitely does not have decor AND good food. But as long as you come for the food and not the furnishings, you'll be fine.  Swee Choon's hours (6 pm - 4 am) and menu (dim sum and lots of dumpling types of fare) are as good at 2 am as they are at 8 pm. They have typical dim sum dishes like shu mai and those egg yolk custard buns, but they are mediocre here and the selection isn't extensive (e.g. only plain cheong fun is offered here).  But they brought in some Shanghai trained chefs who turn out hand-made noodles and different meat filled pockets of doughy goodness (xiao long bao, spicy wanton) with a deft hand. I wish they had a few more meat or vegetable dishes. But if I can only order dan dan mian and delicate, tender spicy wanton, I'll still be happy and full."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,6-Aug-12,"Recommended by a close chef friend of mine who insisted I should give a try, I finally made my way down to Swee Choon after a night of partying and was left impressed.  One of the few places to be open past 3am, it's quite common to see long queues and full houses on Wednesdays and throughout the weekend. In fact, its more of a nightspot than other usual tim sum places that open in the morning (they close at 10am!). The service staff are attentive and quick, and food is served within 10minutes of ordering, regardless of the crowd.  Decor is kept relatively simple and tables are well spaced, allowing for comfort while eating, though it can get a little noisy. So far, the fried mee suah, liu sha bao, prawn rolls and chee cheong fun are the dishes that I find myself repeating whenever I'm there."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,1,18-Apr-15,Definitely overrated dim sum and would not recommend to friends. The presentation of the food is bad and the taste is not that good as people mentioned. Maybe we ordered the wrong food...
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,28-Jun-19,Great place for dim sum in singapore. Their shrimp dumplings are still the best I've ever had. thin skin with a bunch of shrimp inside. Get the deep fried banana and shrimp dumpling -- sound weird but actually very nice.
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,29-May-17,The egg tart and char siew bau are great. It is nice to have these Tim sum for ending the day. You can see many people sitting there and make you feel it is still early in the evening. It is not expensive and you can feed your stomach easily. Try it especially when you stay near to this restaurant.
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,24-Mar-19,"Great soup dumplings and noodles. The only negative thing about the place is a long wait, but we did the take away, food was still amazing."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,17-Jul-12,"This is my favorite place to go to for Dim Sum. When I'm bored at night, I find opportunities to go for a walk at Mustafa's. Along the street was where I found Swee Choon Tim Sum; brightly lit signboards on the outside + huge crowds of patrons queuing outside = definite must try!  My favorite's the golden tofu cubes top with a little pork floss, these are to die for! Their soup dumplings and pan-fried dumplings are my bf's favorites. If you are a congee lover, you won't want to miss SC's century egg congee. Yummmm!  If you hate queuing, here's a good hack: go behind the restaurant and volunteer to sit at the back alley. You get good food fast and sitting in the back alley gives a more casual feel to the dim sum experience.  Opening hours are weird here, they open everyday (except tues) from 6pm until 10am. Fantastic for the owls in you."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,3,12-Aug-12,"Swee Choon Dim Sumis one of those places my local friends always talk about and recommend, though after a few visits, I cant see what all the fuss is about. That's not putting the place done, I just have had better dim sum in other parts of Singapore and even in Melbourne.  There's always a queue out the front, but walk through the store and sit out the back is your best bet for a table. While you go without aircon, and any real artificial light, it adds to that real SE Asia dining feel. Be warned though, if you don't like rates or mice I'd give the back tables a skip, as they will often be running around the gutters and under tables in the dark!!! Food is decent while not spectacularly good, extensive choices is a plus, drunken chicken is fantastic!! Good place to hang out for late night dim sum!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,24-Aug-12,"This is a wonderful place to get good quality dim sum at weird hours. You can choose to sit indoors which is airconditioned, or outdoors if you are a smoker. I love their Har Gao (prawn shrimp dumpling - comes in pairs) as well as their custard buns - which comes in thress. Their chee cheong fun is smooth and thin, not the typical machine processed kind which is laden with flour. Do not forget to try their special fried red bean pancake. They also serve mango sago dessert, and a plethora of drinks such as barley, ice grass jelly and more. For a group of four, if you eat to your fill, it probably will cost about $10 per pax."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,8-Apr-16,Great cheap food with no frills! Be prepared to wait at busy times it's definitely worth it
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,25-Jan-19,"Amazing great quality dim sum. Love the salted egg buns, Dan Dan noodles and most of the items in the menu. Open all night, worth waiting in line. It's been there forever and is pretty cheap. Highly recommend it."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,16-Apr-16,"I went here last night and it was amazing. I was in a group of 7 and we ordered a ton of food and I was not disappointed in anything. The salted egg yolk custard bun was a new item for me, but it was great, and the smoked duck with black pepper was my favorite. The duck is the stuff of dreams. I can't go into all the food, mostly because I don't know everything we ordered, but I can say that I am confident you could go to Swee Choon Tim Sum, order whatever you want, and be really happy with your decision."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,3-Apr-14,"Best Xiao Long Bao and Har Gau in S'pore and they open very late. Though the queue is always long, the staff are very nice to arrange for us. Quick serve and good food!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,2-Jul-16,"Some portions might be small for hungry people but everything is super tasty. Must try: Har Gao, Century Egg Porridge, Xiao Long Bao."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,14-Jun-15,Great food but long waiting time. Recommend to take away to avoid the long queues. Overall great experience and great food ! Would recommend all tourists to give them a try.
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,21-Aug-16,"I love Swee Choon and find any excuse to go there. I especially love the green beans and the chee cheong fun. I recommend washing it down with less sugar chrysanthemum tea. They are a bit slow with the water, so remind them. Also, the picture menu doesn't match the order sheet exactly, which can be frustrating. The line gets crazy! So don't come when you are in a rush and it's best to come earlier. It's great for groups!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,2,23-Apr-13,Overrated. Used to be good few years ago. But the word got out and it got crowded. Oily food. Overpriced. Who cares if no decor. U can get better elsewhere. Let the uni kids queue for oily food.
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,3,19-Aug-12,"Swee Choon is the place I go to with my friends if we're really hungry at 3 am and we're craving cheap and good food. The food they serve is okay - with dim sum standards like siew mai and chee cheong fun being decent enough to satisfy your cravings, and at 3 am in the morning, you'll be hard pressed to find another restaurant which serves better dim sum. That being said though, don't go to Swee Choon expecting mind blowing, Michelin star worthy food. It is what it is - an after hours restaurant, serving the needs of night owls."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,3,4-Sep-12,"This stall is actually located near Tekka mall and Sim Lim Square about a 10 minutes walk away, facing the macdonald's on the other side of the road. It only opens after 6pm but do be reminded to go early as even if you reach at 530pm there might be a queue there already. I went about 630pm and it took about 20 minutes before we could get in to be seated, but at least the staff passed us the menu to place orders first so that we could pass the waitresses the order chits when we got in. There were some new items on the menu that i never saw before like the fried mee sua which tastes rather interesting but it was really delicious at the same time, who would have thought of fried mee sua wrapped around some carrot cake. There were other usual dim sum items like the black bean pork ribs, char siew buns and siew mai. All were pretty good but the price however came up to about $30+ per pax so be prepared for that. I will still go back nonetheless for their quality of dim sum."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,27-Sep-12,One of the best timsums in town. Was surprised when seeing a lot of people inside the restaurant at midnight! I surely will be back soon.
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,3,28-Oct-14,"Authentic, that's for sure. A bit run down a dirty as well, which I guess is part of the experience but don't expect a nice dining experience : the setting is definitely simple, especially in the tables in the back where roaches are never far. Still it's a nice place for late night chinese cravings as it's open all night long. Food is good, just don't expect it to be Din Tai Fung."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,3-Nov-14,down for dim sums at swee choon anytime!
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,6-Jul-13,"Where would you go if you're so sick since you can't find dim sum in Singapore in the middle of the night? To the hospital of dim sum! This place is seriously looked like a doctor place, bunch of people waiting on the road side sitting on the plastic chair staring at the electronic ticker praying that their numbers to be called next. I was surprised that the line was long when finding parking in this area should also be a separate challenge. Can't really miss this place on Jln Besar since the shop almost occupies the entire block. Go to the podium outside to get a number by telling how many in your party, wait while filling in your order in the form by looking at the big ass laminated menu sampler (not all the things are shown there), hurry back to the podium when your number is shown on the ticker, sit on whatever table the bouncer tell you to, press the bell on the wall when you're ready to order (be warn that nobody gonna ask you about the order unless you do that - I sat for 5 minutes getting confused why nobody came around to ask), and enjoy the fast service, cheap and good dim sum! By cheap I really meant it, I pay just above SGD 20 for 6 items and 2 drinks - it's been a while to find a dim sum place so popular but so cheap in Singapore. Tried the chicken feet, fried shrimp dumpling, fried shrimp in tofu skin, xiao long bao, mixed veggie, and siu mai. Portions are small (most items only has 2 pieces on them) but they didn't skim on the meat - the fried dumpling and tofu skin were pretty packed with shrimp. The veggie looked liked blah when I 1st saw it (we ordered it since it's the only veggie item available on the list), but it was surprisingly tasty and good!"
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,5,6-Jan-18,sweechoon is legendary. i eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner. if u havent tried sweechoon u're missing out on life.
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,23-Oct-14,"My fave place to go to after midnight shopping at Mustafa. I love the custard bun, this is a must MUST have. Sometimes I even order two! Another must try item is the spicy xiao long bao. The filling and skin is the same as the standard liu sha bao but it comes with a spicy sichuan style chilli oil that's my favourite dim sum anywhere."
Swee Choon Tim Sum,4,86,Dim Sum,4,10-Sep-15,"Really local place where it is possible to try a peace of local and hong Kong food. There is always the queue when I come but if u like eat outside, u can make the turn and ask a table outside. Fifth star missing because it is only possible to pay by cash or nets which is not always convenient"
Vespetta Italian Gastro Bar,5,2,"Italian, Bars",5,12-Feb-19,"What an amazing hidden Italian gem restaurant in Boat Clarke. Upon our arrival on a cool evening around 6:00PM, we were greeted by the friendly staff to show us to our river view table.  Bruschetta al Pomodoro - simple and delicious.  Pasta - clams with pasta you can't go wrong with seafood in white wine. I couldn't get enough  Pizza - the pizza amazing, the sauce is fresh along with the prosciutto which equal to epic pizza.  Tip: You need to make reservation to seat near the River view tables."

Native Kitchen,5,1,Asian Fusion,5,15-Nov-22,"This is the restaurant located in Village Hotel at Sentosa. I have chance to have dinner and breakfast there during my recent trip to Singapore. As I always look for local special, one item I love the most about this restaurant is its nasi lemak which is available at breakfast and also regular lunch/dinner menu. What makes it great is not the rice but the achar that came with it. Achar is sort of like a southeast asian kinda pickle which is made from variaty of vegetables and fruit. It's hard to get really tasty achar and this one from Native Kitchen certainly stands out and make the nasi lemak taste lot more. The other shout out about this restaurant is the staffs, they are friendly and awesome, love their service and smile. This restaurant is definitely recommended if you are in the area."

Din Tai Fung,4.2,68,"Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Dumplings",5,11-Sep-23,"After a somewhat light dinner at Hawker Chan in Chinatown, my colleague and I were still craving some dumplings and dessert. For our second dinner, DTF is always a fine option and of the 22 locations in Singapore, the closest one was in the Marina Bay Link Mall. The only issue is that they close at 8:45pm on a Sunday so we had to grab a cab and find the restaurant within the Mall.  Luckily the restaurant had plenty of seating and managed to get us in. Everything we had was 5 stars for sure:  * Iced Lemongrass Drink - Very refreshing and perfect balance of sweet with gingery. * Pork Dumplings with.Chili Oil - I always get these at every DTF. Love the smooth wrappers, moist pork filling, and that mala-spicy chili oil. * Steamed Chili Crab Buns - I don't see these in US branches of DTF, so I'm wondering if its exclusive to Singapore. You get generous helping of minced crab meat with that nice, slightly spicy chili sauce. All the flavors of eating Chili Crab but without the mess and effort in de-shelling! * Black Sesame Desserts - Yes the black sesame steamed buns will always be my favorite. However, the black sesame almond pudding also blew us away. Beautifully presented, chilled to be firm, and just so balanced with sweet and bitter. Definitely bittersweet for me since I'm probably not able to find any dessert this good back in the US."

However, the black sesame almond pudding also blew us away. Beautifully presented, chilled to be firm, and just so balanced with sweet and bitter. Definitely bittersweet for me since I'm probably not able to find any dessert this good back in the US."

The chocolate is super rich in flavor and was very sad that there were a few items unavailable. This is located inside the mall, for anyone not familiar with the area. There is a large window where you can see them making the food fresh by hand. Inside was clean and ample seating for any party size."

Having said that, if you're used to the Din Tai Fung locations in Taiwan or China? Singapore offers a slightly scaled down version more comparable to those locations in Australia.  Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  This Din Tai Fung location is great, tucked away in an underground mall with ample seating. To my great shock, we were seated immediately on a Saturday afternoon and the place was virtually empty. Star.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  $10 SGD for 10 pieces of classic pork XLB is reasonable for Singapore, and other menu items were in the same reasonable ballpark. Refreshing given how expensive things can get here in Singapore. Star.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Everything we ordered was good, with particular kudos to the XLB and the pork buns. One thing that I missed were the leaf wrapped rice dishes that I'm accustomed to in China at Din Tai Fung, but what was offered on the menu (there were other several sold out items) was well executed. Single Star.  Star 5: Would you be excited to go back?  Always. Star."

Ordered the vegetable pork dumpling in chicken broth and that was amazing.  The servers aren't great at communicating in English. Also they are very strange with refilling water ($0.50). They wouldn't unless your glass was empty and would only refill one person at a time and left unless you specifically stated to refill everyone's glass.  Also, double check if your order is correct on the receipt. They misordered one of our dish but luckily I caught it before they sent it out so a new receipt was easily produced."

Didn't have any of their fresh juice drinks or the desserts but they looked really good.  But it's also really cool to watch them make the dumplings.

Din Tai Fung,4.2,68,"Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Dumplings",5,14-Nov-12,"DTF at Singapore is really good. Wow, what a big different in between DTF at So.Cal and DTF Singapore. The quality, the taste, the texture of the food and the presentation. Wow, I can't stop saying Wow!  The restaurant is crowded, but the service is excellent.  +++ Pork dumpling in the spicy sauce: Head down for this one. If I ever mentioned the pork dumpling in spicy sauce is good at So.Cal, I probably never had any better until this one shows up. The flour dough is thin and smooth, meat is juicy, tender, fresh and tasty and the sauce that goes with it is lightly seasoned, but it wasn't bland.You can taste every single ingredients in the bowl. Mr.Q and I ordered 3 times from the same dish. That's how good it is.  +++ Truffle xiao long bao: Normally I am not very fascinated about truffles. However, this time the truffle did work together with the pork bun. The pork bun has a nice aroma of the truffle and also the freshness and the tenderness of the meat filling. Mouth watering when I try to remember how I bite the xiao long bao open and have a sneak peek inside, trying to not drop the xiao long bao while admire it. A excellent must try dish.  +++ Xiao long bao: The flour dough is thin, the soup broth is the bun is tasty and the temperature of the soup is just nice, It didn't burn my tongue. The pork filling is juicy, tender and fresh.   +++Duck roll: Smoked duckling meat in a crispy layer of the spring roll. The duck meat is lightly smoked, chewy(in a good way) and salty, but the green onion and the crispy spring roll balanced the tasty salty duck meat. An excellent dish.  --+ Oriental salad in special vinegar dressing: Crisps greens and soggy rice vermicelli. The sauce wasn't overpowering the salad. However, there wasn't anything special about this dish.  -++ Crab meat xiao long bao: It tasted similar to the xiao long bao, however the crab meat texture is a little bit dry and the broth in the bun is a bit lukewarm.  +++ Steamed red bean bao: The flour dough looks puffy. The bun was fluffy and the filling were lightly sweetened. The aroma of red bean and yam is strong and the filling were moist. It wasn't chunky at all.  +++Lemongrass juice was exotic and interesting. It definitely gives you the coolness in the super hot city.  The only cons that I can think of this place is "" Dear manager, please get rid of the Christmas decorations from last year"".  I highly recommend this DTF for all my Yelpers, if you have the chance to visit Singapore, it's a must go."

Din Tai Fung,4.2,68,"Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Dumplings",5,11-Jan-14,"On a recent trip to Singapore, did my pilgrimage to the local DTF. Partially, because you can never get enough of what may be the best Xiao Long Bao dumplings in the world -- but also as a fan I wanted to compare to the Taiwan and L.A. versions.  I will say that they aren't QUITE as good as those two. Mainly because, I understand, these are franchises rather than direct original family owned like in Taiwan and L.A. Also, they've opened a mind-boggling number of them in Singapore. We were eating in a DTF that was mere blocks from another branch in an adjacent mall.  Even considering that, it is still 5-stars, because even a lesser XLB dumpling from Din Tai Fung by far trumps the best from anywhere else I've ever had. There is no comparison. I also am an advocate for the thinner, lighter skins they use versus the more traditional thicker wrapping. It highlights the filling.  I will say the Singapore restaurants (and Taiwan) have somewhat larger variety than the L.A. branch. However, the juicy pork and juicy pork and crab are unbeatable so it's ""gilding the lily"". Actually, I personally didn't like the truffle dumpling -- which seems to be only available in Asian branches -- very much. I also had the opportunity to eat some other, non-dumpling dishes since my in-laws like the variety and I have to say that DTF also excelled in those as well. Of course, while well executed, these dishes aren't the revelation that their XLB are.  I will shamelessly quote another reviewer, Mel P., because they said it perfectly: ""Din Tai Fung should be some kind of universal translations for 'best dumpling ever'""."

Many things have been said about their classic pork dumplings, but they really are the best! the dough is not too thick or too thin, the meat is a perfect flavour, and the dumplings are steamed to perfection! Little balls of heaven! :)  I also love their fried rice - the egg fried rice is the best I have had yet, and tastes perfect. I have fruitlessly tried to get good basic fried rice and have found that this place does it best.  The garlic chili wantons are great as well, and come in a very tasty dark chili sauce. They also have a small variety of vegetables which are enhanced by some garlic/sauce and taste very good. I have tried the other varieties of dumplings, such as the vegetable ones and the pork and shrimp. They are good but in my opinion, the classic pork ones are the best. The vegetable ones seem a bit dry and the pork-shrimp ones have very thick dough.  The food comes super fast when you're eating in, and of course seems to take longer when you're waiting for it as a take-away! I am super addicted and don't mind the wait, because they make everything fresh.  Regarding the setting - it's located in Marina Bay Link Mall - so basically in an underground tunnel which is also a shopping centre with various shops/cafes. Its not the most relaxing ambiance, but I very much doubt people seek this place out for the amazing setting - the food makes it worth it and the restaurant itself is big enough where you can feel a bit removed if you don't sit right by the window.  Overall, great food and consistent quality!"

Din Tai Fung,4.2,68,"Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Dumplings",4,23-Aug-16,"I always eat here when I'm in Singapore.  Their specialty, the xiao long bao, is what I always get.  When it is crowded or during the holiday season, do expect a longer wait (maybe half hour or more) for your food. Otherwise the food comes pretty quickly if you are there during the off peak period.  This is a chain that's worth trying once."

Though, now I think I know what I need to know to at least write a review. The net of my experience there was that they are FAST and FRESH. I don't know if that is a good thing in a traditional Dim Sum eatery but for us it was great. They had a few entrees that were from a traditional kitchen, think of teriyaki chicken in a sushi restaurant. The food came in shifts like sushi can and it was ALL GOOD. Not great to me but it was good. I would go back and I would wait in line to eat there."

We get three stacks to share between the two and order few extra side dishes we feel like eating that day. (though is it wrong to say that I actually like New York's Joe Shanghai Xia long bao's a bit more? it's a bit thicker and more soup-y than the ones here)  It's a perfect place to pig out after a visit to the Marina bay casinos (for expats).

Din Tai Fung,4.2,68,"Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Dumplings",4,22-Aug-13,"What more needs to be said about Din Tai Fung? The chain leaves Crystal Jade in the dust. Honestly, why do people in Singapore still go to Crystal Jade? That's the kind of crazy they don't even have medication for.  I, for one, am not a fan of the truffle xiao long bao (this may be controversial). I'm an XLB purist (I don't even need vinegar or ginger) and believe the truffle flavour overpowers the awesome minced pork & fat flavour. Din Tai Fung makes a good, solid, dependable basic XLB and you should order like 20 as soon as you sit down. Per person.  Apart from the XLB, I like the pork chop fried rice, the drunken chicken and this prawn pancake thing they have (I forget the name of the dish on the menu). Why people still order dan dan mien here is totally beyond me also. It tastes like nothing but peanuts, people! Check out the braised beef soup also, it's a gem.  This particular DTF is an excellent venue for dinner because there is like, never a queue. Imagine walking straight into a DTF without taking a ticket or having to stand uncomfortably, propped up against a mall fixture, in a sea of people waiting for your number to pop up? A magical utopian wonderland, you say? No! It's Marina Bay Link Mall! Where nobody goes in the evening!  Lunch, however, is a different story."

Din Tai Fung,4.2,68,"Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Dumplings",4,6-Feb-14,"Woohoo! First SG review! What to say except that the dimsums were fabulous? My friend and I ordered quite a lot of food actually, maybe too much, but it felt so right as we were eating these dumplings! We tried steamed dumplings with vegetables, pork, shrimp and crab. Also, we tasted the dates filled with rice and the chili wanton soup. My absolute favorites: the shrimp, and then the veggies. Then, we gave a shot to the sweet dumplings and were absolutely amazed by the coconut peanut ones. As for the red beans, they were not too sweet but the peanut was particularly flavorful. Also, we tried the almond and sesame pudding: quite odd to say, but the almond tasted a bit artificial while the sesame's bitterness was just perfect. Overall, excellent dishes for about $60. Only complaint: the service. I don't know if it's considered normal in SG, but the waiters exclusively spoke Mandarin and the bill was also in Mandarin. My friend who lives here was also shocked, so I guess there could be room for improvement. I guess I'll go back for sure just for the shrimp and the peanut. Except if I find another dimsum place that has even more outstanding flavors!"

I came on a Saturday and surprise surprise the place was relatively empty. We got a seat immediately at 7pm. Contrast this to Tampines Mall or Wisma where you have to wait at least a good 30 minutes before being ushered during dinner peak hours.  That already bumped my rating for this place up a little, and I realised they have fancy schmancy stuff here that perhaps can't be found in other Din Tai Fung outlets - for one the Truffle Xiao Long Bao. It's really pricey at 3.80 per bao but I suppose it will probably have a great aftertaste. The price put me off a little so didn't try but I would certainly recommend anyone to give it a go.  I had the duck crepe thingy here and its really good! The duck aroma immediately fills your mouth the moment you pop each piece in, and it goes down really well when paired with fried rice.  Service is a bit slow but staff are really helpful and courteous so this place gets a five-star from me."

I'm also always quite surprised how so many Americans like the food here. It's interesting to see different form of their XLB - chicken instead of pork in the Indon one. I was always fascinated with the XLB that had assorted colors. It almost makes the meal look like it's something to play with - pink, green, yellow, etc. Other then the delicious pork XLB (they actually don't place the ginger in the soy sauce and eat them in Shanghai itself!), I usually go for the lamian (noodles) or fried rice when I am at DTF alone or not with a large group of friends. The lamian is pretty plain, but it's springly and soaks up the broth and tastes so good in your mouth - just plain noodles and broth. The soup is clear and slightly dark, with a thin layer of oil at the top. Scoop up a while eating the noodles to quench your thirst or if the chilli is too hot! I'm generally a happy man when I get fragrant fried rice with succulent prawns. Add some chilli for a kick! This outlet is pretty good but the people in the Raffles City one seem to one you to hurry up and finish your meal so they can prepare the table for the next guests. They charge for water too, I think."

Din Tai Fung,4.2,68,"Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Dumplings",4,2-May-13,"There may be other, cheaper, places to get dumplings in Singapore, but I particularly appreciate the vegetarian options on the DTF menu. Vegetarian does NOT mean mushrooms or gooey tofu here. Not that there is a ton of variety, but they do the few vegetarian items that they do very well.  The steamed vegetable dumplings are light and tasty. I love the plain noodle bowls with sauce over them. I believe the dan dan noodles and the noodles with peanut sauce (or house sauce or something) are vegetarian. At minimum, they are visibly meat-less.  Admittedly, it is tough to get the staff to stick around your table long enough to answer detailed questions about the menu or ingredients because the place is constantly busy. Language has also been a slight barrier for me at times in cases where I want to know exactly what is in a dish.  There are plenty of plates of lightly sauteed greens on the menu. Yawn. But the surprising favorite in the starters category are cucumbers dressed in some combo of vinegar and soy sauce plus lots of minced garlic. Ridiculous to order simple cucumbers in a restaurant! But I can't always resist, plus I prefer the dressing as a dumpling dip far more than the soy sauce-vinegar-ginger combo I can mix for myself at the table."

Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,2-Feb-24,"Five-star dining while overlooking Singapore? Sign me up.  My fianc¨¦e and I enjoyed a wonderful and romantic dinner here after seeing the nearby light show at the Gardens. Honestly, the worst part of our experience was milling through the throngs of Lunar New Years celebrants in order to get to the Marina Bay Sands. Once we found our way to the building, however, everything went smoothly.  To address a few prior reviews: 1) Unhappy you don't get to walk down to the pool? That's a hotel policy, and not something Spago can address. 2) Surprised by the cost? Spago has easily accessible websites with menus and prices available to everyone. 3) Think portion sizes are too small? Welcome to fine dining. The point is to savor the food, not to be a glutton. You want to walk away feeling satisfied, not like the blueberry girl from a certain chocolate factory. (Pro-tip: The serving sizes were just right). 4) Think service is slow? Once again, such is life at fine dining establishments: Dining is an experience and waitstaff do not want to rush you through it. (Pro-tip: Our server, Ed, was spot on).  Ok, now that we have that out of the way.  I had the grilled octopus and the texture was ethereal. Flavors were well balanced and complimented each other. 5/5  Next was the duck breast. Perfectly cooked, and once again the savory duck paired perfectly with the bright notes of the kumquat and the fennel puree was mild enough to not overpower the rich meat. Did I forget to mention the seared fois gras as well? 5/5  For dessert, we both had the salted caramel souffle. The creme fraiche and the fuji apple sorbet paired perfectly. My only complaint was that I could have used just a smidge more of the sorbet. 5/5  The executive chef went around the tables talking to the customers, which was a nice touch. He recognized our accent and it turns out we grew up in the same area. What a small world. He took us to the other viewing deck and even offered to take a photo of us.  Stellar service, impeccable views, and absolutely incredible food. Spago in Singapore is truly living up to the expectations one has when thinking of Wolfgang Puck.  Bottom line: Wild horses could not stop us from visiting Spago again when we are next in Singapore."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,1,14-Apr-24,"Terrible service. Terrible food. I made a reservation 5 weeks in advance for my wedding anniversary in Singapore. There are 2 restaurants: the more fancier place and the lounge. I am writing about the fancier place.   Upon getting there the hostess tonight was inconsistent about 3 things: 1. She said no open toed shoes for my husband. He was wearing expensive leather slippers. No where was it advertised that slippers were not allowed. See attached dress code policy. 2. She said we could make a one time exception of we were hotel guests. How does a policy that again was not advertised have exceptions? 3. Then they said they called. I received not a single conformation call. Nothing. I checked. We would have worn slacks or different shoes if that was the case. 4. This was a reservation to scout your restaurant to rent the whole restaurant for a 50th wedding party for my parents. We won't be back.  When you have a terrible, inconsistent waitress at the front who was rude to me and my husband, you not only lose my service, you lost a future annuity and get reviews like this who call out that people like your hostess deserve to be fired for incompetence.  Also your food is way overpriced for what it is. I've been to Spago in the US several times. This has got to be a joke of restaurant from food taste to service to overall quality."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,4-Mar-24,"Why pay $32 SGD to go to skydeck, when you can drink and eat at the top of the roof top of MBS. I am extremely surprise about their food was very good. The burger was very good. The view between day and night are absolutely insane and beautiful. The vibe is more relax and chill. I recommend you do reservation early or be there early to do walk-in. They do breakfast, then break before lunch section. The servers and host were very nice. They know that you are tourist and will do the best to accommodate you.  However, our bartender just dont' have any personality and not able to communicate with us. Also, the host told us that no reservation and we can only stay for 1.5 hours. However, there are many open tables and the host didn't care if we stay longer than 1.5 hours as long as we are drinking and enjoying the time up there. Great view and make sure you ask them to take a picture of you that with the view of infinite pool. No, you cannot walk outside!! That's only for people stay in the hotel. I believe there is two different section that one side is the bar and other side is more formal dining."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,1-Jul-24,Very very delicious! Lovely view of the city and staff was very sweat!  Got appetizers as a light meal and it was quite filling. Pasta was very delicious but very tiny so I recommend adding additional appetizers.
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,6-Jan-24,"It's been over six years since I first reviewed Spago, I've been to many other places since but my opinion remains the same.  The place is just fantastic, I recommend everyone to go - the view is spectacular , the cocktails are great and the food is exceptional .  Throughout the years I've visited numerous times Spago has always delivered without fail. Highly recommended!  PS: don't miss out on the Tuna Cones (even if they are not on the menu, they can still serve them and they are da bomb)."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,3-Apr-17,"I have taken quite a few visiting friends to CE LA VI however, I never really liked it: service is very average and f&b offerings are generally disappointing . But obviously you are there for the amazing view. Why no-one ever told me before that there is a much better alternative is a puzzle to me!!  Spago Bar & Lounge is simply AWESOME:  - the view is in my opinion even better than CLV, you can see the whole of Marina Bay plus you get to see the well known MBS infinity pool. - the service is on point, from the person picking up the phone over the hostess to the waiters, all were really helpful and pro-active. - the food is amazing, who would have thought that a tourist trap such as the MBS rooftop serves on of the BEST burgers in Singapore? And the Tuna Tartare cones are to die for! - the drinks are really great, I am known to be quite picky on my cocktails. Both the Hot Legs and Grin n Bare It were fantastic.  The only downside is that they do not serve Ranch Dressing to go with their otherwise delicious burger and fries. I honestly cannot wait to try the other snacks of the bar menu and their full restaurant menu.  So I can tell you, you won't see me again at CE LA VI anytime soon - unless Calvin Harris (preferably doused in Ranch) comes and invites me personally."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,17-Dec-23,Amazing view and ambience from the 57th floor.  Observed my mother's 81st birthday at table that was steps away from an amazing bird's eye view of Singapore.  Ordered ginger ales and Japanese fried chicken.  Excellent service to top it all off!  Highly recommend reserving a table at sunset which is always around 7pm.
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,11-May-24,"We got treated for dinner here by relatives to celebrate my husband and my wedding. The food here is delicious, we both got the prix fixe menu. Service was impeccable, everyone was prompt and kind. Highly recommend!"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,25-Nov-23,"Five star hotel in Singapore with five star restaurant on top of MBS next to the Infinity Pool on the rooftop with outdoor and indoor dining. The wait staffs are mostly from surrounding countries serving international guests with great care and outstanding service. The food quality is above average but the variety is not as extensive as the buffet on the first floor. The menu includes all kinds of drinks and international dishes that are served perfectly and extremely fast. I loved their noodle dishes and the variety of breakfast options. The portion size was small enough that you could try other foods with ease. The pancakes were delicious with butter and blueberry jam sprinkled with maple syrup, and Laksa noodle soup was rich and savory. The Pork skin noodle dish was really tasty. Overall very deserving five stars if you are hungry."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,2-Dec-23,"Our only disappointment is that we were not allowed to walk down to the pool to take photos. Instead, we had to take them over some hedges and through plexiglass. And the view is exactly why we chose to dine here, because our tour had us staying in another hotel and the only way to see the famous infinity pool is to stay at Marina Bay Sands or dine in one of the few rooftop restaurants. We bailed on our Spago bar reservation after dinner because the drinks were so expensive.  We enjoyed our $88, 3-course meals (my lamp pork chops were not gamey at all) and the gals loved their seafood dishes. The drinks were crazy expensive though! ($35 for a glass of red wine was average price)  The 3 course meal came with a starter. I got the soup. The pumpkin/carrot/squash (I can't recall exactly) was good, but a very small portion. My lamp chops were very good, and the dessert (we all chose the souffl¨¦) was very tasty. However, the portions are all very small, so we now know how rich people stay so thin.  The view was stunning and you could see the pool, but the hedges dividing the pool and restaurant patio, made it difficult to take photos with both us, the pool and the view. However, on the other side of the restaurant is a gorgeous view of the Supergrove Tree Gardens. At night, it is a sight to behold!  It is worth coming up here - just beware of the cost associated it."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,22-Sep-23,"Was surprised this place was so good. Did not feel like leaving the hotel tonight so we got reservations here. They have a really good prix fixe menu for $88 and if you a bigger portion of the main - Lamb or Pork - it is $26 extra but well worth it, I also opted for $10 extra for the grilled octopus. Menu changes frequently so wont go into specifics on each food items but Octopus was fantastic and the pork was very tender and delicious. The service was on point. Very friendly staff and ambiance you could not beat on the 57th floor overlooking the pool that overlooks Singapore. I would defiantly come back."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,3,27-May-24,The food was good but the tables and chairs are very low. It makes it so you have to bend over to eat. It may look interesting but uncomfortable.
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,18-Dec-23,My favorite restaurant/lounge during my visit to Singapore. Proper lounge experience. They serve apperitivo. The place is my cousin's to go places. The drinks are great & the small plates are really good. The people (staff) and the hospitality are top notch. The Manager on duty Khrisna made sure that we had a great time. We sat by the bar and bar ambiance is really nice as well. You overlook the hotel's pool. The hospitality here is like in the US -- after all they have a branch in Vegas so they know what's up! I'd reccomend having dinner or cute drinks here before going to CLV next door for some dancing and nice DJ. Khrisna also said they will have live music soon in 2024! Highly recommend this place.

Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,3,26-Aug-23,"All the cocktails on point ! Service kind of lacking . Especially on the food side . Some examples: Ordered 3 cheese, dropped off and no explanation what cheese is what ! Chicken karrage, dropped off several pieces feel off onto table and waitress just walked away. All drinks out after all food served and eaten . I get it ! Big name, big hotel , but cmon that just really simple stuff that waiter/waitress need to work on or should already know to do."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,2,26-Dec-22,"This is one of the rooftop restaurant at the Marina Bay Sands luxury hotel,(Tower 2), the famous hotel that looks like it has a ship at the top.  My colleagues and I were so excited to try this place and check out the view but were sorely disappointed. This place is definitely a tourist trap! The service was so slow. We didn't have a reservation so we first waited in line to get in and after 20 minutes, was able to get a table for 4. They limit us to 1 hour sitting but service was soooo slow we only got one round of drinks. It took them nearly 50 minutes to take our order then bring out the drinks. And then another 15 mins to get the check but they overcharged us. We wanted to get Happy hour drinks but they charged us full price ($27 Singapore dollars!). Definitely had Vegas vibes. The drink was fine, didnt taste the alcohol, not amazing. Only one cocktail special for Happy hour is so weak.  The only pro was the great view. The bar is next to a beautiful infinity pool and a gorgeous view of the city landscape. The interior designed has a plantation like vibe, with fat striped painted walls ceiling fans.  Once was enough, not coming back here."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,17-May-23,"Great food, ambiance and views!! Very reasonable, competitive prices for the food quality and location. We chose the prefix menu with appetizer, entree and dessert, which cost about $90 Singapore dollars (about $65 USD) - there are no additional large service fees unlike US. Bread selection was broad and we enjoyed the two types of butter. Amuse bouche was Brazilian cheese bread. Cod was moist and cooked perfectly, actually quite memorable and delicious. We had a pool front view so we watched the sunset over the horizon. I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and can't wait to return! Lots of food options, across broad price spectrums in Singapore, but this is a good one if you want marina bay sands views but aren't staying at the hotel. You can also visit the Spago bar for a drink/snack for less costly option. Note restaurant also has an Al La Carte option as well as 3 course menu."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,21-Jul-22,Excellent place to wine down and chilled out after a long exhausted day with a beautiful view of Singapore and yummy food and drinks The drink has mango infused tea and vodka. It's very refreshing with the right amount of alcohol. Beef sliders are good cheesy and a crunch of pickle and too cute to eat. Oh well!

Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,27-Jan-24,Amazing views and a lovely ambiance. We were seated in the Bar/Lounge area and the menu was simple but very good. They were very busy and the service was average.
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,31-Jan-24,We ordered several of the bar bites and they were all delicious! Prices were very reasonable for a place like Spago. The falafel burger and chicken sandwich also came with a huge bowl of fries. Great outdoor bar area with amazing views from the 57th floor!
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,3,2-Nov-22,"If you are coming for the views this is the place to be. However, if you are staying at Marina Bay Sands --I would skip this place.  Perhaps I had too high of an expectation. I would argue that it's pretty expensive for what it is and for the amount.  Nothing screams amazing when I had the food, but the restaurant is strategically placed next to the infinity pool and does provide a great view for patrons.  Service was also really slow. Don't know if we went during the wrong time or just had a really slow waiter, but it took forever to get a menu.  1. chicken laksa spring roll - was certainly creative but did not blow me away. I would have preferred it to be more savory. 2. crispy shrimp tempura - basic, could get this at any sushi place. 3. red-snapper ceviche was pretty good and fresh --but definitely an appetizer, there was not very much of it.  I would recommend the drinks --food not so much."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,13-Nov-23,"Good food with large portions, and since it's located at top, the marina Bay Sandw, hotel in Singapore, a fabulous view."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,6-Oct-23,Delicious and unique grilled cheese sandwiches. Large menu and half a dozen pages of different drinks and alcohol. Phenomenal view from the 57th floor of Marina Bay Sands.
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,1-Sep-22,"The jewl of Marina Bay Sands.  Spago is an upscale dining establishment perched right along the infinity pool on the roof of the iconic Singapore Hotel. If you want a terrific view, morning, noon, or night, book it.  We came while it was raining and the canopy still protected us. Not a drop of water on our bodies, and the wind didn't move a hair."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,4-Aug-23,"Spent my daughter's birthday here and the food, service and ambiance were perfect! They held our table for us even though we had the wrong time. The staff were kind and helpful. They not only took our online request to have a birthday candle for my daughter, but they also gave a birthday card signed by the staff! Much better service than Ce La Vi!"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,3,23-Dec-21,"Food: I thought the food was amazing :-) they have a 3-course lunch set meal now going for SGD$65, including a starter, a main and dessert. The oysters and sashimi were really fresh, and the salmon main dish that I got was so incredibly flavorful with sushi rice patted underneath it. My mom and sister adored the coconut dessert - which is rare, because my experience with restaurants in MBS is that the hype is all in the view and location, and very little to do with the actual quality/taste of the food.  Service: Our servers were funny and sweet which is why I hesitate to say anything bad about them. We went near Christmas on a Thursday afternoon and I'm not sure if they were understaffed, but it was hard to get anyone's attention to ask for sauces/even pepper and salt. They would whisk plates and utensils away and give us new ones while forgetting spoons or anything so we would just sit there for a long time waiting for someone to kindly notice and give us utensils. The meal genuinely felt like it took hours to finish - and not in a good way. The small round tables also felt kind of awkward and uncomfortable - and the single one round table given to us was much too small for the three of us and all the dishes we ordered. I'd give the service a 2/5 unfortunately"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,3-Jun-20,"Spago is such a splendid place to visit. I've been here several times on for numerous occasions whenever I am in Singapore. The atmosphere, views and service bring me back. I frequently stay at MBS - this is my go-to eatery.  My most recent visit I took my family to enjoy the spectacular view that oversees the infamous infinity pool on the top of MBS. You get amazing views of the city, better than from the Observation Deck. My suggestion for a prime MBS experience: sit on one of the booths that overlooks the pool and the city, order a bucket of fries (because we Americans love our fries) and the pitcher for 4. But get one for each person. You'll all want your own.  I'm already looking forward to my next visit to Spago! I always am as soon as I leave."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,1,6-Nov-22,"If you want 1 star service at 5 star prices, this is your place. I truly enjoyed waiting in line for 30 minutes for a S$64 breakfast to be sat on a stool with no back. When I asked for a chair with a back I was told no. I could take the table or go back into the queue and start over.The hostess was outright rude. When I asked for the manager, she told me to go back and get in line in the queue."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,27-Dec-18,"Had an amazing lunch at Spago. Beautiful views of the Gardens by the Bay from the top of Marina Bay Sands. Excellent food and service. A remarkable price (45 SGD per person for three courses). The portions are also very generous. It's amazing to go to such a high-end restaurant and not leave hungry. Unequivocally recommend this place.  Appetizers: Pat¨¦ de Campagne, delicious and a large portion Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones, two, small, delicious one-bite cones  Mains: Grilled Chicken Cobb Salad, perfect execution on this classic Steamed Japanese Sea Bream, large portion, good flavor, beautiful presentation  Dessert: Pistachio Panna Cotta, one of the best desserts I've had all year"

Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,9-Jul-18,"Perched atop the famous Marina Bay Sands is Spago, a Wolfgang Puck restaurant that has locations around the world. My personal favorite is the Beverly Hills location but the Singapore location has the best views by far.  I went for lunch and made a 12pm reservation in hopes of dodging the suits that were sure to fill the dining area later in the afternoon. Getting to the top of MBS is always an adventure and I got lost as I took the wrong elevator in Tower 2 (which only took me to the 22nd floor) but eventually made it to the top after three elevator transfers. The proposed route involves two elevator transfers so keep an eye out for the lifts that take you up to the 55th floor in Tower 2 and then take a second lift up to the 57th floor. Upon arriving you'll see the Spago Bar and Lounge to your right and the fine dining area to your left. Straight ahead you'll see glimpses of the mouth-dropping view through the welcome area.  The fine dining area has a dress code of business casual and I saw many people turned away for wearing flip flops or swim gear (the restaurant shares a roof with an infinity pool) so I put on a decent dress with slip on sneakers. It seemed to work just fine and I was seated promptly by the window which overlooks the water where you can watch the ships hang out just past the Gardens by the Bay.  The staff were so nice and didn't seem to mind me, a lone blogger, taking a table all to myself. The interior of the dining room is gorgeous with white table cloths and a beautiful orchid center piece. It honestly seemed a lot classier than the Beverly Hills Spago and WAY classier than the Las Vegas Spago (which I think shut down -- good riddance.) I was presented with a very luxe a la carte menu for lunch but opted to go with the Express Prix Fixe: 3 Courses for $45.  The Express Lunch is quite the deal as I recently paid $36 just for one Singapore Sling. I also got my favorite cocktail, Peace on Earth, for an extra $25. I originally ordered the tuna cones but they already had one made for me so I swapped out my first course for the Chicken 'Laksa' Spring Roll per the recommendation of the staff. This appetizer is unique to the Singapore Spago and I'm really glad I made the swap.  I wasn't sure I wanted anything fried but the spring rolls were cooked to perfection and filled with a warm Asian flavors with a thicker curry texture. There is a delicious coconut flavor that lingered with each bite. I didn't see coconut listed as part of the dish so perhaps I imagined it. Whatever it was, it was great. I enjoyed the tuna cone but it paled in comparison to the Spring Rolls.  Next, I got the Steamed Red Snapper. It looked absolutely stunning. The fish was cooked well and the garnish tasted of a light soy sauce and was enjoyable on its own. It's served with a side of rice which was tasty. I tested the sauce that was on the side but I wasn't a fan so I skipped it. I will say that the flavors of the dish, while delicious, were clearly on or around the fish. If you're looking for a fish with deep flavors infused into every bite, you wont get it with this Snapper. However, if you're like me and you appreciate the natural taste of fish, it's pretty good.  Finally, it was time for dessert. Each Express Lunch comes with a Pistachio Panna Cotta. On a hot day, this dessert is truly refreshing with orange flavors all over the panna cotta. There's a lot going on on top of the actual dessert (candied this and that) but the orange gelato was fantastic and the panna cotta itself (ignoring the Pistachio Brittle and other toppings) was divine.   The quality of food, decor, and service at Spago never disappoints (except in Vegas) and I would highly recommend going to Spago for a business lunch or a special occasion. If you only plan to go to Singapore once, definitely go to Spago for either dinner or just head to the lounge. If you come to Singapore often, it's not a must unless you are in the mood for stunning views paired with delicious views. I'll probably be back at some point.  TOTAL COST: $83.57  57th Floor of Marina Bay Sands, Tower 2 Singapore  This is copy and pasted from my blog of solo travels and solo reviews."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,31-Mar-18,Fantastic meal high up on top of Marina Bay Sands. Sat by the window which was nice for seeing the tree light show below. FYI shows are at 7:45 and 8:45 pm.  Had both an appetizer (white asparagus) and main dish (lamb). There is a good wine list to complement the food. A selection of breads with both salted and unsalted butter was delicious!  We did not order desert but they provided a very nice anniversary plate to celebrate our special occasion.
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,8-Dec-19,"One of the best views of the city without a doubt!  Was here for a company happy hour event. They have a minimum spend for large groups but the host was gracious enough to accomodate us even otherwise. Drinks are nice and strong, and they have some excellent canap¨¦s as well. Service is great as well. Its right next to the infamous infinity pool though that is for guests only. It's expensive though given the location and the view, the cost is worth it!"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,9-Jan-20,"Absolutely insane cocktails! Kind of expensive th  1. Stunning views, but great ambiance 2. Music is popping later, best at sundowners 3. Menu is not super loaded 4. Great for short lunch rendezvous"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,16-Sep-19,"View is amazing. This bar is next to the infamous infinity pool, so if you can't afford a night in the hotel and still was to see the pool, this is going to be your best option. I absolutely loved the view.  Menu prices are decent for being what it is and where it is. For Singapore, the prices are pretty average.  I recommend coming to this spot highly if you're unable to stay a night at this hotel!"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,17-Oct-19,"To be honest we came here to eat just because of the view and being Californians it seemed very appropriate. Naturally this restaurant will be everything you expected to be, incredible service, incredible food, and a view that rivals every other view."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,2,13-Aug-17,"As a part of our stay at Marina Bay Sands, we were looking forward to the dining options offered at such a luxurious place. During the time of our stay we were told that they were in midst of constructing a new dining area and there were a few choices to choose from, one of which was Spago.  Spago is located on the 57th floor, which is where the infinity pool is located. We were seated immediately upon arrival and introduced to the breakfast buffet offerings. The space inside was kind of cramped with the amount of guests and servers walking back and forth. The breakfast area was quite limited and selection smaller than what I expected. There was cheese and charcuterie, fruits, yogurt, cereal, oatmeal, smoked salmon, greens, muffins, and croissants. Juice, milk, coffee, and tea were also available. Our server came by to take our orders for the hot menu items once we were done with the self serve items. We ordered an omelet and smoked salmon eggs benedict.  When the eggs came out we were surprised to find a small omelet and a very small eggs benedict dish. When I order benedicts, I expect an order to have two. However, Spago only gives one...kind of strange in my opinion. A few minutes after receiving those hot items, we got the bill slapped onto our table. I understand that they are busy and are trying their best to get hotel guests in and out of the dining area, but come on.  The smoked salmon eggs benedict was delicious albeit shameful for such a fancy place (but had a superb buttery flavor). The omelet was your typical omelet with whatever meats and veggies you wanted to add. I'm not sure if Marina Bay Sands will continue to utilize the same restaurant to serve breakfast to its guests after its new constructions but we thought that this was the least appealing part of our stay.  I can't speak for dinner service here but the pro I got from my experience was the view from the skyscraper."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,29-Nov-19,"Wonderful lunch spot with the incredible 57th floor views of Singapore and the Bay. Our reservation timed perfectly with a thunderstorm so we got to watch the clouds roll in.  We enjoyed the Grilled Organic Chicken Club - Brioche, Apple Wood Smoked Bacon, Avocado, Sunny-Side Up Egg, Comt¨¦ Cheese, Herb Aioli. Super soft bread and tons of veggies.  And the Bincho Grilled Salmon Salad - Hijiki Seaweed Rice, Korean Banchan, Gochujang, Sesame, Chili  The salmon fell apart as soon as my fork touched it- perfectly buttery and light. The array of types of salads beneath the salmon was really neat to experiment with. I paired with the Wolfgang Puck Chardonnay and could not have been happier."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,31-Oct-16,"The restaurant was located at level 57 of Marina Bay Sands. One had to take the lift at Tower 2 to level 55 before changing another lift to level 57. The restaurant overlooked the swimming with a nice view of the city. I was showed to a table indoor by the window, but the view was blocked by the green.  I was having the 3-course restaurant week lunch ($40++). I was served an assorted of bread rolls consisted of mini-sized French baguette and Rustic Italian Ciabatta Bread Roll, stuffed with dried fruits, served with salted and unsalted butter on a marble slab. Both rolls were crusty and soft inside. I personally preferred the ciabatta roll with the salted butter which enhanced the sweetness of the dried fruit's taste.  Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones (ala carte $36++/ 3pieces) Chili Aioli, Soy, Wasabi, Shaved Bonito, Scallions, Masago The raw tuna was refreshing, combined with the crunchy and slighty spicy cone. However I felt the wasabi taste came across a tab too strong.  Soft French Omelet (ala carte $28++) Field Mushrooms, Gruyere Cheese, Roasted Fingerling Potatoes, Arugula Salad Cut opened, the inside of the omelet was filled with melted cheese and soften shiitake mushroom slices. The baby potato's taste was greatly enhanced by the shaved cheese on top.  Coconut-Passion Fruit Trifle Coconut Mousse, Almond-Nutmeg Meringue, Passion Fruit Cream It looked simple, but the taste and texture was a combination of crispy crunchy rice crisp, sour raspberries, rich creamy coconut mousse and creamy almond cream.  Finished the meal with a pot of White Tea ($10++), which was light and refreshing. It was served with some biscuits.  Overall the food was great. Service was great too with the staffs checking on the food from time to time. The only con was the noisy table of Indonesians sitting next to me, making a headache growing inside me."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,11-Oct-17,"The top of this Sands is an unbelievable setting and an amazing view - there is no question about that. The restaurant is lovely and has gone out of its way to make sure that most (all?) tables have amazing views. That is reason enough to come have a meal here. I recommend coming during the day, as the view of downtown Singapore is great during the day and there is some amusing people watching at the rooftop pool right next to the restaurant.  That being said, the restaurant is quite good and manages to avoid the typical pitfall of the scenic view restaurant - nice house, too bad no one's home. The food was excellent and definitely approachable for the tourist crowd without being boring. No small accomplishment. Dumplings, KBLT, and Soft Omelet were all delicious. KBLT was really really good.  Only two issues with the place. The Tuna Tartare cones were off and we sent them back. They did come right off the bill, so all good there. The second is the (typical for Singapore) disinterested level of service. We had several long, awkward service gaps which required us to flag down our (often absent) waiter. We had to ask for more water, etc. It was a non-stop cavalcade of flagging down wait staff to handle things which should have been handled. While annoying, this is what I have come to expect in Singapore so I only get mildly annoyed now that my expectations have been beaten into shape."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,18-Jan-18,"Happy hour 4-7 10$ beers (3 to choose) 16$ drinks (6 to choose) 14-16$ wines (4 to choose l)  Appetizers. Grilled cheese (yum!) Fried chicken bites (yum) Spring roll (yum) Salmon (no idea)  Glynn the manager is welcoming and is interested in those spending time, effort and money to be here. It is truly refreshing to see a manager, staff, restaurant get that the simplest welcoming and earnest hello from staff brings out wallets and creates instant customer retention. The whole staff and experience is welcoming. This is a busy, Very high end restaurant. It is not cheap. Those coming here expect to be delivered the best service and expect to pay for the service and ambiance too. This place does not disappoint  Makes me really happy And it is my number one recommendation in Singapore. (Level 33 is my second)"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,9-Aug-22,Everyone says to go to Spago for the views and they're not wrong. The views are insane but you can only really see it if you're seated on the edge. I sat at the bar and ordered the sliders (yum!) and the love me long time. The food was amazing and so was my drink. The bartenders were lovely and also made me a small drink to also try.
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,9-Apr-18,"Amazing! Food was superb - every small plate was absolutely delicious and perfect. The staff were very attentive without being in your way. Tables are spaced a reasonable distance apart. Cocktails were tasty!  But the views. From the 57th floor, open air with infinity pool in front of you, 360degree views that are dazzling. The Garden by the Bay, the city skyline, the cargo ships lined up like an old painting in a museum.  Words don't do it justice. It was expensive, but oh so worth it!!"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,12-Dec-17,"I'll be honest. I didn't have high expectations for this place. I thought that they were going to be snobby like their rooftop counterpart at Ce La Vie. I thought the food was going to be subpar and overpriced.  To my surprise, I was wrong. Our waitress was fantastic and super friendly. The staff here clearly know the food on the menu well, and seemed to have tried all the dishes, so they were able to make great recommendations.  Here are a few reasons to come: -Amazing view, it is right by the pool. Instead of paying to go to the pool to enjoy the view, why not com here instead? -The prie fixe lunch menu won't break the bank, it is $45. -The food is creative and good.  Let's start with the atmosphere. The windows were huge and bright, allowing you to enjoy the sunshine and take in the view of the beautiful Singapore skyline. There is a huge vase with hanging orchids in the middle of the room. The open kitchen is great, you can watch the chefs prepare your food. Also, the bathrooms are great. There are individual private stalls.  Let's talk about the food.  Appetizers: Chicken 'Laksa' Spring Roll: This was my favorite appetizer. The flavor was unique. I've never had such a delicious spring roll before and would highly recommend it.  Pan Seared Pork Dumplings: This was good too, but you can easily get pork dumplings anywhere.  Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones: I felt as if I was eating a tiny ice cream cone filled with tuna tartare. The presentation was beautiful. You definitely should order this.  Main Course: Grilled Iberico Pork. The pork was cooked to perfection, it was so tender and juicy.  Desert: Pistachio Panna Cotta Amazing.  After eating your meal, you can take some great pics by the pool. Don't worry, there are no rude staff from Ce La Vie to tell you that you cannot take pictures unless you get bottle service. You are free to stand there as long as you like to take photos!"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,23-Dec-18,Best place to chill in evenings and try some food and cocktails together ! There are hidden cocktails which you can order only if you have been there ! I wouldn't revel the secret as it's really amazing to order those exclusive cocktails ( not in the menu ). The staff is very friendly and best time to go is between 4-8pm when there is easy availability of seats to relax and enjoy the evening. Price is on higher side for every dish compared to normal Places due to its location and view of the entire city !
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,3,30-Jan-20,"We went here for drinks and they have super sweet cocktails. We ordered 5 and couldn't finish half of any of them. On the other hand, the drinks are huge!  Other then that, we had a great view of the gardens from our table."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,1,18-Jan-23,"Worst Spago I have ever been! If there was a ""0"" star that is what I would have rated. When asked to sit outside we were told they were all taken. Sat inside with very little visible view. The waiter did not even come by with menu's for 15 minutes. Then another 15-20 minutes passed by and still no one to take our order. I noticed that a table became available and asked the hostess to be seated there. She said ok, but it took about 10+ minutes for them to clean it up and re-set. The pasta I ordered was very spicy and was not warned. Our much worse waiter was very inattentive who did not fill my water glass for nearly 30 minutes. I left most of my food uneaten. No questions asked he grabbed my plate and took it away. NO ""Are you finished?"", ""Was everything OK with your meal?"", ""Should I wrap that up?"" Nothing was offered to replace. A very bad Spago experience. No wonder that was the only place there was a reservation available."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,9-Jul-17,"Let's just say that the setting is amazing perched high on the mount, the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel. You are somewhat secluded and separated from the rest of the masses that seek out the infinity pool below you which is comforting. And the interior certainly has an air or sophistication about it that keeps it classy.  My dinner was excellent though the portions were on the lean side for the price. That being said, I'd eat there tomorrow any time. But the ambience was rather sterile. May be it was a just a quiet boring crowd, us included.  The price of the wine was laughable. I'd rather leave with a better taste in my mouth than a bitter feeling of being robbed. It kind of tarnished the whole experience for me. Mind you, that is kind of the vibe I get from being at the Marina Bay Sands anyway. A kind of ""Give us your money and go"" feeling."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,23-Nov-16,"Great spot for the view, some drinks and good food. A great combination makes this place a must visit for the Singapore experience. There are 360 views of the harbor, city etc. and the time of the day is not relevant as there is always something of beauty to see whether it is the sunset or the lit city and surrounding areas.  Food consisted mostly of appetizers which included well executed sushi rolls and a few other items.  Great experience overall."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,20-Aug-16,"Completely speechless! What can I say other than beyond amazing food, service and views?!  DO NOT miss going to this place if you are in Singapore.  I had the lobster risotto, goat cheese and beet salad, and a dessert which I can't remember the name. All of it amazing!!"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,22-Oct-15,"This restaurant is opened by Wolfgang Puck, a name that is very familiar when it comes to fine dining. It's his second restaurant in Singapore after CUT which is another grandiose masterpiece.  His first Spago restaurant in Beverly Hills was awarded with 2 Michelin Stars. The menu here is said to be mainly focused on 'Californian cuisine' that includes seasonal dishes prepared and cooked in an avant-garde manner.  However, I personally think that most of the food here is quite creative, extremely delicious and impeccably influenced by Asian cuisine for example; Hokkaido Scallop Sashimi ($34) Honey Miso Broiled Japanese Black Cod ($49) Steamed Salmon ""Hongkong Style"" ($42) Kaya Toast with Seared Foie Gras and Pandan-Coconut Jam ($33)  If you fancy a more casual atmosphere, there is a terrace lounge side offering another delicious Asian influenced bites like Pork Pot Sticker Dumplings ($15), Grilled Korean Pork Belly ($19) and Chinese Bao & Glazed Short Ribs ($16).  Overall, I'm impressed and it totally exceeded my expectation!! I'll be back.  Note: The lounge overlooks MBS' famous infinity pool with a spectacular view of the city skyline which is totally a PLUS! I love this romantic place indeed."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,28-Sep-16,"It's funny because I live 10 minutes away from Santa Monica and Spago was the first meal I had in Singapore. Their seafood is imported from the farmers markets of Santa Monica so that was kind of funny.  The food was beyond incredible. The Kaya toast was the die for but my boyfriend loved loved loved the veal tartare. I also loved loved loved the oyster gratin. The small appetizer bites were packed with flavor and freshness. It was one amazing bite after another.  For entrees, my friend got the veal chop which was amazing and you should totally get that. The crispy skin sea bass was also delicious.  For dessert, I was in love with, and still dream about, the chocolate semifredo. Omg. Do it, get it! Everything I ate was mind blowing.  We basically ate every appetizer and every dessert. Everything was amazing and you basically can't go wrong with anything you order here. Yum yum! I would go back if I was in Singapore again.  The view was amazing from the top floor, we even got to see fireworks because Formula 1 was in town and wrapping up!"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,11-Aug-17,"I'd heard negative things about the food at Spago, so we opted to come up to the bar for a drink and skip the food entirely. Great decision, since the drinks were awesome and we were happy! Incredible views from the top of MBS without a cover charge, and plenty of lounge seating available. Spago has more of a chill atmosphere when compared to the other bar/club options at MBS, which was perfect for us."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,17-Nov-18,"The view is beautiful as hell the food and drinks are extraordinary!!! The price is not too expensive for the test, beauty and enjoyment you get!!!"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,10-Nov-19,Second night in a row here. The drinks are fantastic. The view of the skyline is beautiful and the halo halo dessert is heavenly. I had halo halo several times in the Philippines but I actually preferred this version over what I've had in the home that originated the unique cultural dessert. Definitely suggest trying it.
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,11-Jan-18,"I was pleasantly surprised by our experience at Spago by Wolfgang Puck at the Marina Bay Sands. After all, this was the tourist attraction in Singapore located in a hotel and casino complex with numerous restaurants and bars. However, having just viewed a documentary on Netflix on the world's great hotels, I gained some incredible insight into the inner workings of this giant city in the sky.  Spago is located on the Sky Park which you can access via elevator in tower 2. It'll take you up to the 50 something floor where you'll need to transfer to another set of elevators to take you all the way up to the top. Don't be surprised when you exit the first set of elevators directly into a lounge. Just turn left and head toward the other set of elevators. Once on the Sky Park level, you'll have two options. If you're a guest of the hotel, you're keycard will give you access to the pool area...however, if you're like most of us, you can only line up at Spago. Once at the front of the line, they should in theory ask you if you're there for dinner or drinks and I assume if you're there for dinner you probably already have a reservation. We were there for dessert. They'll seat you pretty far away from the edge, so if you want to take pictures of the Singapore skyline or the Gardens by the Bay, don't be afraid to get up and move around.  The bar menu was small and expensive, but the flavors were on point or at least what we had. Just to illustrate how much expensive the menu is, two small orders of a granita type dessert cost more than our four lunch and dinner combined. However, price aside you're there really for the ambiance and they do have that in abundance. It's a cross between LA hipster and Vegas glam. It's not for everyone, but it's worth a visit just as the Marina Bay Sands is worth a visit while in Singapore."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,31-Jul-17,"Phenomenal meal!! Definitely my favorite restaurant I've eaten at in nearly 3 years in Singapore. The food is amazing. We had the beet salad, honey glazed black cod, tuna tartare and the caramel souffle, all of which were delicious and unique. The honey glaze on the black cod was sooooo gooooood!!  On top of that, the service was the best. Michael and his team were so attentive and explained every little detail of the menu. They took the time to visit, but service was very efficient and professional. They also know their food and understand both gluten-free and vegetarian concerns very well.  Oh, and view at night is beautiful. It all made for a perfect evening."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,16-Sep-18,I love the place! They view is spectacular! We were greeted by John (TJ) and he assisted us on what to order. He's so impressive because he knows everything in the menu. He's the best! Look for him when you go to this place. We only ordered drinks and each one of them is bomb bomb bomb. Will definitely come back!
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,8-Apr-16,"This review is only for the Lounge & Bar area.  Food is amazing, while the menu is small the quality is top  The views are amazing! There is fresh area, plants and just a wonderful atmosphere.  Staff is friendly and professional  I can only recommend going there."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,12-May-18,Beautiful venue and the cocktails are reasonably priced especially if your order Come on get lucky  Fantastic views as you would expect from the TOP of Marina Bay Sands
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,13-Aug-19,"Being at the top of the ""boat"" at the top of the Sands in the hottest spot in Singapore is enough reason to go. The bartender is amazing, the scene would make anyone envious, and watching people swim in the infinity pool at the top of the world is about as perfect a view as there is. But then the food... A very expensive burger as you would expect - with the ideal brioche bun and seasonings reflective of the region, and fries crispy on the outside soft in the middle. The only thing keeping it from five stars was that I was emphatic about a medium rare burger (they acted as though I was crazy for ordering it) and then served it well done. Bot a glimmer of pink. Oh well, totally worth it anyway. :)"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,19-Jan-20,The view is great from up here. This is a better alternative to queuing up for the sky park.
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,1,25-Oct-17,"Myself and my colleagues were in Singapore to celebrate a wonderful achievement, one that brought over 700 of us into the city. We specifically went to Spago to enjoy the Singapore skyline and wonderful cocktails. Everything to be fully paid for without issue, similar to any other business trip.  About an hour into our evening a man, whom I can only assume was the Manager, approached me to begin questioning our stay. He highlighted that some of our colleagues had already left without paying, something that is quite normal given we expense everything to the same firm. When I told him not to worry, that we plan to pay the bill in full, he began to pressure me further and express concern that they couldn't split the bill 20 ways. He was presuming each of us would pay separately. When I explained to him, again, that would not be an issue he refused to accept nor believe my statement.  Instead of staying and enjoying the evening, this experience made us feel unwelcome so we cashed out and left. It was one of my most frustrating experiences in quite some time, and dealt with by Spago in a rather insulting manner. If they were concerned we would have gladly put a card down to secure a tab. Where they could have made more money, Spago chose to lose a number of customers who not only were willing to pay, but were willing to pay as much as necessary to enjoy our evening. All because of a waitress could not ask the appropriate questions and an inexperienced Manager who handled the situation quite poorly.  In my almost two decades of traveling on business, this was my first experience where an establishment didn't understand business travelers and expense accounts.  Not a very good experience for your brand, Wolfgang."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,22-Mar-19,I came twice. Lunch/dinner were both delicious. Our waiter was very attentive and recommended things from the menu. There cocktails are even more amazing. Had a nice view and place was beautiful.
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,22-Mar-19,"You think Spago is beyond over and it's this dusty relic from the past, but I was so happy with my experience. Unbeatable location with views of the crazy MBS pool and the surrounding city. Lovely ambiance and very spacious inside too. Excellent service - attentive and friendly. Drinks in Singapore are so pricey (especially at and around MBS), and given those circumstances, they have one of the best happy hours. The drinks are delicious and so is the food. I could come here everyday for a drink, some spring rolls, and chicken karaage and be happy. Seriously though, I'm a seasoned international drinker, and the cocktails here and the other Wolfgang Puck restaurant, Cut, are some of the best I've ever had."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,18-Dec-15,"Love it here.  Spago opened up very recently atop Marina Bay Sands, overlooking the badass infinity pool. This is Wolfgang Puck's marquee restaurant brand and I am beyond excited they opened it at this location in Singapore. I've been to the ones in LA (My mother's favorite), Las Vegas and Hawaii in the past and always very much enjoyed their great service and impeccable food. In addition to those three, they also have restaurants in Colorado and Istanbul which all have unique ingredients that make each Spago restaurant very different from each other. Spago Singapore is also innovative in its own way and you will see this immediately when receiving the menu to find ""Kaya Toast"", Pan Seared Alaska Halibut ""Laksa"", and Steamed Salmon ""Hong Kong Style"" on their menu.  I've been to this restaurant once and their lounge on numerous occasions for date nights and friends gatherings and this place really can't be beat for a late night open-air lounge feel. After a few drinks, I had a momentary setback to thinking I was in LA or Miami.  But let's start with restaurant side:  You walk into a door that reminded me of The French Laundry in Napa and feel completely away from the MBS setting. Total class all around from the moment you sit down and are offered water.  The food and service are outstanding. Spago calls itself a Californian cuisine restaurant (which I've always felt means the kind of food you would eat while kicking back and drinking wine) and we actually had a waiter from California serve our table which was pretty cool.  My girlfriend and I ordered the following:  1) Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones - This is Spago's staple starter across all of his restaurants. Every part of it is fresh, even the cones are handmade in the Spago kitchen. SO GOOD!  2) Hand Cut Agnolotti with White Truffle - So good we got two orders of it. Fresh agnolotti pasta with a generous portion of white truffle. SO GOOD!  3) I ordered the Grilled Sonoma Lamb Chops - These were incredible and perfect for the Insignia wine that we ordered. :)  4) My girlfriend ordered the Honey Miso Broiled Japanese Black Cod which she loved as well.  We unfortunately were too full for dessert but will opt for it next time around.  I would highly recommend doing a dinner here for whatever occasion, solid food that you can expect great quality from.  For the lounge:  I've been here many times now and love every bit of it. This is the first lounge in Singapore that I feel operates the way a lounge should - great wine and drinks, great bar snacks/food, great music, great service in a very comfortable and airy environment. It is run very efficiently and they hire good people to take great care of you. Come here for even one beer and you'll see that you can just let your hair down and enjoy yourself, something I find a rarity in with Singapore drinking culture. It truly feels like they brought in an LA or Miami type classy casual spot into Singapore and totally nailed it.  They have the Big Eye Tuna Tartare Cones here so make sure to get those while sipping one of their delicious cocktails. The sliders and langoustine are very good. The California Roll uses real crab and is very delicious despite a more expensive price tag. And for the sweet tooths out there, they serve a really good Halo Halo dessert.  THEY ARE OPEN LATE AFTER MIDNIGHT TOO!  Totally check this place out. Very highly recommend for a solid date night cocktail or a casual hangout with friends."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,1,25-Feb-16,"This review is for the Bar and Bistro Area Only. Usherettes that welcome you to the Bar are only concerned about getting you in. Any special requests such as getting bar seats will not be entertained. Rude and stuck up. She basically hijacked us as soon as the the 57th Floor elevator door opened. Not happy with the service from this stand point. Cocktails were made soooo slow and we waited for 20 mins, granted it was busy and the male server apologised, it was interesting to see that the people in work suits were given their beers and other drink orders before us when we were seated way before these people. Not Happy, Never coming back here again. It's a shame because compared to the fine dining area this is area has dropped the ball on A Thursday night."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,30-Apr-19,"Well, the conference was finally over and I had some time to relax. After spending some time in the pool it was time to try Spago. I sat at the bar area and had a spicy tuna and grilled octopus appetizer. They were both quite tasty. The service was great as well. The price is well, as you'd expect it...pricey for the phenomenal location. I'd go back if I find myself in Singapore again."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,15-Nov-15,"Reminds me of my home back in LA :) went here for drinks and it was amazing. Great view, great weather, great service, great drinks and finger food and dessert. Had the tuna tataki cones, fried chicken, grilled cheese sandwich, and my girlfriends had the mochi waffles which were supposed to be really good. I had the first cocktail on the menu, super light and refreshing. Service was really top notch. Every time I used a napkin and put it on the table, it vanished. Whenever water was half empty, it was filled up right away. This is the kind of service that I think Singapore needs. Anyway, trying their dinner tonight for my brother in law's birthday. Will keep you updated, but highly recommend for drinks and finger food! And probably do dinner for big celebrations :)"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,13-Dec-16,"Really amazing place. Be sure to come earlier in the evening and grab a drink at the outdoor poolside bar (infinity pool) before to take in the stunning views of Singapore. Amazing service. Amazing food. Amazing ambience.  And more importantly amazing sommelier. We spent about ¡ê1,500 for three persons (because of the wine mainly) and that's because the sommelier called up his buddies at various other places to get us exactly the wines/vintages we wanted. Great service.  Magical evening!"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,22-Jan-18,"Amazing food, amazing ambiance, beautiful views. Its cloud 9! I loved the tuna cones, spring rolls, yummy bread sticks, pasta was delicious, everything we ordered was amazing. I would love to come again."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,30-Nov-18,"Just left the buffet as a guest of marina bay sands. As an upgrade to my stay I have this restaurant included in my breakfast buffet selection. This is definitely a nice breakfast place, love the pool and ambience, food was good but the service is Amazing. We had an older Chinese lady helping us and she was great, spoke Chinese to my wife as I tried to give her a nice tip for taking care of us, she rejected and said as long as we had a great time she's happy. Where can u find that in America or Asia? Overall will be back when we stay here again next year."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,5-May-17,Food good... view good...service good...very recomended..you need reserve the table ..
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,23-Jul-18,The food was alright. Nothing to really rave about given that it is a fusion and they don't particularly specialize in anything. Although I have to say that the decor and ambience is romantic. Would be amazing to take a love one out and enjoy the view.
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,27-Oct-18,"Herm¨¨s is the best bartender in Singapore. Espresso martinis, old fashion, you name it. Haven't had a better experience. Worth going just for him to make you a drink"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,5-Jun-17,"I first went to Spago in Beverly Hills over 20 years ago, and back then, it was the place to be and quite a scene. Flash forward to 2017 and it's interesting to walk into Spago again but in Singapore and atop MBS at that. Given the extreme difference in the setting and city, though, Spago has done a great job of bringing the SOCal concept to Singapore. Starting from the interior, I love the clean modern rustic space and of course the views (something the LA location doesn't have)! The menu is all Spago as well, which means fusion cooking. Lunch is a great deal here as well at $45 for 3 courses. Some of my favorite dishes here are the tuna tartare cones (so delicious!), the bincho grilled salmon served with Korean banchan which reminded me of a play on bibimbap, and also a very satisfying burger. Service is solid, but again, I wish we had better options for American wines. Definitely one of my favorite places at the moment!"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,14-Jun-18,"We were fortunate enough that we were able to snag an early reservation here as it seems to book up quite quickly. Eating from the 57th floor is amazing, and really shows off how Singapore is a major port as you look out the windows and see a city of boats anchored offshore.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is pleasant as its very sophisticated, yet relaxed that you aren't afraid if you following etiquette to a T.  The prices here are higher as you'd expect as you are eating in the Hotel/Casino establishment, just like you'd expect in Las Vegas.  The food was phenomenal. The Singapore touch of spices and seasoning was delectable on the classic Snapper Laksa. Our desserts and appetizers were also very tasty.  We did fall for the sparkling or flat water technique, but they do have tap water if you ask for it.  Overall, if you don't want to venture out of the hotel and only want to take the elevator ride up, I would definitely recommend this place."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,2-Aug-16,"I can't think of a better word this fantastic!  Food, Wine and Service was awesome!  Will definitely go again!"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,17-Apr-17,Stunning view over Singapore. The food was also very good. You need to reserve a table in advance since the place is very crowded.
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,1,1-Feb-18,"(Caveat: I have not yet eaten here but will update my review after dinner tonight) As a paying guest of the Marina Bay Sands Hotel, I walked up from the infinity pool to make my reservation for dinner. Prior to making the reservation, I was asked if I wanted to see the menu first - apparently the hostess wanted me to see the prices before hand. I can only assume, because she did not ask anyone else in line the same question, it's because I'm an African-American woman. We TOO have money to spend. Obviously Spago staff needs sensitivity training."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,2,27-Feb-18,"Recently went here for a valentines date. Just dreadful, Super sweet cocktails, intermittent bar service, bite size over priced bar snacks, like 30 dollars for three slices of the fattiest pork belly you have ever seen. Absolutely disgusting, we could not eat eat it... Only saving grace was a couple of free glasses of Prosecco because the service was so slow. Sweet was nice but 180 dollars later, it was a very good reminder on why we don't usually go to MBS."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,3,8-Jul-16,"This is a rating for the bar (not restaurant): Amazing views of the Singapore naturally on East side. Lots of pool goers walking past on the West side. Good place to people watch all day and night because the pool is packed right up until people are forced out at around 11pm. Reason for the lower rating is due to the cocktail staff. Super friendly and accommodating, but a little pushy on their agenda for drinks. Seemed like they were needing to use up their gin. Many cocktail waitresses came from Russia (kinda random I know)."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,11-May-16,"You pay for the views. I had lunch here by myself at the bar. Service was attentive since it wasn't really crowded. At night, a different story. The lobster Cobb salad is actually filling, nice size portion. Again, great for the views and a big bank account."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,2,17-Aug-19,Definitely mediocre. Pre-cooked underseasoned lobster in the S$44 lobster Cobb. Nice view does not quite make up for it.
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,4,8-Jan-19,"Great view at the top of the Marina Bay Sands hotel! I had my favorite spicy ahi poke cones and they did not disappoint! Very good quality although quite pricey ($32 for California roll ) hence the 4 star review. It is though, a Wolfgang Puck restaurant, so it is expected to be expensive, but it was overall very good!"
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,20-Nov-16,"By far the best burger I've ever had. One can't really imagine anyone messing up a burger, but they got it so right. And then we got the ice cream sandwich for dessert and I was amazed how good that was also."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,2,10-Jan-17,"This review is for the bar, not for the restaurant. My friends and I went here on our last night to have some celebratory dinner and drinks to the end of an amazing vacation! Greeted by the hostesses at the front we were not asked if we were there for dinner or just drinks and were quickly ushered to a table in the bar area. Without knowing it was only an appetizer menu we ordered a few things. I had the potstickers which were absolutely delicious. The flavor was perfect and the sauce very good as well. When delivered to our table we were shocked at the size (as we were still thinking it was dinner). Our waitress (Nadezda) did nothing to make this a great experience. She did not offer to explain the drink or food menu, only came back to the table to collect the dirty plates and bring us the bill. For a restaurant that is owned by someone as prestigious as Wolfgang Puck I would expect both the food and service to be top notch. Our waitress Nadezda was one of the most rude, stuck up and overall worst waitresses I have ever had. Her overall bad attitude and terrible service greatly impeded us from having a wonderful time. If you go here just keep this in mind."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,10-Feb-18,"Fantastic food, awesome atmosphere and great service! The Manager is the best and she made our night just by making us feel important. I recommend you make this a priority the next time you're in Singapore."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,3,8-Jun-17,"If I were only rating the food and service it would be 5 stars. If you are going for the view don't bother. The restaurant is surrounded by the pool. We did. Not enjoy seeing bathers as we dined at such a nice restaurant. It took a lot away from the experience. We were looking forward to seeing the light show below after dinner only to be told we could not have access to the rest of the area outside of the restaurant. Not cool after a $400 meal... Lastly, we had a hard time figuring out how to get there. 3 different elevators that were not labeled well and we were not guests of the hotel so not sure we would have had access to even get there if not for a friendly employee in the elevator that swiped his key card for us. Great food but the atmosphere is totally over rated. Also, the reason I chose this place was because of the menu and when we arrived we found that the menu had been changed and not updated online."
Spago By Wolfgang Puck,4.1,91,American,5,5-May-16,OMG! The best meal I have had in my life thus far!! My husband and I booked this restaurant a month in advance. The food was knock your socks off good!! Every bite was an explosion of flavors in your mouth. The staff was very tentative and we had a wonderful experience!! Thank you for making our time there special!!
Grain Traders,4.1,12,Cafes,4,21-Oct-15,"Delicious.. BUT EXPENSIVE!  I really don't understand. Does eating lunch in CBD has to be this expensive? I know there are bankers and lawyers but there are also underpaid consultants (aka me) and also others who earn a decent salary for a living. I call this pure indulgent eating here, and can only do it once a while.  That being said, Grain Traders serves really good, fresh food. I enjoyed my food here tremendously. It definitely reminds of the fuss- free, health-conscious restaurants you get in Australia or the US. The concept is the same like The Daily Cut, you can either order set meal called ""Hero Bowls"" or DIY your own lunch. Same price at $16 nett. Hero Bowls section comes in 6 choices but since I was hangry (read: hungry + angry), i head straight to the DIY section. For the price you get to choose:  1 grain (quinoa, brown rice, japanese rice, or soba) 1 protein (beef, salmon or chicken) 1 hot vege (various items to choose from) 2 cold vege (various salads, kimchis etc) 1 topping (no, im not talking about rainbow sprinkles or m&ms here) 1 sauce (you MUST MUST try the MISO CARAMEL sauce!!)  ........................and you get a bowl of wholesome meal.  There;s also a coffee bar on the other side of the restaurant that serves decent coffee at the price you get from 'bucks. I got myself a cup of latte and it was pretty good, at $5.50.  I spent a total of $21.50 of lunch today, which is equivalent to almost 3 plates of normal mixed rice from the hawker center. Will i come back, yes. Maybe once every fortnight. Or else I might have to get a bank loan to eat here daily.  Lunch crowd (12-1pm) tends to get overwhelming so come really early or late to avoid the madness. Service is prompt and efficient overall!  p/s: The miso caramel sauce is as good as the maple butter syrup from clinton st bakery. I can drink it on its own, I swear"
Grain Traders,4.1,12,Cafes,4,6-Feb-17,"One of my favorite breakfast/lunch places when I wanted something healthy in Singapore!  For breakfast, I've had their polenta and oatmeal. They give you two 2-3"" circular pieces of grilled polenta with greens, beans, and avocado. For oatmeal, it's a big hearty scoop with delicious toppings. Oatmeal's a little bit on the sweeter side but what I loved about it was how sticky it was. Both are $8 SGD which is a little bit pricey but totally worth it.  For lunch, I usually make my own bowl. I've had their tuna, salmon, and chicken as protein with toppings such as apple kimchi, beans, and roasted veggies. For dressing, their beetroot feta yogurt, wasabi, and coconut curry were my favorites. All the ingredients are super fresh. I also love their concept- it's healthy with unique flavors! The only thing I wished they offered was giving the option of doing half greens and grains for the base (you can only get salad only or noodles/rice only).  Service is super quick (even during peak hours) as it is in the hustle and bustle area of CBD. Definitely recommend this place to anyone in Singapore who is looking for something healthy and hearty!"
Grain Traders,4.1,12,Cafes,4,11-Jul-17,"Let me make it clear, I am only taking off one star because of the price, as other people mentioned, of the bowls and drinks. As everyone says, the quality is there, but for lunch, it may be too pricey for an every day occasion.  HOWEVER, I did want to review something that most people don't think of when they think of Grain Traders: THE BAGEL SANDWICHES. Only $10 and you get: a bagel, a protein, a spread, a veggie, and something extra. I always get their plain bagels toasted (they only have 2 types of bagels unfortunately), with jalapeno cream cheese, cured salmon, avocado, and spinach. ALL THAT FOR JUST $10! Great deal! The only sad part is that breakfast is only available 8am-10:30am. Booooo. I want bagels for dinner!"
Grain Traders,4.1,12,Cafes,5,21-Jan-16,"This will put a dent in your wallet, but once it touches your lips, it's just so good!  I understand the appeal. In CBD, tons of people want healthier options, and this is definitely one of them. There are a lot of choices here, and possibilities seem endless.  I'm usually the type who'd rather just choose whatever combos they offer, but none of them really appealed to me so I went the custom bowl route.  You get to choose from lots of different grains, proteins, and veggie add-ons. Everything I chose tasted great: the charred corn, striploin steak, pickled capsicums, and the bean pico de gallo. Additionally you can choose a sauce, and that in itself took me a while because there was a lot and I wanted to try so many!  Depending on what you get it could be $15-20. For Singapore, that's a pretty expensive lunch.  To beat the crowd, you seriously have to go between 11-11:45, because once 12 comes around the queue spans the entire restaurant and there are no seats available.  Enjoy your healthy lunch! I, on the other hand, just need to learn how to make all of these ingredients at home so I can assemble myself!"
Grain Traders,4.1,12,Cafes,4,19-Jan-17,"Simple, good food that's also healthy fast food!  The menu hasn't changed since they first opened, which is a good sign - it's not an F&B outlet that follows the latest food trends.  A little on the pricey side, but your body will thank you, trust me! Satisfying meals every time I visit, and pretty good (attentive) service too!"
Grain Traders,4.1,12,Cafes,5,9-Oct-17,"Delicious healthy lunch option that you'll thoroughly enjoy eating. Every time I visit SG, I retreat to Grain Traders to cleanse a bit after a few days of extensive hawker center food."
Grain Traders,4.1,12,Cafes,4,2-Aug-17,"This is my new favorite lunch place! The food and coffee are both above par, and I love the variety of healthy and colorful food options."
Grain Traders,4.1,12,Cafes,1,6-Sep-16,"What's with the attitude here, ladies? Grain Traders must have the shittest service in Singapore, hands down. Not a single smile and really curt replies when we ask questions. It wasn't even at peak lunch hour. And I thought it was just me, maybe I had too many questions since it was my first time, but my two other girlfriends had the same treatment. There wasn't anyone in line after me at 2pm. Ok, maybe they were tired from lunch service. The quinoa was yummy. The beef ok... For the same price I could get just as yummy a salad without the bitchiest attitude from the whole bunch of staff. Not cool, Grain Traders!"
Grain Traders,4.1,12,Cafes,4,14-Oct-15,"Great food, crazy lunch crowd on a weekday (avoid if you wanna get seats) healthy eating never tasted so good. love the idea of the buffet line- the colors of the vegetables against great serving plates are clever. $16 for a bowl of hearty healthy portion. not cheap on the wallet but then again, we're in the CBD area. I will come back again"
Grain Traders,4.1,12,Cafes,5,24-Apr-16,"Love, love, love this place. I could probably eat it every day, for realz.  Although I'd then be broke, but I'd be healthy, so what's more important?  Anyway, my work people rave about GT all day every day, so I thought let me go see what all the fuss is about. I ordered the upstream which was really really good. The dressing was the real star, and although when you look at the amount of food you are getting, you start to panic, but you'll be full. I promise. You can also make your own salad, or bowl, or whatever, but they have some pretty good ones already put together. The second one I tried had chicken, and more of a Mexican feel, but the upsteam was def. better. For a meal, snack and water will run you $16. Not cheap, but def. worth it. I saw they also do breakfast, and have some interesting stuff going on, so looking forward to go when I have a free minute to spare in the AM. Perfect for those who work in the CBD and need a quick, healthy lunch, or live in the area and need something after a work out, or on the way home from a late night at the office."
Grain Traders,4.1,12,Cafes,4,5-Feb-19,Food is good but very expensive starting at $16 per bowl. The food has a lot of flavor and tastes healthy. Long but fast line during lunch time. Unfortunate that they don't provide water to their customers and cafe will not let you have tap water.
Grain Traders,4.1,12,Cafes,5,1-Feb-16,"Obsessed with this place! My husband took me for lunch today and I forgot to take pictures of the food, but I had the steak and salmon bowls to share. Coffee was alright but the juices were delicious. Definitely recommend, but seating is limited and it's super packed during lunch hours. Still, people don't eat for more than 15 mins on a busy work week so turnover is not slow. Steak is more filling and salmon is healthier. Husband said he also tried the pork which was good. I can't wait to try the rest of the menu. Will come during non peak hours since I'm in school anyway and don't have a set lunch time. Too bad they don't have one near my school (INSEAD) otherwise they would sell out so quick! Maybe do a pop up for a month or something. Anyway, right now daily cut and salad stop are the only healthy options. And class ends late so it would be nice if healthy options are open, not just bar food. Anyway, go and eat healthy here!"
SKIRT,3.9,9,"Seafood, Steakhouses",5,12-Aug-22,"Excellent date night restaurant in Sentosa cove area. Exquisite wagyu steak- esp the Japanese Tochigi A5 wagyu is flavorful melt in mouth marbling. Totally worth $165 for 220g vs $140 Australian Tajima Wagyu Ribeye 300g (MBS 4-5) excellent steak but not as unforgettable as the A5. For red wine, recommend the Chateau Simatd Grad Cru 2012 from Saint-Emilion France which pairs nicely.  Ps: gorgeous company is definitely more unforgettable than A5. (Added by date)"
SKIRT,3.9,9,"Seafood, Steakhouses",4,14-Dec-18,"If you have an amex platinum card, this restaurant offers 50% discount on dining for 2 adults (33% for 3 adults, 25% for 4 adults, etc). The only requirement was that each diner had to order a main course.  Amuse bouche was a delightful steak tartare which was well seasoned and tasty. They also served warm bread, which never fails to delight.  Truffle Burrata - this was delicious and large enough to share. The burrata was extremely creamy. Must try!  My friend and I tried the Wagyu skirt steak (signature) and their Wagyu rib eye (daily special). We preferred the skirt steak to the rib eye as it had a little more marbling and was a lot more flavorful. The rib eye wasnt bad though!  We had a side of broccolini as well so which helped to balance out the red meat. Oh, and we were served a palate cleanser before our main dish as well - a refreshing apple juice with a dash of whiskey.  Service was excellent and we had a great time. Price point is on the higher side, but with the 50% discount, it made the meal pretty worth it!"
SKIRT,3.9,9,"Seafood, Steakhouses",5,13-Oct-17,"Came here the day after we got married as I was craving steak; skirt really delivered the best steak I've had since NZ! They take walk in as well as telephone reservations.  Ambience was nice and cosy. Waitstaff were extremely attentive and hospitable.  Would definitely recommend getting the higher grade of wagyu skirt steak with their red wine sauce!  Price point is definitely on the higher end, so come here only if you're prepared to spend"
SKIRT,3.9,9,"Seafood, Steakhouses",4,29-May-16,"We had dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant is not very big, and you get plenty of service, but the attention is not overwhelming.  The server brought around a tray of raw steaks for us to peruse, and it was helpful for deciding. My husband decided to go with one of their wagyu ribeye cuts. I selected the chicken from the Mains since I can't eat aged meats.  We were served a little amuse-bouche with our bread. A salmon puff, which tasted like smoked salmon, with lots of dill. The puff itself was a little dry. It was okay. I wasn't a fan of the bread -- it's the lighter type of Asian bread, and I prefer the denser and softer European style ones. The bread was served with chorizo oil, which was extremely aromatic and was surprisingly not salty or spicy at all (I'm not sure I tasted anything), and an artichoke dip which was mild and chilled.  We selected the confit duck leg for appetizer, and it was surprisingly large. It came with a softboiled egg, and root vegetables, which the chef recommended we mixed before eating. The duck flavor was strong and salty, and I couldn't really taste anything else. I probably wouldn't get this again.  We also got the nashi pear and beetroot salad to share. As a woman, I felt that the salad and the appetizer were large enough to make a meal. I like to do this to make the meal more interesting. I loved the salad -- it had a complex and light flavor, small sweet crunchy bits of pear, and a different harder crunch of salty pickles diced very very finely with a good goat cheese (not too salty) with iceberg lettuce. The dish was very well balanced.  We were given a juice-alcohol drink as a palate cleanser before the mains arrived, which I thought was a nice touch.  My husband's steak had a good char, on par with the Vegas steakhouses, and was excellent. The one thing I thought that could be improved was that different parts of the steak was done to different degrees. The steak came with salt, BBQ and bearnaice sauce on the side, but it was flavorful enough that the condiments were unnecessary.  My chicken was just ok. I would have preferred a little more salt, and maybe have it a little less done (it was a little dry). The spatzle was given sparingly as a little burst of intense and delightful flavor, mixed among the sauteed mushrooms and baby spinach.  We couldn't resist ordering the garlic fries, which were very garlicky and delicious without being greasy.  The restaurant gave us a light chocolate fudge dessert since we were celebrating our anniversary. It was delicious -- chocolately and just sweet enough without being overwhelming. Given how much food we had for dinner, it would have been easy to feel overwhelmed by the dessert.  While the meal was not cheap, it was value for money. There are too many restaurants that overcharge for boring meals cooked poorly in Singapore, fancy hipster areas like Keong Saik Road run by cooks (not chefs). Skirt delivered interesting tastes and good quality food at the same price point. Unfortunately it's a little out of the way on Sentosa Island, so I'll be trying other steakhouses on the mainland."
SKIRT,3.9,9,"Seafood, Steakhouses",5,11-Jun-13,"Service - second opinion not required - it has been very gracious, warmth and attentive. Constantly, the floor team will walk to my table to ask about meal experience. Although I appreciate that gesture, less is more for me. That's not to conclude that they flawed being too personal, and I applauded their professionalism. They took every single constructive feedback seriously and take pride in their work, from floor to kitchen. I could sense their remarkable sincerity.  Skirt has a medium-large space area - a spacious dining room, booth and crescent leather sofa seats), a more cozy booth seats glued next to the bar counter right in front of its alfresco exit. A mixture of table, booth (lesser in number), crescent leather sofa seats set the room, while I love to see Sous Chef and cooks behind their stove but the heat fanning across the grill units towards the booth seats has been comfortable. I swap for a crescent sofa next to the bar counter which was a lot more cozy.  The Saffron Potato Puree failed to arouse me, rather, I ended up feeling greasy and bloating with carb-starving syndrome with only 2 small helping. The potato was deeply buttered (I could see ""watering"" above the puree in the serving pot), totally weighed me down. It has been heavily salted which I never liked. The texture was smooth but very very thick, something I have never encounter in my years of potato puree which are mostly velvety and light without a gummy-liked consistency. The beetroot is another one that I ordered by mistake. The seasoning was fine except for the earthy flavour that turned hostile against me.  On the consolation, the freshly baked focaccia buns were so delightfully chewy and fluffy in the middle. 3 ways of eating it; first dribble a few drops of Chorizo Oil playfully stored in a dropper glass onto the tear out bun and taste the mild spiciness in each bite. If u have eaten Chorizo, u should be familiar with its taste and this oil extraction is less briny and not too spicy in comparison. Then another way of eating will be dipping the bread morsels in the ""greenish freak"" - Seaweed Sauce. It has a intense oceanic flavour, smell like some sort of an oyster yet a very raw seaweed plus a tangy note. Upon checking, the chef has an added anchovies to the sauce and that qualify for the fishiness scent. Skip this condiments if visiting to the wet-market is a ""rather-to-die"" experience for u.  It's about time to reveal the best at skirt - a Tajima (Japanese) Australian Crossbred Wagyu - prized cattle that u never want to miss when u meet Skirt the first time. I read about it and arrived in pursuit of its goodness. Excellent taste; beefy but not overtly rich. It hits my soft spot with its balanced marbling and tenderness along with a light traces of salt that was used in the beef ageing process (negligible). The texture in my medium rare piece is a marvel; springy and juicy, no doubt the dry ageing technique has evaporate most of its moisture. No steak sauces are required but u could request for a few to experiment them.  Blackmore Australian Full Blood 9+ Wagyu is one that arrives in a higher concentration of fats which scattered around, not uniformed. We had it cooked medium-rare, and it lends a ultra chewiness that are somewhat jaw tiring by mid way. I couldn't appreciate the way it overpowers my palate, it was way too rich and greasy though the meat is tender and soft. If such a consistency is true in every occurrence, then I find it not worth enjoying. I'd rather fork out $26 more for a more harmonious taste.  All the meat has been aged dry at Skirt in their specially built drying cabinet except for the Irish variant -21days aged, imported. The lot could only last for a month at most!  A must try - Braised Duck Leg, Golden Raisins, Cured Bacon. The portion is good for one if u intend to go without side orders or even for sharing. Memorable flavour, robust duck fragrance that was fork-tender under the braising technique, jus coating that wowed me in hint of sweetness and a gentle bacon saltiness. Truly, this one here has not had any wild gamey taste. The grilled leeks, fennels, baby carrot brightened up the plate and makes a good sides.  Torched Honey Meringue topped their order list and I hear them. Indeed, the feather light foamy meringue shines in its lovely honey note, covered with desiccated coconut. Separated by a soft pineapple jelly, the bottom layer is a silky cold cream (not coconut ice cream as reviewed by some) with a hidden pineapple REAL fruit slice, FROZEN! Very light & cooling. I love it much."
SKIRT,3.9,9,"Seafood, Steakhouses",2,2-Oct-17,I had two meals here - both dinner - the only dish that wowed me was the ribeye - all else was marginal due to faulty execution of what for some dishes was an inventive and promising concept.  I am giving this 2 stars for meal relative to price point. Be prepared to spend at least $125 US per person if you include wine (likely more). Oh and if you love bread you will be extremely disappointed.
SKIRT,3.9,9,"Seafood, Steakhouses",5,11-May-14,"Fantastic steak. Fantastic service. Fantastic time. What else do I need to come back again?  The staff by the name of Nigel is the best. Friendly, gave me good advice on the wine selection and steak selection."
SKIRT,3.9,9,"Seafood, Steakhouses",3,25-Dec-13,"We went there for Christmas eve, and instead of the regular menu, they had a four course Christmas special menu. No other option.  The ambience is great, the food is really well prepared and presented, but it lacks two basic qualities of a great steakhouse: Large cuts of aged beef, and good wine. The Christmas menu had only one bite size tasting of beef. This is unacceptable for a steakhouse. What's worst, the wine pairing was just disappointing (the $48 price for 3 glasses should have been a big signal that this was not going well)! This place lost a full star on the wine choice for the pairing alone.  I look forward to go back on an evening when the regular menu is available."
SKIRT,3.9,9,"Seafood, Steakhouses",2,6-Dec-14,"I will start off with the positive aspects of SKIRT. The food and atmosphere at SKIRT is reasonably good. I loved their bread with chorizo oil and artichoke dip. And the lobster and crab cake starters were tiny but very yummy. Steaks were reasonably good but this is a steak house so if the steaks were crappy then it would just be sad. However for the price point that they are charging, their service (or lack thereof) is rather appalling. Someone needs to look at how the restaurant is run as we have noticed that there are some staff who seem overworked and some who are just swanning around. And I try to be patient when I know that the staff are overworked and busy. But it is just infuriating to know that this place can be so much better if some of their staff just got their act together. I won't go back to SKIRT as there are better places (better steak and better service) at this price range (Cut! Ftw!). SKIRT, you have been disappointing."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,5,9-Nov-23,You know a place is good when your parents praise it. The chili crab isn't overly spicy but still has a good kick to it. We also enjoyed the other dishes like fried rice that had plenty of "wok breath." The dessert we had was the osmanthus and goji berry cakes. Very well done with plenty of texture and decent size to take a few bites.
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,4,10-Dec-19,"This branch of red house seafood is located on the second floor of the Grand Copthorne hotel. I came here for a work dinner and we ordered the set menu. The food here is quite good and overall I enjoyed my meal. If you are looking for chili crab, I think there are better places.  Food: 3.75 stars Service/environment: 3.5 stars Overall: 3.5 stars Recommendations: spicy seafood combination, braised spinach tofu, chilled mango pomelo with sago  The best thing here is the spicy seafood combination. The seafood includes scallops, fish, shrimp, and squid. The luscious curry sauce is really tasty and a tad bit spicy. This is a must order here.  The other dish I had here that I really liked was the braised spinach tofu. The tofu itself is deep fried with a egg based coating. The tofu is braised in a brown sauce and topped with mushrooms and conpoy. Tasty dish and executed well.  The crispy chicken here is also quite good. Not really my favorite dish in general but the version at red house is quite good. Chicken is nice and moist and well seasoned.  The chili crab here was a bit disappointing. I am not the biggest fan of the chili sauce here and would suggest going somewhere else for this dish. I think the black pepper crab is better.  The groupa served in boiling oil and soya was also a bit of a disappointment. This preparation is something I have grown up eating and really love. The fish however, was over cooked and the fish meat was a bit dry. The sauce work was good but the cooking of the fish was off."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,4,31-Aug-19,The Red House is a go to place when showing visitors Robertson Quay. This is a great family style option in a much chiller part of town. It provides a great low key vibe after long days.  The food is your basic look at a picture and order situation. So many dishes to try in both a large and small sizes. The wait staff is helpful and patient with ordering although they will try to get you to order the most expensive dishes.  Great place to try something new but make a reservation if eating here on a weekend. Gets crowded quickly..
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,5,21-Nov-15,"Best Singapore Spicy Chili Crab EVER. Five Stars!  I ate at this restaurant TWO times in the 5 day trip to Singapore. Get the spicy chili crab here or you will be sorry. The crab is cooked with a chilisauce that taste like sambal + garlic + fish sauce. To Die For! I ordered the Scottish (something) crab, which cost about SD$97 for a medium sized crab.  Don't forget to order a bowl of rice and a few buns to sop up all the gravy.  Food Grade: A+ Service Grade: A+ Worth the Money Grade: A+ Overall Impression Grade: A+"
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,4,28-Jul-16,"Oh my I love the food here ...... chance upon this restaurant when my guest is staying at Park Hotel Clarke Quay.  We have an awesome meal with a great selection of seafood. We book a table on a weekend evening and the place is so full with people. It's really crowded, didn't know that this restaurant is so popular among the locals and i see some tourist and expat.  The ambience was good and it's located right to the end of Robertson Quay. We have made a pre-booking few days back. Luckily we book the table otherwise we would need to have a long wait.  The staff got us seated to our table and menu was given to us and everything was in place so smoothly.  Our bill was around $600+ and we ordered quite a fair bit of seafood and it was so fresh.  I give an overall rating of 4/5 for the food:  Bamboo Clams Cereal Prawn Fried Fish Spinach Toufu Seafood Fried Rice Spinach with 3 eggs  I can't list down the price for each individual items as this is paid by the guest. I find this quite a good place to host your guest but I'm not how's the pricing as comparable to other seafood restaurant like Jumbo."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,5,15-May-16,"I am always on the hunt to find good dim sum. I heard about Red House (RH) from numerous friends and saw posts on social media, so I decided to give it a try since it's also been around for 40 years. Located on the corner street of Robertson quay area, RH is one of the most modern looking dim sum restaurants I've ever been to! The d¨¦cor is simple yet sophisticated; I can tell you that you won't be able to guess its age by looking at the ambience.  Let's talk about the food. I love that the menu has pictures. They don't have too many varieties just the staples. And I love all the basic dumpling choices they have for both steamed and fried.  They have your usual Har Gow, Siew Mai and they have some unique ones you usually don't see on a dim sum cart like the hand made signature Takesumi Chilli Crab Bao, NOW that is a MUST TRY!!!!! Honestly, everything on the dim sum list IS AMAZING.  Apart from dim sum, I love their braised spinach tofu and chili crab. The House Mee Goreng is worth to try as well. They also have a great beverage list (alcohol and non alcohol). The service is friendly, although can be really slow at times but the delicious food could make up for it.  I was stoked when I saw they have 40% discount for dim sum (like all dim sum, yes including the chili crab bao), which is valid until december 2016. Congrats on turning 40 Red House!"
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,3,21-Aug-16,"I guess the chili crab thing is just not for me. Or, maybe I am spoiled from the states. The chilling crab sauce was good. The crab was so so. Really, it if didn't have the sauce on it, it wasn't worth eating. I also added a cup of the shark cartilage soup. A very simple and good soup. From the food alone, I will not be returning.  I understand there is a huge markup for dining near the river. The prices here were abnormally high and the items I tried could not justify them."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,4,22-Jan-16,"Came here with a group for work, and because the group was big the meal was a pre-ordered, which normally makes me nervous. But everything in this pre-fixe came out was great, and dim sum style.  My favorite starter was a fried shrimp with a wasabi sauce on top, it was perfectly fried and the sauce gave it a spicy tang which fit perfectly. The chilli crab in the red house special chilli stew also did not disappoint with a perfect amount of spices. The seafood fried rice was a flavorful side and so were the small dinner rolls that were almost sweet and also a perfect side with all of the seafood we ate.  The mango Pomelo with sago dessert was a simple dessert that were not used to in the states but also delicious and sweet.  Great spot for my first trip to Singapore."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,4,14-May-17,"""Very Good""  Located right on the Singapore river. Our concierge suggested it over Jumbo Seafood.  Started with a Crispy Seafood Roll, very Good contained calamari and shrimp. My wife ordered the pumpkin seafood soup, also very good.  I had to order the house specialty, chili crab, enough for two and sold by weight. Not cheap at 83.60 Singapore dollars or about $ 67 US dollars. Definitely a must try dish in Singapore.  My wife ordered the prawns in a custard sauce with heads on, very Asian. She thought they were very good."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,5,8-Jun-17,"Went to eat here for dinner on 6/7 with a reservation for 7 people. Arrived early there and seated right away, the place is not packed compare to Jumbo seafood restaurant. Ordered signature Singaporean drink ""Singapore Sling"", calamari with salted egg, bamboo clam with garlic sauce, brown chilli crab, Taiwan grouper, sambal kangkong, mee goreng and seafood fried rice. Service was excellent, the staff was attentive, fast & friendly. Most importantly, the food was exceptional especially the calamari, clam, sambal kangkong and brown chilli crab, respectively. Those are in my opinion is a must have at Red House. The others were okay, nothing to brag about. The Singapore sling was too sweet for Asian's taste and weak on the alcohol. The restaurant can fit in quite a bit of people, nice atmosphere and clean. Will go back to eat here if I visit Singapore again."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,3,13-Oct-17,"Summary: Very good crab; reasonable, if expensive market prices; worth trying as a special occasion perhaps, but not worth going to regularly.  Upselling: They try to nickle and dime you for every little extra thing without asking: tea, napkins, nuts. So if you don't want something, make certain you say so before they bring it (or right when they bring it to the table).  The waitress recommended the Chili Crab using Alaskan King Crab as the most flavorful. The price wasn't too bad for Alaskan King; at 188 SGD per kilo* it's competitive with the market price in the USA. The downside is that the minimum order - even for one person - is 1.5 kilos.  Since I didn't expect to return to Singapore anytime soon, I decided to go all out. (And just to break up the flavor, I had a couple of steamed buns and a small side of custard prawns. I don't advise this. It's way too much food for one person.) Although the chili crab was very tasty, there can, indeed, be too much of a good thing. It would be better if they let solo diners order an appropriate amount for one person."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,1,15-Sep-17,"Overpriced for what it was. We ordered the salted egg yolk calamari in a small, prawns and brocolli in garlic and 2 cokes - $84!!! Food was quite underwhelming. I've had better at McDonald's. I definitely wouldn't go back."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,3,27-Nov-16,"Had a great dinner on a recent trip to Singapore. Walking Distance to the Four Points Sheraton where we stayed. This place is large with indoor and outdoor seating, but sorry, no air conditioning. They do have large fans inside that help, but it was hot when we were there and air conditioning would have been appreciated.  We did one of the combo dinners for two. My wife wasn't feeling well, so I ended up eating most of her meal... and I was still hungry (not a lot of food). I was somewhat surprised that it was about 100.00 per person and I thought it to be steep for what you get."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,5,25-Jul-19,Great food here. The spicy seafood combination is awesome.  The crispy duck and lobster are also very good. The service was good and they made good recommendations
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,1,8-Apr-19,"I honestly really enjoyed the food and the ambiance, especially since my girlfriend and I we're celebrating her birthday. They were very accommodating and even let us stay a little later to enjoy the birthday cake we brought. Now I'll get to the reason why I believe this place only deserves one star. Let's call it the pickled peanut and tea trick. Upon receiving the bill, I had noticed two additional charges for ""Pickle"" (which I then learned was the peanut dish) and another for ""Towel & Tea"". Basically they bring out these items to your table without you ordering them, letting customers assume that they are free items, which they then try and charge you for. We did not touch the peanuts or the tea, so I had asked them to remove the charges (To their credit, the charges were removed). The point is this; a well run establishment shouldn't play these types of games just to make a couple extra bucks from their customers. It's not good business practice and I'm sure over the years, they've fooled many unsuspecting customers. Long story short... Great food, shit business practice."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,4,25-Jul-18,Foods there are good except cooking is a bit too greasy to me as dinner in a summer night
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,4,3-Jan-18,"Very simple facility with the flare of a Chinese canteen; limited English speaking and way too bright lights inside. HOWEVER, the food is amazing. Sit outside in the evening where the lights are nice and dim. It's a charming location next to the river. Order the hot seafood combo plate. It will blow your mind. The small plates are designed for two people, and two, max. 3 small plates are plenty for two people. Definitely recommending this place."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,3,12-Aug-17,"We possibly made the mistake of ordering the set menu for two, which did include the chilli crab. The whole meal was underwhelming and extremely expensive. But...the part we were not happy about was the price we were asked to sign for at the conclusion of our meal. $98 x2 for set menu +$3.40 for the extra buns we ordered. Plus tea which we had not ordered but was instantly put on our table and poured in to our cups .. plus pickled peanuts , that were put on our table as we sat down and had not ordered by us, plus towels, amounting to $145ish We said we were not happy and the tea, peanuts, and towels, were quickly removed. We paid $234.90. We will not be returning."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,3,12-Feb-15,Ate here with friends. I thought chili crab was tasty. Steamed soy sauce fish was nicely done. Morning glory fried in garlic was okay. Did not like the crunchy baby squid appetizer. Use their one provided wet wipes for this messy eating. They could provide more wet wipes or have large table napkins. Used their sink near back of restaurant to wash sticky hands.
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,1,26-Feb-19,"Sooo overpriced. WORST service we've ever experienced. Be ready to shell out $300-$400 for 3 ppl of you want a normal meal. HUGE tourist trap, ashamed we fell for it. Steer clear."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,5,14-Sep-16,"Expensive but delicious. Tried it twice. Both types of crabs are awesome... as is the lobster. And for ""dessert"" get the cod - so buttery and glazed, almost like dessert. Highly recommend it. Costs about $100 per person if you go all out but definitely work it."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,5,9-May-16,"The best, freshest crabs ... this is The place to go. If you were to choose one place to have the famous Singaporean chili crab, this is it. We also had barbecued fresh shrimp,these were similarly succulent and sweet. Service was hyper-efficient, anything and everything you wanted. We had our 3 year old with us, who enjoyed the experience as much as we did. I didn't see any other toddlers there when we were there, but there was absolutely no problem with kids, this restaurant can take as much noise and as much laughter as you can give. Came out of the restaurant very full and very satisfied."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,5,28-Jul-15,It's really a nice seafood restaurant. The crab is so delicious. So is the small lobster. Good place for hanging out with a friend with a beer at the riverside place. Relaxing and have fun!
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,4,10-Sep-16,Incredible Spicy Seafood Combo. Make sure you get rice to soak up the sauce. Locals attend
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,3,12-Apr-16,"There are a few things in the menu that I would eat / order again. The pepper crab was good. The steamed fish was nice, and then prawns were OK. The rest was disgusting. The pork ribs was the worst I've ever had. The mushroom dish was chewy and horrible. There was an unidentifiable chewy shellfish(?) in there. The pasta had a very off taste."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,5,29-Jul-16,"We went for the set menu with crab and lobster, and it was fantastic. This restaurant well deserves the good reviews."
Red House,3.9,30,Seafood,4,4-Jan-14,"Hi everyone, took my children to Red House last night, for Chilli crab before end of Xmas holidays and before they fly back to stormy UK and start of 2014 University term. Was not disappointed, booked a table for 7.00pm as thIs is one of top places for Chilli Crab in Singapore and on last nights experience, much better than Jumbo. We had a mixed calamari starter platter, followed by their signature lobster coated in custard sweet sauce, very yummy, then a chilli crab and a black pepper crab and buns. Also ordered asparagus and greens. Service was very helpful, and reasonably priced for 4 wanting something a bit special and 3 hungry teenagers. My children really enjoyed the food and we had a great messy time with our fingers, which adds to the occasion. Will definitely return again. Only reason I have not scored this 5 stars is that I reserve this for a fine dining experience and special places. The red house is a special place for chilli crab and the sweet sauce, but it is a casual dinning experience, and a very good one."
Coriander Leaf,4.3,14,Asian Fusion,2,13-Jun-24,"I came to this place with a reservation for just myself and left feeling disappointed. When I came in, the staff sat me at a cramped, empty bar in the back that they were clearly using for storage rather than seating customers. They claimed they needed to ""find"" me a seat (which they never did), and this was odd as I had a reserved a table with them months in advance.  I ordered chicken momo with a tomato relish for my appetizer and cumin lamb for my main course, and while the presentation was nice, both items tasted bland and rather overcooked. For my dessert, I ordered avocado ice cream with melaka sago, and it was not as not as flavorful as I was expecting it would be.  Lastly, the service was okay, though when I ordered my dessert, it took the staff a strangely long time to bring it out compared to my appetizer and main. I was hoping to like this place thanks to its multicultural menu, so I'm disappointed by the food and service I received."
Coriander Leaf,4.3,14,Asian Fusion,5,18-May-19,"Came here for a team dinner and the service was really wonderful. Not rushed, not standoffish, friendly and at just the right pace  We had 4 courses and the food was really delicious ... a lot of variety, even from the amuse bouche to palate cleanser. I only took one photo as we were enjoying the company and food.  Bonus, this is located at the same place where the wedding in Crazy Rich Asians was filmed"
Coriander Leaf,4.3,14,Asian Fusion,4,14-Aug-20,What a surprise! Interesting fusion of Indian-Thai with a mix of Mediterranean Sea in there--like the watermelon salad. The jackfruit curry is amazing!  And the service was simply great... will come back for more!
Coriander Leaf,4.3,14,Asian Fusion,5,3-Aug-19,"This review is for a private party / cooking event. Twelve of us were divided into 3 teams. We were given a menu and ingredients and cooked/prepared the meal. The staff did a wonderful job of explaining what needed to be done and keeping the activity fun. At the end, the meal was delicious and everyone had a great time - including people that don't know how to cook."
Coriander Leaf,4.3,14,Asian Fusion,3,28-Mar-16,"The restaurant was started in 2001 in Gallery Hotel, before relocating to its current location. It offered Pan Asian cuisine with dishes from South Asia, China and Perisa. The restaurant was located at the second level, which both of us took quite sometimes to find the lift to bring us to the floor. The entrance was plain black looking.  Although it was noon time, the restaurant was quite dark as it was painted black all over. The brightest areas were the open concept kitchen and the tables by the wall.  For restaurant week, the restaurant offered a 4 course lunch set at $28++ per person. There was also a vegetarian lunch set too.  The staff could not find the reservation under my name and insisted there was no reservation even although I had showed him my booking conformation email from restaurantweek.sg. Although one could easily spot the customers in the restaurant were mostly under restaurantweek's reservations, he insisted that I had booked under a different website that was not by the restaurant. This made one felt so unwelcome, especially when the restaurant was less than a quarter full. After much exchange, we were showed to a poorly lighted table by the busy kitchen and walkway. I had asked to change to the one of the much well lighted tables by the wall, but was rejected with reason being I did not have a reservation. There was quite a number of unoccupied tables at the time.  For the first course, we were served  Marinated prawn salad, grated coconut It reminded one of the thai style green papaya salad but with a coconut taste.  Watermelon, mint, pomegranate, Turkish white cheese The sweet juicy watermelon was paired quite well with the strong tasted cheese.  For the second course, we were served  Steamed Venus clams, coconut water, tamarind The clams was small but juicy. The soup tasted quite unusual sweet and lacking of the savoury taste that one was expecting.  Spinach parcel, toasted pine nuts, yoghurt, browned butter It looked like mini sized boiled chinese style dumplings. The skin was not too thick and filling was quite juicy. It was quite unique with the yoghurt.  For the main course, we were served  Samia's signature frontier chicken, coriander seeds, chilli, yoghurt cream, arugula and butter naan The naan was soft and buttery. The chicken was juicy and tasted quite spicy. I wish that there was more yoghurt cream to combat the spicy taste.  Charcoal grilled vegetable kebab, butter rice, surmac, mint salad Interesting basmati rice was used for the butter rice. The rice was well cooked although I would prefer a stronger taste of butter in it. The vegetables was juicy with spicy curry powder taste.  Lastly for dessert, we were served Coconut sorbet, roasted pineapple salsa, Don Papa rum The sorbet did not taste like the usual sorbet. In fact it was more like a rich creamy coconut cream ice cream. The rum did wonders for the simple rich ice cream.  Overall the food seem to have more indian influence in it, based on the usage of ingredients and taste. Service was disappointing. There was no refill of plain water. As we were sharing, the staffs failed to take note to serve us serving plates. By the way we were sitting right in front of the open concept kitchen with a row of staffs staring at us."

Coriander Leaf,4.3,14,Asian Fusion,5,9-Oct-19,"My brother very thoughtfully got me a gift certificate for this restaurant for my husband and I to go while vacationing in Singapore. Unfortunately, we were not super familiar, so there was a misunderstanding in our part about calling ahead with the gift coupon etc. However, Monica was so professional and nice, she got us reserved for the next night and the food was incredible. It's totally worth buying this gift certificate for a 4 course meal, it was perfect, and we found ourselves wishing we had time or extra stomachs to try more of the menu! I'd suggest Coriander Leaf to anyone - the service alone sealed it for us, but the food, drinks and atmosphere were all impressive as well."
Coriander Leaf,4.3,14,Asian Fusion,5,24-Dec-18,Great service and very friendly staffs. Food is of top quality and taste good. Will come bacl again. Value for money.
Coriander Leaf,4.3,14,Asian Fusion,5,4-Apr-19,"Found this really awesome place based on a local friends recommendation. The service is outstanding, and the food is beyond outstanding. I had the lamb chops and my buddy had the young jackfruit. And the watermelon salad - all three were just mouth wateringly delicious. And chef Iskander - thank you for those lovely dishes and the wonderful background info on the food and great service."
Coriander Leaf,4.3,14,Asian Fusion,5,25-Feb-16,"Tried the degustation menu as a part of office outing..surprisingly great combination of options! The marinated prawns, crab croquettes, tamarind Venus clams and lamb chops were an absolute delicacy! The wine selection was just about average..but the service was top notch..give this a try!"
Coriander Leaf,4.3,14,Asian Fusion,5,14-Apr-18,"Welcome to Flavor Town! Asian tapas, gives you a great opportunity to share a variety of crazy good dishes. Great wine list and beverage menu as well!"
Coriander Leaf,4.3,14,Asian Fusion,1,17-Dec-17,Total rip off restaurant. I wondered why the place only had 3 reviews given that it's been open for a long time. Everything is tiny portion and over priced. We spent 400$ for a party of 3 but left hungry so went down the road for some chicken rice for $40 and it was way better. How does a rip off place like this stay open is beyond my imagination. Maybe all of us are tourists and they have no repeat customers.
Coriander Leaf,4.3,14,Asian Fusion,5,6-Jul-16,"Amazing place with such unique flavours and experiences. The staff are a credit to the place, highly enthusiastic and a pleasure to have around you while you eat. This place is a must visit for any trip to Singapore. You simply can't miss it and the cost is remarkable for the value. A very social occasion as well."
Coriander Leaf,4.3,14,Asian Fusion,5,29-Sep-18,Very nice food. Crab tasted good but a bit small... huangjiu chicken over expectation
House of Peranakan Petit,,,,4,6-May-22,Great experience of peranakan food!  A small private place. Feel as if you are at your getaway dining place.  It's very interesting taste but you must try their Ayam Buah Keluak and Assam Fish Head. It's gravy taste much better with rice. They are addicting!  As for Ngohiang and lady fingers are alright. Definitely will go back and had those Keluak and fish head.
House of Peranakan Petit,,,,5,17-Mar-23,"Food was the best! And service was great! First time in Singapore and this place was recommended by a local friend. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by warm smiles! Our waiter explained everything !"
House of Peranakan Petit,,,,4,10-Jul-16,"I read somewhere that the Peranakan, or Nyonya, cuisine is one of the earliest example of fusion food evolved in the 1950's when the Chinese traders decided to call Malaysia their home. Ingredients easily found in China were not so readily available while in this part of the world, so local ingredients had to be utilized. Cooking with local Malay ingredients in a Chinese style and voil¨¤, an early form of Asian Fusion cuisine was born.  Cozy little restaurant that seats 28-30 people I'm guessing. The interior decor was designed to give that authentic shophouse style feel with just enough decorations and colors to tell you that you're definitely not in a Chinese restaurant. It's not uber-chic like Violet Oon's Kitchen but neither are the prices. Unfortunately, there was a large (and loud) table of diners next to us and made our dinner a bit uncomfortable, but at no fault to the restaurant.  We had a very nice first experience trying the Peranakan cuisine. There was so much more I had wanted to try but with just 3 people dining, we just couldn't do it. The dish portions were not very large which made it great for sharing and offered a good way to try more dishes with smaller dining parties.  I don't know if it's just the style of cuisine but the dishes came out of the kitchen lukewarm or more like room temp. It didn't matter because the heat from the spices made up for it! We tried Ngoh Hiang, Beef Rendang, Babi Pongteh, Garam Assam Snapper, Chap Chye, (and some others I forgot). The Babi Pongteh was a little weird because there were small bits of bones and cartilage in the meat, so it was not a very nice feel in the mouth, although the sauce it came in was nice. So the food was very good and definitely unique in taste, but as a friend suggested when I said we were having Peranakan, everything starts tasting the same after a few dishes. So my suggestion is to try to order dishes that spreads out along the taste spectrum (i.e., spicy, tangy, sweeter, etc.).  A welcomed unique cuisine that offers so much more that what we experienced today. Will be back to try the other menu items."
House of Peranakan Petit,,,,5,3-Jan-16,"One of the most amazing meals I had in Singapore! Was taken here by local colleagues for lunch as I had heard and read quite a bit about the local Singapore cuisine that had sprung up when long ago the Chinese and Malay folks had intermarried and created a new local ethnicity (also called Nonya, i believe) and a way of cooking that melded the Malay curry cooking with traditional Chinese food elements.  I put myself in the hands of my colleagues and thanks to them, got to experience an amazing range of starters, mains and desserts! The Assam Prawns were so good - lots of tamarind mixed with palm sugar and just balanced right for that sweet-sour taste. The Ayam Buah Keluak was another delight in each bite - the black nut had this amazing filling that i just could have kept eating all day long. We also got a vegetarian mushroom dish (I can't remember what its was called, but again, just delicious) as well as this dish of Chinese noodles swimming in a wonderful seafood sauce with tons of calamari and baby octopus (yum! yum! yum!). I totally over-ate and wished had a 2nd stomach - only being the company of work colleagues stopped me from licking the plate, it really was that good.  Since there's always room for dessert, we got Ubi Kayu, which is a soft sago ball rolled into fresh coconut flakes - just so delicious, and prefect way to end meal.  End Verdict?? I would so totally go here again!"
House of Peranakan Petit,,,,4,22-Apr-19,I would said is it a very good Restaurant. The environment and the food is excellent. The service is very friendly. Strongly recommend to try.
House of Peranakan Petit,,,,4,25-May-15,"This was our first time to try Peranakan food and looked forward to trying out this intimate ""petit"" version of House of Peranakan.  I originally thought that ""Petit"" referred to the location and limited number of seats (only 30) , however after seeing the size of dishes wonder if instead it's a reference to the tiny portions.  Lucky for us ,we were a party of 7, so had a chance to order and share a bit of everything. The food ,although in limited proportions was quite tasty. Of particular to mention was beef rendang, fish head curry and long beans Sambal. The dishes were not overly spicy and paired well with a cold Asahi. Any location in Tiong Bahru is welcome and is a great location to wander afterwards while digesting."
House of Peranakan Petit,,,,4,17-Nov-16,"Wandered in here while exploring the Tiong Bahru neighborhood today and lucky we did. First was prolly suffering some heat exhaustion as today was the first non rainy completely sunny day during our visit to Singapore. I felt a bit lightheaded and my leg muscles were starting to feel painful. We had initially planned to eat at the hawker center but decided we needed AC. this place was small, quiet and super cool inside. We ordered the fish head curry, rice and chop chye. The curry was really really spicy but in a great way with mustard seed and chili and beans and eggplant. I think the spices revived me. The chop chye was decent and had some sweetness that countered the heat from the curry. In order to cool off afterwards I had the tapioca balls with coconut ice cream and palm sugar which reminded me of the yummy desserts I had in Bangkok. The hub ordered something with durian pur¨¦e on it for the experience. He said it tasted like a rotten sweet garlic. Anyhow the prices at this place were worth it - the curry was 23$ and more than enough for us to share. Anyhow after lunch I felt much more normal and ready to face the heat again outside."
House of Peranakan Petit,,,,5,2-Dec-17,"I really enjoyed eating at House of Peranakan on my trip to Singapore. They put in the right level of spice and heat to be authentic, without being too overbearing."
Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,20-Jun-22,"Date of visit: 6/20/2022  Came here after my mom's follow up procedure at Gleneagles Hospital today. We were all so hungry because there was a delay in my mom's discharge and all of us didn't get to eat ""lunch"" until around 5 pm ish or so T.T  I've heard good things about Song Fa Bak Kut Teh before but never had the chance to try it until today. And boy were my parents and I all so impressed!!  I ordered: - pork tenderloin claypot - pork tenderloin soup - bakkut teh (the one with rib bones) - prawn roll (ngohiang) - you tiao - cai sim - braised egg - braised beancurd sheet - crispy garlic fried chicken - Mee Shua All of them are so yummy delicious! There were only 3 of us (my parents and I) but we were managed to finish all the dishes! That's how good they are!  I tried 3 different Bak Kut Teh during my two-week stay in Singapore and Song Fa is definitely my and my parents' favorite. With Song Fa, we closed out our visit to Singapore on a high note!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,26-Mar-23,"We went to the Clarke Quay location on a weekday around 5 pm. We had to wait in line for about 15mins. We received a paper QSong Fa Bak Kut TehR code menu and placed an order while we waited in line. As soon as you sit down, we got the food almost right away. We ordered a large pork rib soup(unlimited broth refill), claypot pork tenderloin, cai xin (green vegetable), and 1 bowl of rice for 2 people. The pork rib was tender and the meat came off the bone easily with enough chewable texture which was perfect. The pork rib broth was deep in flavor with a clean taste. Not greasy or oily or have a bad smell from the pork at all. The claypot pork tenderloin was perfectly seasoned and tender as it was paired with rice. This was one of the best meals we had in Singapore. We can see why this place received a Michelin star."

I would either take it hot or with ice.  This is a must visit if you are in Singapore for a visit"

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",4,26-Jul-16,"The outlet was newly opened and located in quite hidden location at the level 2 of the shopping centre. Menu and wet tissue was served after I was showed to a table. One could reject the wet tissue as it is chargeable. The condiments such as sliced chilli, dark soya sauce, light soya sauce, chilli sauce can be found at the divider by the table. There was also a teapot and hot water from the tap on the divider to brew tea. There was a pail available for the bones.  Pork Ribs Soup ($7) Served in a traditional rooster bowl with 2 ribs and garlic. The pork ribs was quite tender. The soup was peppery. The soup was refillable. A staff would go around with a kettle to refill the soup. Throughout the meal, the staff refilled twice for me without being reminded.  Braised Chicken Feet with Beancurd Skin ($4) The chicken feet was very tender and melt in the mouth. The beancurd skin was not bad too.  Mee Sua ($2.50) Its texture was quite smooth and light.  Do take note of your table when making payment at the cashier. By the way there was a 7% GST and 1% service charge on the bill. Staffs were friendly and service was fast."

The meat was extremely tender and the soup was delicious (peppery taste). I also love how you get unlimited broth refill.  Located inside The Centrepoint and even though I went in when it was almost closing time, the service was still very good. The servers were very efficient and attentive.  10/10 would recommend everyone eating here!"

These are one of the few chains (others are Ya Kun Kaya Toast, Din Tai Fung etc..) that I wish were in the United States, however since they aren't, I certainly take advantage of visiting these restaurants overseas in Asia.  Song Fa Bak Kut Teh's key selling point is that they have this amazing broth that they constantly refill for you (unlimited), pair this with rice, enjoy some of their stir fried veggies, pork shoulder and Bak Kut Teh and you will have a very enjoyable meal!"

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,17-Nov-19,"Pork rib soup is an icon of my childhood --- eat it all the time. But Song Fa does it differently than my home recipe. My home recipe is often sweeter and often made with corn, but Song Fa's is peppery and delicious. The rib is definitely some really nice ribs and is full of flavor and fall off the bone even though it's pale and seems like it wouldn't be very flavorful. The soup is the kind that warms your belly, probably has some ginger or something in it to make you feel all warm and tingly inside. Probably great when you're sick, it'll keep you warm long after you leave the hotel AC and go out into the blistering heat....  One thing though! They do charge if you use the handwipes on the table. I brought my own hand sanitizer so I didn't use them. But it seems free because they just have it on the table when you sit down -- knowledge gained from here on Yelp and confirmed after I went to Song Fa!"

It is much roomier than the New Bridge while still offering same quality (you know, they don't suffer from the degraded quality that is common as restaurants expand)  Onto the food. They serve Bak Kut Teh (duh) in the style that I prefer. The soup is peppery and one could definitely taste that the broth came from hours of boiling pork bones. On top of that, they do have unlimited broth refills, so don't be sad if you're running out of the delicious soup, they would refill it for free. On top of that, there are other side dishes, which are common offerings in most BKT stall. The side dishes are all fine but I think the dough fritters deserves a special mention. Their dough fritters are crispy without being oily, which complements the soup very well.  Another thing that one may want to note, they serve 2 kinds of tea. One is the common teabags and the other one is the traditional chinese tea (complete with all the chinese tea set, you know the one with the small cups)."

Hopheads,4,4,"Bistros, Tapas/Small Plates",5,19-Nov-14,"Ok, first off I have to admit I may be a little biased since a friend of mine runs the place, but I promise you will thank me later for introducing this newly-opened bar n bistro.  The concept of the place is simple: premium craft beers at affordable prices. While they have a kitchen serving brunch and tapas (try the Truffle Chips!), the biggest drawing factor for me is definitely the all-day bar which serves American craft beers. In case your hipster friend hasn't already let you in on the latest booze to hit town, craft beer has been popping up in cool cafes like Assembly Ground and Morsels (you know, the kind that has wooden clipboard menus). But as far as I know, Hop Heads is the first bar that is dedicated to craft beers only (their headliner is ""Craft Beer Bar and Bistro"").  Craft beer is like the whiskey of booze. It's a lot more complex than your regular heineken or tiger beers, so it's like a whole new experience with every gulp. If you have a good palette, you'd probably be able to describe the craft beer like connoisseurs talk about wine (""a hint of clove"" ""an apple aftertaste"") but if you're just a regular jane like me it's just pretty cool that you can actually smell the flavours before (and after!) you taste it.  So naturally you'd think that such speciality beers would be pricier than usual, but here comes the kicker - the entire bar is priced lower than anything you'd find along clarke quay. With beers and ciders ranging from $8-$15, most of the patrons guzzle about 2-3 bottles or pints each. Yes! They have 2 beers on tap. Go To IPA seems to be the more popular one but my favourite is the Summer Solstice. It's seasonal though so I'm waiting to see what's going to replace it.  Besides the summer solstice on tap i would recommend the hazelnut brown nectar - it's really amazing!!!! And my lager-loving friends love the oatmeal lager (it sounds funky but apparently its so good they cant get enough).  So if you're in town around dhoby ghaut (or happen to be staying at Innotel Hotel) , this is an awesome place for a mid-day beer or after-dinner drinks. See u there!"
Hopheads,4,4,"Bistros, Tapas/Small Plates",2,15-Sep-19,"Ok firstly, it is stuffy af as it's located in the basement. Secondly, the staff were very rude and oblivious. Thirdly, the prices are overpriced for the quality of food. I just have to say that the cheese tasted so cheap and fake, kinda like those type of cheese mix with mayo (those hawker Center cheese fries is even way better). Fourthly, there was so little sauce that we ordered another side of sauce (salted egg yolk as seen). It came to use in watery sauce???? OMG. Disgusting. Fifth, we Can find cheaper pizza with better quality. Six, Staffs eager to clear plates when we are not done eating and interrupted us in our conversation. Super rude and disrespectful. Only good thing is that there's games here. Wouldn't come back."
Hopheads,4,4,"Bistros, Tapas/Small Plates",5,31-Jul-17,"My friends brought me and my boyfriend there and we love it! They have beer pong table and their asahi beer really good and affordable. There are games for people to play too, like Jenga and poker cards. Overall, I had a great time there playing and chilling with my friends!"
Kusina De Pinoy,4.3,3,Filipino,5,30-Aug-15,"I have to admit that this post is slightly biased because the owners were so hospitable, but hopefully with the combined reviews from others, you'd believe my words.  My first real foray into Filipino food and I'm hooked. Prices are reasonable and the food has been slightly tweaked to suit local tastes, such as use of pork slices instead of pig's ear. For the more conservative Chinese, there are many aspects of Filipino cuisine that bear similarities to Chinese cuisine. Mee dang Hoon for example was very much like fried beehoon and fried danghoon, and their fried roast pork was simply heavenly. It was the last dish and we were already full and bursting when it arrived, and yet we had to put it into our mouths.  I don't know how to spell most of the food we had since someone else ordered and I simply remembered it by sound, but they were mostly recommendations from the owner anyway. The spring rolls were also incredibly crispy, filled with mince meat and seeming like a more crispy version of Ngoh Hiang. Sisig is also another must-try, a hotplate meat dish with egg and lime. It's a pity we never got to try the desserts as we were simply stuffed, but the little fussy 8 year old has already loudly proclaimed that he wants to go back next Sunday so I might have another shot at ordering those desserts. Until then, we would have to coax our helper into attempting to recreate as closely as possible some of these amazing dishes."
Kusina De Pinoy,4.3,3,Filipino,4,9-Sep-12,"Lovely Filipino food! I had some new Filipino colleagues drag me here one weekend and boy did we have a good time! I had the chicken sisig which was truly delectable. The ambiance was loud and messy, but it was still very comfortable and homely. Being situated in the east you get a lot of east siders. I just love this restaurant and am a frequenter now. They might even be sick of my face! It is right next to my church so every Sunday they know to expect me. It is an open air, within the mall itself. The service was polite and well mannered. You could tell that they were well trained.  The food - excellent!"
Kusina De Pinoy,4.3,3,Filipino,4,23-Mar-15,"Located on the first floor of Roxy Square, Kusina de Pinoy is the best Filipino I've tried in Singapore. In my opinion, even better than Gerry's Grill in Orchard or any of the Philippine stalls in Lucky Plaza. Strong words, I know, but hear me out.  I judge the quality of a Filipino restaurant based on two dishes: Pork Sinigang and Chicken Adobo. Pork Sinigang is a tamarind based soup filled with pork. For locals, think of it as the Filipino version of Bak Kut Teh. As opposed to the peppery taste we all know and love, Sinigang is most known for its distinct sour taste. Kusina de Pinoy's Sinigang is particularly sour, which makes it downright Amazing! Yes, the more sour it is, the better (my personal opinion). I find the Sinigang served at other Philippine establishments lacks this sour umph. The reasons for this are two-fold: (i) there is too much water in the dish and is thus diluted or (ii) the chef has scrimped on the sinigang mix. To top it off, the sinigang had a healthy serving of tomatoes, bok choy, onion, and daikon radish. My only wish was that there was a healthier serving of pork and/ or the the use of pork spare ribs! If you love Bak Kut Teh, you should definitely try this dish.  The Adobo Rice was also good. It's a must try if you love garlic rice. Personally, I thought there was too much garlic rice. Crazy to say, when Filipinos, love rice!  Overall, I'm huge fan of Kusina de Pinoy. As a Filipino myself, I can attest to its quality and authenticity. This is my go to Filipino restaurant not only in Katong, but in all of Singapore."
Dragon Phoenix,4,5,Cantonese,5,25-Jun-13,"During our recent trip to Singapore, I realized that owning a Chinese restaurant in a city filled with a gazillion Chinese Restaurants must be tough. A restaurant has to be really good, as well as innovative. I do think that Dragon Phoenix fits that bill.  This hidden gem is on the 6th floor of the Novotel Hotel which sits right on Clarke Quay. The location is convenient and there is parking!  For Hawaii readers, this restaurant reminds me of Royal Garden in the Ala Moana Hotel. It is a dimly lit, elegant Chinese restaurant with table cloths and beautiful rosewood chairs and wall paneling. This is the kind of Chinese restaurant where the food is not slammed down or rushed. We ate here twice - once for dim sum and then several days later for dinner.  Dim Sum was a very delicious. We had the usual steamed char siu bao, xioo long bao, look fun, spare ribs, etc. All of it was hot and fresh. Hard to mention more than that as dim sum in Singapore is pretty much always delicious. However, we had a couple of different items that I've never seen before. First were these pumpkin looking dim sum. They were a mild pumpkin flavored flour wrap with a custard inside. They were really neat and different. The other interesting item was the Spring Rolls that were twice as long. The difference in presentation really made you want to try it. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dragon-phoenix-singapore?select=pV_sfTVKWhXzWoj-6_tUtQ#5oUj6iyFemDbJSlTEii9sQ  The best meal we had here though was dinner. We were treated to a magnificent dinner in one of the private rooms. Each dish that came out was amazing! The highlight of the dinner was the whole Suckling Roast Pig. The skin was so thin and crispy and was served with these pancakes. It was to die for! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dragon-phoenix-singapore?select=mbL6Rrm384tHMPtPISAYig#vUK-ga3Q8U0cOdxzbCUGRQ  Another notable dish was the Shark's Fin Soup. To be honest, we never thought we would ever eat this dish again now that it is illegal in Hawaii. I did feel a bit guilty though. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dragon-phoenix-singapore?select=mbL6Rrm384tHMPtPISAYig#mbL6Rrm384tHMPtPISAYig  The last dish that I loved and would go back to eat was the Taro Ring with vegetables. I've had the taro ""basket"" before which is like eating hard chips. This dish was mashed taro that was deep fried where the outside was deliciously crispy (not hard) with a melt in your mouth mashed taro inside. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/dragon-phoenix-singapore?select=mbL6Rrm384tHMPtPISAYig#IO7U6hzwv5XASyoOBXPqWQ  Service here was amazing. We had Maggie serve us both times and she is a delightful lady and totally on it. We always had clean plates, filled water and tea. She even portioned out most of the dishes. I loved how she urged us to eat the Taro Ring while it was hot. We enjoyed chatting with her about her world travels. Hopefully, the next time we're in Singapore we can go back to Dragon Phoenix for more delicious food and to see Maggie!"
Dragon Phoenix,4,5,Cantonese,5,28-Sep-14,"Traditional Cantonese dim sum in nice traditional chinese restaurant setting. No fancy fusion nonsense here just good old fashion dim sum done the good old fashion way. The steamed dishes were especially good, fresh and clean on the palate. No worries about overly salty or flavoured food here. My personal favourites are the steamed pork ribs and steamed bean curd skin rolls. Easily one of the best I ate in awhile. Important tip though: it is a hugely popular restaurant especially on weekends so either get here really early or make your reservations in advance. Personally I like coming when they just open in the morning to enjoy my dim sum and tea in peace and quiet."
Dragon Phoenix,4,5,Cantonese,5,1-Oct-14,"This review is for a fantastic dim-sum lunch a couple of months ago.  For now, there is a dim-sum lunch special. All dim-sum is at half price! 50% off!  Dragon Phoenix has been my family's favourite dim sum place for a while. According to their website, ""...Back in 1963, Master Chef Hooi Kok Wai, one of the Singapore's ""4 Heavenly Chefs"" opened an eating establishment that all would talk about....""  The restaurant is on the 6th floor of Liang Court, very traditional and typical. Service is good, most of the staff are experienced and mature, no nonsense.  For lunch, you would order on a menu-sheet at your table. Just mark on the paper what dim-sum you would like. At 50% off, try everything!!  There are also non-discounted items, and these will be listed on the main ala carte menu.  Dim Sum you must try:  Chee Cheong Fun - Char Siew, Shrimp Pan fried carrot cake Glutinous rice in lotus leaf Deep fried banana and shrimp roll Char Siew Pao Egg Custard Century Egg Porridge  Actually, just try everything! And order more of what you like.  Dim sum here is not pretentious. It is simple and good, and fresh. Dishes come fast and furious, but it is ok, you will eat just as fast as the bamboo steamers get plonked on your table.  We always have a pot of tea (Pu Er) with the dim-sum, piping hot and fragrant.  For service, this is exactly what you need from a chinese restaurant. Staff that know their stuff, refills the teapot promptly and brings your mustard for your dim sum.  For food, this restaurant delivers what it promised: Cantonese cuisine! And dim sum being quintessentially cantonese, who can deny?  For value, the dim sum special (half-price) is the best time to try everything and then some.  This restaurant has a space in my heart, as a reminder of good times with my family and some of the best dim sum I've enjoyed."
Dragon Phoenix,4,5,Cantonese,1,23-Jan-18,"This used to be one of the restaurants that we visit for dim sum lunches but after the recent visit, it shall be the last time. I was surprised that a restaurant that was once packed with families during Sunday lunch time now is dead town. There were only 8-10 dim sum items available and the reason for such dismal selection is the head chef is no longer working at this restaurant.  The service staff were busy bickering with each other instead of paying attention to the guests.  The peking duck and vegetable dishes are decent but the limited dim sum selection tasted mundane.  Will not be going back, seems like the regular customers have also chosen not to..."
Dragon Phoenix,4,5,Cantonese,4,25-Feb-15,"We enjoyed a LoHei banquet here and couldn't fault the food, service or upbeat atmosphere.  The venue is very traditional so is not for those seeking a modern environment but the menu is delicious and authentic with reasonable and pricey options.  There is little natural light or outside views so whatever the time you visit, it feels like night time."
Chuckwagon BBQ & Grill,,,,4,1-Aug-14,"We came here at 9pm on a Friday night and it wasn't too packed. The weather was nice so we sat outside.. The wings are delicious, freshly fried and they're quite the treat. We ordered level 1 and also one without any sauce and even without any sauce, the wings are still delicious!"
Chuckwagon BBQ & Grill,,,,5,8-Jan-13,"Nestled in a cozy and green corner of Singapore, this place has the best Buffalo Wings in town. There are 3 levels on the menu (The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly). Fo those chilli craze diners, The Ugly or level 3 is way to go. If you are more crazy than that, you can opt for higher levels which is off the menu. It's at your own risk though."
Chuckwagon BBQ & Grill,,,,4,18-Mar-14,"Chuck Wagon has got a great chill out place to have drinks and dinner. Love the ambiance. The buffalo wings are pretty awesome.... i usually go for level 2 cos it's got a great balance of spice and taste. If you go during their happy hours, a jug of beer cost $20 which is a pretty cool deal. Overall, i would recommend this to everyone."
83 Seafood Restaurant,5,1,Seafood,5,16-Apr-16,"You can't go to Singapore and not experience the food, al fresco style. The restaurant is nothing glamourous. Plastic chairs and tables outside the typical shop front that houses a few restaurants.  We were a party of 10 - and yes, I am related to all of them (apart from my cousins boyfriend but he'll be part of the family soon enough) and we fit nicely around the round table where we laughed and chatted. My aunty did the ordering and she did well. We were sold on the restaurant by ""crab beehoon"" - so that was the first thing we ordered. The crab was fresh and the sauce flavoursome. However, the gravy was mostly at the bottom so we had to mix it up ourselves.  My top two dishes were the chicken and the ngohiang. The chicken ... SOOOOO TENDER, crispy skin and topped with the crunchy crunchy onions I just can't get enough of. The ngohiang was flavourful of pork, crab and waterchestnuts added for crunch. Fried to perfection and served with a sweet dipping sauce.  We also had a steamed crab, because hey - a family of 10 can't just have one crab! Razor clams (err delicious), tofu (yum), baby spinach (yum) and venison (didn't try as I'm not a big fan in general).  We walked away absolutely stuffed. Definitely go here for local flavours and casual dining!"
Happy Tummy,4.8,4,"Desserts, Salad, Cafes",5,7-Apr-16,"Happy Tummy, Happy Yummy! This is my all-time favourite salad bar. I probably go there twice a week. Fresh ingredients, friendly peeps and so much cheaper than Salad Stop!  A Single, gets you a base of romaine and 5 toppings for $6.80. A Double (which supposedly feeds 2 peeps, but I eat it all by myself. Moo!) gets you a generous base of romaine and 8 toppings, all for $10. They also give unlimited herbs and condiments, like basil, oregeno, parsley, fried shallots, garlic and sesame seeds. I usually get the Roasted Sesame or Miso Sesame dressing. Premium items, like spinach, roast chicken or freshly grilled salmon (made in house), cost anything from $1 to $2.50 more each. Even then, my Doubles never cost more than $13. If I went to Salad Stop, I'd get half the amount for the same price. And for half the smiles too. (Alright, I'll stop knocking Salad Stop!) They also serve wraps, soups, ice-cream waffles, cold pressed juices, coffee/tea and baked goods like macaroons, muffins, tarts. But I'm usually there to eat ""clean"", so I just take in the smells.  There is a seating area for about 15-20, but it looks a little crammed, so I usually take out. Probably not good for big groups. If you're a student/staff from SMU, Kaplan, NAFA or Lasalle, you get one free additional topping, and if you are from RSM International, the Ascott Limited or Citadines, you get a special discount. They also have a loyalty card. 4 orders gets you a free topping, 8 gets you a free premium, and 13 gets you a free Single salad.  I LOVE HAPPY TUMMY!"
Happy Tummy,4.8,4,"Desserts, Salad, Cafes",5,9-Apr-16,"Tried this after reading Jackay's review! Went on a Friday night.  The selection for toppings is endless. from kimchi to century eggs and there are safe selections too. Interestingly, they serve waffles, soups and other desserts too.  I had a wrap+chicken+5 toppings and my partner had a single salad consisting of 5 toppings. It cost under $16 and was very fulfiling. This is easily one of the most value for money salad places in Singapore, besides cold storage. Others are incredibly overpriced!  The staff recommended me to take an extra meat but I declined so it can make me 'full' as I chose mainly light ingredients.  A constant stream of customers arrived, most likely Kaplan students.  Happy Tummy is new to market, and I saw on their Fb that they are opening a new outlet at Yishun! Lucky Yishunittes. .Definitely coming back to try!"
Happy Tummy,4.8,4,"Desserts, Salad, Cafes",4,3-Mar-17,"Not the highest quality ingredients, but a welcome breath of fresh air in a mall with very few cheap decent options.  I got stuck in Wilkie by the rain. It was lunchtime so I thought why not.  The position of the restaurant is quite nice, having the seating in a corner means a spacious view including on the street (seeing the sky in a mall! who'd have thought), although the tables are very close together and you will bump into people.  The burger patty definitely came from the freezer as did the sliced Kraft cheese on top. Salad was alright, although a few of the grapes were very soft. The sesame dressing was great, the chef has taste. The lemonade was enjoyable and did not have the cleaning fluid feel of the artificial stuff you find in food courts. I just want to point out this is not a hipster salad bar with specially imported ingredients, just Cold Storage/Fairprice stuff thrown together at an attractive price, not a destination, but a good place to hang out if you already live here. Definitely a good option for a traditional breakfast, and I guess I should try the salads people are raving about.  All in all, but a welcome addition to Wilkie for those of us who just want a simple healthy lunch without paying $20 at any of the mediocre ""food concepts"" nearby. Together with the arrival of Hao Wei Lai opposite, things are looking up in the not-hipster, not-hawker segment for the neighbourhood."
Happy Tummy,4.8,4,"Desserts, Salad, Cafes",5,18-Nov-15,Affordable salad with a wide selection. Ideal location right beneath my classroom making it a definite choice for me for lunch or dinner before and after class. Love coming for the wide array of food and the friendly staff
Ah Loy Thai,,,,4,26-Jun-23,Food is excellent; service is good; ambiance was ok. Come for the food. Come when they open or it gets full fast. We came on a Monday evening around 6 pm.
Ah Loy Thai,,,,5,21-Dec-23,"Enjoyed a Thai lunch with my friend near Bugis. We had a cold refreshing lemongrass drink. My friend proceeded to place the order for a fried fish, seafood tom yum soup, spicy sweet potato leaves, pandan chicken and rice. It was a wholesome meal at a good price. Enjoyed the fried fish and tom yum soup. It is self service where you order and pay up. It was a full house and we enjoyed our meal. Ambiance feels like an authentic Thai hole in the wall that is packed."
Ah Loy Thai,,,,5,5-Dec-18,"Reasonably priced delicious Thai food! Order your food and pay up at the cashier, grab your own water and utensils, and wait for the food to be served!  The butter calamari, like many others have said, is a must try. Their pineapple fried rice and tom yum soup was delicious, flavourful, and definitely packed the flavor punch. I also enjoyed their vege and pad thai.  10/10 would return again!"
Ah Loy Thai,,,,5,28-Aug-18,"Reasonably priced, bustling like Bangkok, good food - what's not to like?  This is the best Pad Thai I've had in Singapore so far - it was flavorful, not too wet, and had a nice kick when you mix the chilli powder into it. The other dishes are good too, I liked the omelette and Tom Yum Goong. The Tom Yum was delicious and warm and had the right balance of spicy and sour. The only dish that puzzled us was the Basil Chicken - it was good, but didn't look like what we expected. The pandan chicken was juicy and well seasoned, and the veggies were fresh!  The best thing about Ah Loy is the prices - everything is super reasonable, and it's right by Bugis MRT's Downtown Line exit. Can't wait to come back for more!"
Ah Loy Thai,,,,4,7-Dec-18,"Very crowded during dinner. Would recommend the pineapple fried rice, green curry, padthai, pandan chicken. Garlic pork is so so"
Ah Loy Thai,,,,5,14-Nov-19,"Very close to the stop find from the East-West line. We ordered phad thai, red basil leaf w/ ground pork, fried kang kung, fried potato leaf, mango chicken, and mango sticky rice, all of them delicious. The total, including drinks, was about 60 SGD--such a deal. I highly recommend this resto."
Ah Loy Thai,,,,5,19-Oct-17,"Being from the States, I love finding authentic Thai spots (or so I thought!) The food here was absolutely amazing and spiced to perfection. Before I head back tomorrow I will be picking up some Tom Kha soup to eat while I'm waiting in the airport. I wish I was staying in Singapore longer to enjoy this restaurant more!"
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,2,27-Apr-22,"Had an absolute terrible experience last week on my first visit there. I had heard of the legendary MTR in Bangalore and had nothing but a great experience in the original restaurant. However, this restaurant leaves much to be desired with their poor and apathetic service. A friend recommended I try out this place for a different South Indian food experience. 4 stars for the food- it tastes different than the typical Tamilian South Indian food. More jaggery in their Sambar makes it sweet and yummy. They have some unique menu items not found elsewhere- Akki roti (like a baked paratha), Ragi dosa, Set dosa, Rava Idli. All the food tasted good and felt fresh. However, service was extremely poor. The manager has a worst attitude with customers and staff which complicates this poor service to make it even worse. Ordered a set dosa, mini Idli for the child and normal Idli for another family member. It took 45 minutes and 5 reminders for them to even bring our food. On top of that, they missed (or as I think, deliberately left out) the mini Idli for my child. Manager had an arrogant attitude of ""only 45 mins , wait more"" arrogant attitude and no apology or sense of responsibility on missing an order deliberately after a 45 min wait. Despite the decent food, I will never ever enter here again. When you are located at Serangoon road with 100 Indian restaurants near you, it is critical to realize you are in the customer service business first of serving food. Avoid them like I will do"
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,8-Nov-19,This was a delight to go to in little India. Very good service and authentic unique menu which is not so common in South Indian restaurants. I have been using MTR spices and have known this brand since childhood. So going to the restaurant was exciting and special. The manager graciously let us keep our stroller outside the door and mentioned not to worry about it. The server was very helpful and told us to try few specials which we relished. I definitely enjoyed their set dosa. Highly recommend this place if you are looking for South Indian meal or just tidbits.
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,4,12-Jun-19,"Great food at good prices. I ordered the Mini meal, pudi idli and buttermilk.  Pudi idli ($5) was my favorite Bisibelabath, raita, rava kesari and avial (in mini meal, $6) were outstanding. Veg pulav was good and curd rice was decent. But again I've never been a fan of curd rice so my opinion could be biased. Buttermilk ($3) was very good too. The portion size is generous. One dish should suffice."
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,15-Nov-20,"Our favorite goto place in singapore for the most authentic south indian food. Food is so good, we always forget taking pictures before eating for this particular restaurant. Getting inside has a long waiting line (for good reasons). But its worth the wait. Prices are very reasonable for the food taste and quality."
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,29-Jan-20,"Love that I stumbled across this gem on my first day in Singapore! Delicious food, kind service, reasonable prices, credit cards accepted. I've been working my way through the menu and everything I've gotten so far has been fantastic. Always crowded, it's that good."
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,3-Oct-17,"Love, love, love MTR in Singapore! Don't miss the bisibele bath, set dosa and filter coffee. Liked it so much that we had MTR catering and all our guests loved it. Fully vegetarian menu. Service is fast and restaurant is centrally located in Little India."
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,3,8-Mar-18,Overhyped Indian snacks restaurant. Prata Walau serves better dosai at better price too! Good for tourists though.
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,25-Nov-17,Uddin vada- similar to a donut. Very good... Fried crispy but inside was soft Pudi masala dosa- has a spongy texture. Came with potatoes on top Mini meal set- tastings of five different rice "stew" sampler
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,1-Dec-17,"Some amazing South Indian food here! Its a very distinct style though, something I've not tasted so far! The dosa is thicker than usual but oh so crispy!! Loved the vegetable special dosa.. unique texture and great taste. The rice idli and coffee was amazing too.. will be back for sure!!"
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,3-Jul-16,Nothing more you can ask for a early morning Dosa. Crispy and spiced just nice. Came here at exactly 8:30am Saturday and was the first customer. No issue finding parking which is mostly a drag for eateries around here. Place is clean service is excellent. Before 9 it was packed.  Back again July 3rd with the in laws and yep this as good and efficient as ever.

MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,22-Nov-19,"On the first morning during a business trip to Singapore, my boss gave me two options for breakfast -- Continental breakfast at our hotel or some Indian food. Wasn't much of a choice. We walked for about 40 odd minutes from our hotel on Orchard to Little India soaking in the heat, humidity and the greenery. Admiring the clean streets and the well-mannered motorist. Silently pondering that this looks and feels like India except for much cleaner. Sigh!  We descended onto MTR courtesy Yelp. MTR is a small, clean, air-conditioned restaurant. Trust me 40 mins of a morning walk in 90% humidity you respect air conditioning. I ordered the pudi dosa, neer dosa, and the filter coffee. I confess I wouldn't have tried those (except filter coffee) if it were not for the nudge of my colleague. I had never tried those two. The pudi dosa came first with the chutney and the sambhar. Oh, man! Those flavors and the texture. It looked like an uttapam (the savory pancake) with ghee and a concoction of red spice on top. Not hot but spicy. Amazing flavors. It had been a while that Indian food has surprised my palate. Writing this review triggers the flavor and aroma memories, such a delight. Then came the neer dosa. Neer means water in the local language. As the name suggests its very light and subtle flavors. Quite the contrast from the previous dish. This came paired with coconut sauteed gently with cardamon and sugar. It was heavenly for me, my colleague, on the other hand, was slightly less impressed. He said he has had better neer dosa. I believe him it was amazing for me. Two chutneys and the sambhar came with one of the dosas, not sure what came with what. What I can tell you with confidence it that my colleague and I agreed that the coconut chutney was as authentic as it gets and as flavorful as one expects. We topped off the food with filter coffee. That was probably the least favorite for me. It tasted like instant coffee. Not a huge fan.  I went back another day for more pudi dosa. My new favorite south Indian restaurant only 17-hour flight away from Palo Alto and 5 hours from India :)  PS: I wish I had clicked pictures."
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,4,16-Jul-17,"I wasn't wanting for vegetarian but was very happy I sought out MTR is Little India. Authentic curries and breads stuffed with all good things, such as potato and onion. Popular with the locals too, so you know you are into a good thing. Do try it! If it's veggie curry in a hurry you're after, you won't be disappointed."
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,4,29-Oct-19,"Firstly, the place is clean, and I mean CLEAN, even by Singapore standards, in keeping with the high standards set by the original location in Bangalore. Try to go before 11:30am for lunch, especially on weekends, and before 7pm in the evenings. To order, one must get in line at the cashier and pay up front. Then one gets a stand with the order number which is displayed on ones table. Menu highlights include the ragi (finger millet) dosa, bisi bele bhaath (rice cooked with lentils and veggies), puliyogare (tamarind rice), maddur vada (crispy fritters seasoned with onion, curry leaves and spices), set dosa (like pancakes) served with coconut veggie curry called avial. Drinks are decent: the lassi is always good to try, as is the badam (almond) milk. This visit I had the akki roti (roti made from rice flour and seasoned with onion and green chili) and button idly soaked in thove (kind of a thin daal, without the typical spices of sambhar or rasam). For dessert, I highly recommend the badam halwa, which is a deceptively small serving. However, since it consists of just ground almonds, ghee and sugar, it packs a massive punch. DO NOT underestimate its ability to fill you up. Only reason I give it 4 stars is that the spice level is often a tad too high for me. Else thumbs up, including for the prompt and courteous service."
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,1-Jul-18,"Not only is the indian food absolutely incredible but they were extremely considerate about my dairy allergy here. The food came out quickly and the owner double checked to make sure it had no allergens. Great food, great vegan/dairy allergy options, and nice service! Plus lots of free drinking water. All around great experience"
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,7-Apr-14,"Recommended by a colleague. They're a famous chain in India and have set up shop in Singapore.  LOVE this place. The restaurant is a bit on the small side and they must be popular as there was a small queue when we arrived on an early Saturday afternoon around 2pm. They have a good system to minimize waiting by allowing you to place your order and pay while in the queue then being seated closer to when your food is ready as all orders take about 10 minutes.  My guess is b/c everything is made fresh to order. They specialize in South Indian cuisine and everything is vegetarian. The place is spotless, well lit, and air conditioned. A big pitcher of water with napkins are also available at all tables which is totally worth the extra few dollars you'll pay per dish than at say Banana Leaf.  Everything was delicious, especially the tomato rice dish (wish I remembered the name). The set meal I had was also good, comes with a couple of fluffy pooris, white rice, daal, etc and good value for money.  I think we've found a new favorite Indian spot in Singapore!"
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,26-Oct-17,this was the most authentic indian food ive tasted in singapore. the staff were extremely friendly and even seated me at 3 pm right as they were closing down for a switch to dinner. i was really blessed by my experience!! highly recommended!! a must try in singapore!!  many thanks!!!   *pictured below is a famous single uddina vada doughnut accompanied with chutney
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,17-Jul-19,Love the food. Not a veggie guy but this place has one of the best dosas in town. Enjoyed the unique experience
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,3,24-Nov-17,"This place was up off the beaten path past Little India and my husband and I went way out of our way to go here based on the reviews. We ordered dosai (dosa) dishes and the sooji (halwa) for dessert. The dosai were way too crispy, missing the al dente chew you look for in a good dosa, especially if you intend to roll it up; it requires a flexibility to do so. Service was meh and the wait was long for a table. Lots of local Indians so clearly they are doing something right though."
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,6-Dec-20,"The best dosas I have ever tasted anywhere. Having grown up in Karnataka (original home of MTR), I know the dosas. Rava idly is another must try! The staff are cordial and service so efficient."
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,21-Nov-17,"We went to MTR for breakfast two days in a row as we loved it! Food was freshly prepared and tasty. The restaurant was very clean and well kept. The staff was attentive. It does get pretty crowded on weekends. As soon as you enter the restaurant you need to place the order at the counter before being seated. Hence it's better to take a look at the menu, which is placed outside the restaurant before entering so that you don't feel rushed. I would highly recommend this place for good old Indian breakfast."
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,3,27-Jun-15,Most variety for a south indian vegetarian place in Singapore. Everything is made in ghee.. This adds to the taste but also to the waist. Everything is good but the place next door has a homely feel and super tasty dosas.
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,2-Feb-18,Deliciousness exemplified! The taste of set dosa took me back to the days of delicious dosas at udupi upahar in kormangala.... south Indian cuisine is hands down the best of all!!
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,16-Jan-18,"Best vegetarian food and so clean! Masala dosa is my favorite. Also had the chai. Was there with a large group, and we liked everything we ordered - clean plates around! Highly recommended. Good service, very fast, and delicious!"
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,4,21-Jul-13,"My favorite South Indian restaurant in Singapore so far. It's a chain from Bangalore, and the Singapore branch, opened earlier this year, is the first one outside India.  Their masala dosas are amazing, the crispiest and lightest I've had anywhere. I've also had a few new dishes I'd never had before, such as bisele bath, which is sort of like a tomatoey rice stew, made with rice, lentils, cashew nuts, carrots, and other goodness. My other favorite is kharabath, which is kind of like an Indian polenta, made from semolina with a bunch of spices.  The older gentleman who takes your order at the front counter is very helpful and friendly, and patiently explains and recommends different dishes. He also backs up the talk - today, he told my friend and me to try their freshly ground coffee instead of just ordering Cokes, and said if we weren't happy with it we should come and see him afterwards. Thankfully, there was no need for fisticuffs with the old dude, because the coffee was damn good."
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,2,4-Nov-18,Poor quality. Oily food. I guess this is the state of all Indian restaurants in Singapore.
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,1-Jun-14,"The dosas both masala & rawa were excellent, the best part is that the accompanying sambar for each dish be it the dosas or the vada or rawa idli was distinct! And each of them were pretty good particularly the accompaniment to rava dosa which was similar to avial, the good old sambar was pretty good as well.  The vada was excellent, the rawa idli & filter coffee were good.  Overall a very good addition to Singapore's Indian Food scene"
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,7-May-16,"Great place to enjoy Indian vegetarian food. Food is heat and the ordering And delivery is really fast and efficient. Across between sit down dining and quick service. Everything seems to be priced at $5. Very clean and new, as well."
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,25-Jan-19,"The best South Indian food in Singapore for the price range. That's saying a lot since there is a lot of completion for the same kind of food there. Used to go there often, love the dosas, button idlis, vada, filter coffee. Consistent good food, used to eat there then pack food for home. Highly recommend it."
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,25-Dec-18,Amazing restaurant. Very homely food for me as a South Indian. The food is well cooked and tastes very different and unique compared to other Indian restaurants around Little India. Try the Pudi Dosa (A dosa with spicy chutney powder and ghee) which is very special to this place. Service is fast and friendly. I will come back again and again and again.
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,3,9-May-15,"Excellent vegetarian restaurant with amazing bisi bela bhaat, good dosas, decent idlis. Ordering is a pain and almost negates all the good. The set up is plain silly - you will spend ages queueing in the cramped entryway. Everyone takes ages to decide. Huge menu. Several 'day of the week' items + daily specials complicate things further. Always sell out of some so you choose and choose again. And worse, typically gluten free South Indian dishes (such as idlis and dosas etc) have been modified to add ""rava"" which is semolina and thus wheat-based. Wish these guys would find someone who could help them fix the simple things that make a great restaurant concept with pretty good food a mediocre experience.  Suggestions if management is listening - Change ordering location and system. Add simple descriptions of dishes. List ingredients. Simplify the menu - put day of the week dishes and daily specials on a separate one or board. Let people enjoy the whole experience."
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,13-Feb-16,Awesome place. Fantastic food and great service. The quality of the food matches what one is used to back in Bangalore. Love going here and will surely go back there soon.
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,4,22-Mar-18,"A friend took me here for lunch today to introduce me to food from his home region. I am not familiar with the type of food or even vegetarian food much, but I thoroughly enjoyed the meal. The staff was friendly and kept asking if I liked their food. We tried four different dishes and I generally liked them all. I would definitely go back and eat here again. Great food and great history to the place."
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,5,18-Jan-16,One of the best places to have Indian Vegetarian cuisine. Spice combinations are delicious. Prices are very affordable. Might get a little busy during normal meal hours but definitely worth the wait. Rawa Masala Dosa and Onion Uthappam are highly recommended.
MTR 1924,4.4,35,Indian,3,16-Nov-15,"Good place for a South Indian breakfast. Need to order food and pay at the counter, before you sit down. I don't like such restaurants; otherwise I would have given it 4 stars."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,10-Jun-24,"First time here, ordered the half chicken  Taste 0.5/1* Chicken was chilled, tender and juicy on the spot, the sauce was similar to Tian Tian, savoury, sweet, if had fresh could be the better one, but as we brought it home, the chicken quickly dries out for some reason  Value 1/1* Cheaper than other store, aka good value  Service 1/1* Fast and friendly  Cleanliness 1/1* It's a hawker center  Overall/Revisit 0.5/1* Might revisit if not in mood for other one, but definitely no take out  Paying for ambience/reputation? 0/1* NO Above and beyond? 0/+1* NO"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,1-May-24,"This was my first meal upon landing in Singapore and it did not disappoint!  I ordered a large serving size of Hainanese Chicken Rice and got the set meal for a total of $8. This included broth, bok choy, and chili and oyster sauces. Everything was so delicious and I enjoyed the texture and flavors. The rice and chicken were cooked perfectly and were so tasty!  Friendly service, short wait, cash only. ATM conveniently located within Maxwell FC.  I definitely preferred Ah Tai to its competitors! (Especially the popular overhyped one just a few stalls down...) Poached chicken version only available here and they're closed on Tuesdays.  If you have time for only one chicken rice joint, Ah Tai is the one. Trust."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",2,19-Feb-24,"It's strictly ok to me  I understand... this is nostalgic for people in singapore. But for me, this was basic and didn't have much redeeming value.  Did a side by side of tian tian and ah tai hainanese chicken.  I'm going to copy and paste this same review for Tian tian and ah tai.  Tian tian: long wait (this is where the out the door line is). It moves fast but you also have to be pushy. The sauce had move flavor, and the chicken was more tender. Everything else was the same  Ah tai: shorter wait, nicer people. The broth they added on the side was delicious. The chicken itself had more ginger flavor and was still very tender and moist.  If I had my choice, I'd go be to ah tai because the broth is an added bonus, and the line is shorter."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,2-Jun-24,"I wanted to try Tian Tian for the famous Hainanese Chicken Rice, but it was a Monday so they were not open :( So my consolation prize was Ah Tai. Still worth trying both either way if you get the chance. It may appear basic, but it's a staple in Singapore."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,3-Nov-23,"Ask a local....or your Houston CM Jandito...for a recommendation.  When in Singapore, eat Hainanese Chicken Rice.  Visited the Maxwell Food Centre with our guide, Cheyenne, from Indie Singapore Tours. Had already bookmarked Ah Tai, but couldn't decide between that and Tian Tian. So interesting that the chef at Ah Tai used to be the chef at Tian Tian.  The food at Ah Tia was so delicious. For 6 Singapore dollars, you get a generous serving of chicken rice with a boiled chicken on top and a soup. Add some thick soy sauce. Delicious!  Note: the locals tend to go more to Ah Tai. The line was wrapped around the building with another tour group for Tian Tian."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,13-Dec-23,"I prefer Ah Tai over the more famous shop a few stalls down. There were no lines and the couple working the stall were very friendly. They gave me my place of chicken and chicken rice, soup, and a saucer of chili sauce. I looked down and the woman then hands me another saucer of chili sauce and says ""I better not see this in the trash, lah "". I mustered up my best Singlish and said ""of course not, lah!"" and we had a laughed.  If you want the better chicken rice in Maxwell, go here!"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,19-Sep-23,"Everyone in Singapore says get the chicken and Rice. Looking at this dish looks so boring just plain looking chicken and plain looking rice. There was a good size line in front of this stall and the one next to it had a longer line, the guy in front of us said the other stall is more famous but this one tastes better - good enough for me. Wow I was surprised how good this seemingly boring dish tasted, so good we got another order. Tasted perfect with some Tiger beer we got from the stall next to it. This is in Maxwell Hawker Market next to MRT station across from Buddhist Tooth Temple that you should also check out. Yes a must try for anyone visiting Singapore."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,15-Nov-22,"We were debating between this place or the famous chicken rice place 2 stalls down and since this place has a shorter line, we went to this one instead :)  Short history, the owner of this place use to be the head chef at the famous place for 20 years! He decided to open his own shop as a competitor hahaha  The chicken and rice is really good. The rice is smooth and very fluffy and aromatic. The children is tender and juicy.  Definitely worth a try"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,20-Feb-23,"I tried Ah Tai because tian tian is closed on Mondays and have no regrets! This is the perfect Hainanese chicken rice experience. The chicken is so moist and the sauce is a wonder sauce, I can dip anything in it. I got the combo for $6 Singaporean dollars with bok choy and soup which I highly recommend as the soup was life affirming and tasty. While chicken rice seems like an unassuming dish, I understand why Singaporeans are obsessed with it, everything you need in tasty, melt in your mouth morsels, hearty and so so affordable! Definitely worth a stop on any Singapore itinerary."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,4-Mar-24,"I found their chicken rice is more tasty than the most popular place (just few stall next to them). There are few foodie blogger said the same thing this place is better. I just can't taste too much different between the chicken, but the rice and sauce definitely are more tasty. It is hard to explain and you just need to try it yourself. The service is fast and the ladies (casher) was very friendly. Make sure you bring cash at hawker center. Overall the experience is good. I tried both stall in the same time, and order small size to max out your stomach to taste all the good food at the center."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,20-Jul-23,So "the locals go here while the tourists go to Tian Tian" the saying goes... both are outstanding and I did prefer Ah Tai for the sauce. SOOOO good! Also beautiful that the line was super short
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,2-Sep-22,I prefer Ah Tai over Tian Tian (3 stalls over). You can definitely taste the ginger in the chicken which I heard helps tenderizes the meat. The rice has just enough of chicken flavor and fat. The chicken here MELTS in your mouth; it's SUPER UBER tender. This is my favorite chicken stall in all of Singapore. They also give a side of chicken broth and it comes with extra soy dipping sauce and a side of the spicy bright orange chili/garlic/ginger sauce.
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,2-Dec-22,The chicken rice was super good! I'm not a fan of bok choy but I ate every last bite.
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,23-Apr-19,Best hainan chicken rice I've tried so far! Tian Tian is more popular but the rice is not as good as Ah tai. Both are good but ah tai wins easily! The sauce is also better. Rice is flavorful and had a great texture.
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,20-Sep-18,"Back for our yearly trip and since we were close to Maxwell food court, I decided to head in to grab some Hainan chicken and rice. Once we entered, I quickly saw a long ass line that had formed for Tian Tian. Since it was a hot and muggy day (typical Sing weather) I quickly remembered a good friend mentioning that Ah Tai was as good if not better than Tian Tian. Glanced over and saw that there were only 2 people in line, I made a b line over. Pricing wise, both are similarly priced (IIRC) but Ah Tai didn't have a long ass queue. Within 5 minutes, I was inside an air conditioned taxi and headed back to the hotel room to eat.  At first glance, both places offer a cheap and tasty lunch/dinner. The main difference between the two was how fragrant the rice is at Ah Tai. I don't remember Tian Tian being as fragrant and actually thought the rice texture at Tian Tian was slightly off the last time I ate there. The chicken at both places were good, tender and moist but Ah Tai does throw in some veggies which is a nice addition to the regular dish.  Will have to do a head to head comparison next year but for now, Ah Tai reigns king in my book for chicken and rice."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,28-Sep-19,"Based on some YouTube videos and the yelp rating we decided to give it a try. This place is kinda hard to find with google navigation.  Ah Tai can be found right in the center of hawker center. This place was opened by someone who used to work at the famous tian tian hainan chicken  Flavor 3.5/5 The chicken is very standard. What's special is the rice which was very flavorful.  Wait and line 5/5 The wait is pretty decent. We waited 3 minutes at 12pm on Saturday. The wait at tian tian was 35 minutes  Price 5/5 $5 for a set (chicken, rice, soup and veggie) is unbeatable and you get the best value of the price for sure  Comparison to tian tian: Tian tian's rice tastes even better and is more flavorful as they have adjusted the recipe multiple times since opening. However the price is slightly more expensive with $9 if you want the veggies and chicken. The portions are slightly less there and you wait faaar longer. Overall tian tian is not worth the wait and is recommend ah tai if you crave or want to experience hainan chicken"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,20-Dec-18,"That's some good chicken!  Tian Tian was closed when I visited, but I read that Ah Tai Hainanese chicken rice was up there. It did not disappoint. The chicken was flavorful and moist. The best part was the aroma of the rice that they serve with the chicken. They have probably served millions of Hainanese chicken rice. They have reached perfection."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,31-Oct-21,4 years later and still my fave Hainanese chicken spot! Made sure to make this my first lunch stop when I arrived because I just couldn't wait. Tian Tian still has all the hype but that meant no lines for Ah Tai. The chicken rice was just as I had remembered it and still love the side broth. Can't wait to come here all the time!
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,25-Dec-17,"Ah Tai definitely gives Tian Tian a run for its money - the word just hasn't gotten out yet. Was at Maxwell a couple of times and each time, there was a long queue for Tian Tian whereas you were able to order and get your food in no time at Ah Tai. I've tried both and I can say that the chicken was just as moist and tender here. What's more, you get a bowl of chicken broth with your meal, which was divine, even if it was unbearably hot and humid out. But without a wait, you'll be in and out in no time."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,1-Apr-18,"Unfortunately, Tian Tian Chicken & Rice stall was still closed when I visited Maxwell Food Centre the second time that I was there. I read online that Ah Tai was still a good option for chicken and rice. I got here by 5pm before the dinner rush and the line wasn't super long yet. The line was long by the time I finished eating, but the lines seemed to move quickly from my observation.  The chicken and rice was good and cheap (i.e. 3.5 SGD for medium size). The chicken was moist and delicious. Not bad overall."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,4-Jun-19,"Best Hainan chicken I've ever had in my life.  If you're from Los Angeles, you're probably familiar with Savoy's hainan chicken, which locals always rave about. I honestly have never liked that place; but if you like Savoy, you're definitely going to love Ah Tai.  The funny thing is Ah Tai is on the 2018 Michelin Bib Gourmand but the guide has it listed as ""Ah Gong"" (which means the same thing as ""ah tai""). Weird that Michelin would make that error but I spent hours trying to find ""Ah Gong"" in Singapore to no avail, only to accidentally realize that it's three stalls away from Tian Tian Hainan Chicken.  For some reason, Tian Tian is more popular and has a way longer line, but I can tell you it's all hype. I tried both and I'd rather eat Savoy than the atrocity Tian Tian is serving. Ah Tai was so good, we got a second plate and devoured it in minutes. The chicken, the rice, everything was perfectly cooked and flavored.  You're missing out if you come to Singapore and don't give this place a shot!"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,7-Feb-20,"Ah Tai split off from Tian Tian (3 stalls down). The star here is also the chicken rice plate. Similar to Tian Tian, it's 3.50 for a small. Theirs comes with chicken broth on the side.  It's traditional chicken fat rice with breast meat (with bone and skin) and cucumbers. Their chicken was more tender and more flavorful, and the rice was richer. I think the portion was bigger, too.  I definitely preferred Ah Tai over Tian Tian.  Also, extra points for having plastic utensils during the coronavirus outbreak (the other place still had regular utensils - yes, more environmentally friendly, but I would like to limit disease transmission....)  Pro tip: grab a cold beer from the stall next door to go with your food!"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,19-Jul-20,"If you ever find yourself in Chinatown, head straight to Maxwell to this stall for the best chicken rice you will ever eat in your life. Mouthwatering slices of boneless white meat chicken over a bed of fragrant rice with fresh cucumbers and a light yet flavorful sauce await you. The chef used to cook for Tian Tian just a few stalls away - we tried both and ruled that Ah Tai was the clear victor. The house made chili sauce is a great addition to those who like a little extra kick!"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,6-Apr-18,"First try at Hainanese chicken! Went on a Thursday afternoon (around 5:30 pm).  Tried to go to the famous Tian Tian chicken spot, but they ran out of chicken (maybe a blessing in disguise?). Saw that quite the line was forming at this place so decided to give it a try. So glad I did!  Ordered the chicken set which came with soup, chicken, bok choy, rice, and 2 sauces. All that came out to 5 SGD. The rice was fragrant with garlic and ginger. I could eat the rice alone. The chicken was super tender and paired so well with the chili sauce. The chili sauce packed a punch and had a nice spicy kick to it. Honestly didn't bother to try the soy sauce looking sauce since I liked the chili sauce so much.  Liked this place so much, think I'm going to try to for another visit to this place before I leave Singapore in the next few days!"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,19-Mar-17,"Chicken rice, Singapore's national dish. You have not been, if you have not tried it. Dare I reject the opinions of the ""Travel Channel"" gurus and side with the locals? Look, this place is better.  Outstanding chicken. Tender and juicy, boiled in an incredible broth of chicken stock, its collagen, lemongrass, and other herbs. Served with a side of rice cooked in the same stock and a bowl of the magical elixir itself. Add a sweet molasses sauce and homemade zesty, herbaceous, fresh siracha and all is right in Singapore.  Incredible complexity and just plain delish.  A bargain at $3.50 SGD per set.  Half and whole chicken on offer. Lines get long (30 min plus). Don't worry, it won't be long before what is arguably the best chicken rice per locals is entering your drooling mouth!  Maxwells Hawker center, two stalls to the left of ""the tourist spot"".  Note: be willing to share your table with strangers. Outstanding."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,12-Jun-18,"A friend of mine visited Singapore before me and told me that if I did anything on my trip, it had to be visiting at least one Hawker Centre. We were recommended the Maxwell Centre and headed this way to see what we could grub on before our buffet dinner; we're little fatties, we know. Like many before us, we were hoping to check out Tian Tian. Don't judge us for being basic, Anthony Bourdain was a gd international treasure!! Unfortunately for us, it was closed on the Monday we visited.  Luckily, we spotted Ah Tai just a few stalls down. Our Hainanese Chicken cravings needed to be met, so we handed over a cook $5 SGD and were presented with a lovely plate of rice with a good serving of chicken and bok choy, a side of broth, and a few dipping sauces. The broth was nice and light, flavorful but not salty. It was just a bit too toasty in the Centre for me to really enjoy hot broth. The bok choy was great, and paired really nicely with the flavors of the tender chicken and aromatic and soft rice. And of course, the dipping sauces were an excellent addition to the meal (but I'm just a sucker for dipping sauces).  My sister and I shared this plate, and it was just enough for a nice snack for the both of us. It was so tasty we considered getting another, but figured we should try some other things while we were there. For $5 though, Ah Tai is probably the tastiest, most slammin' deal you'll find in all of Singapore."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,21-Aug-19,"I liked Ah Tai's more than the famous Tian Tian Chicken Rice. My friend waited 10 minutes to get his food, I waited 10 seconds. We both tasted it side by side to see which one we liked more and we both agreed it was Ah Tai's. This place is slightly cheaper and a lot tastier. We felt like Tian Tian was good but lacked the flavor that Ah Tai's had. Ah Tai even has an extra soup which was also a fantastic compliment to the meal. I would come back here!"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,15-Jan-17,"Came by for their Hainan Chicken the other day and it was a tasty experience! Located 3 stalls down from Tian Tian, this stall had no line.  Word on the street is that the chef used to work at Tian Tian!  The drumstick chicken rice was quite tasty. Chicken was very smooth and had a nice gravy-like sauce over it.  The rice was fragrant, soft, and flavorful.  My entree also came with a small soup which was a great way to finish off a light lunch.  Maxwell Center isn't air conditioned but they do have fans... Humidity and temperature might be a issue for foreigners!  ...Maybe get a cold drink before ordering the meal?  $4.2 SGD for a drumstick rice with soup."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,23-Nov-19,"If you're at Maxwell Food Centre, and having a hard time deciding between all the Hainanese Chicken Rice stalls - let me do the honors of narrowing it down for you. You should be standing between Ah Tai's and Tian Tian's. Both stalls are literally two spaces apart from each other.  Ah Tai used to work for Tian Tian as a cook for 20 years until he was let go by management, and started his own stall. Both are pretty good, but Ah Tai gives you more rice and a cup of soup! Plus there are no lines at all. I'd say give Tian Tian a try, but when you're craving chicken rice and can't be bothered to stand in a line - go to Ah Tai's. You will not be disappointed!"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,6-Aug-18,"Been meaning to write this review for a while. Revisited Ah Tai in my recent Singapore trip. I can confirm that Ah Tai still has it going on. Don't be enthralled by the long line at Tian Tian (mostly because of the Bourdain effect - also RIP ;___;). The chicken rice at Ah Tai is better and minus a wait. Chicken is so tender and the rice is just right. They also have a combo set you can order for $5.50 SGD with some veggies and soup. Either way, you can't go wrong."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,14-Aug-19,"With the unfortunate close proximity to the famous Tian Tian Chicken rice, this place never gets the respect. I believe the chicken itself at both places are comparable to each other (amazing). However I would give the edge to Ah Tai for the following reason: - no ridiculous line: Waited only 5 minutes during the busy lunch rush. - Side dishes: received a free chicken soup and the optional veggie. - Price to food ratio: about 5% more.  Overall, if you have one meal at the Maxwell Food court, Tian Tian is the popular/notable one to go to, however Ah Tai is the good locals spot to hit up."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,10-Jun-19,"tl;dr perfect for an expat ready to dive into the famed chicken rice dish! Super affordable and hits the spot, definitely *at least* on par with its more famous neighbor Tian Tian. This was all 5 SGD (~ $3.70 USD)!  I came to Ah Tai on my first night in Singapore (a Friday night), eager to dive into the hawker culture. In all honesty, I was planning on going to Tian Tian, but they had closed 10 minutes before I arrived (which was around 6:30pm? Oh well). I was not disappointed in the slightest, and absolutely loved my food.  The chicken was packed with flavor, and it was clear that the chef(s) at Ah Tai were professionals from the first bite. As others have mentioned, the rice had a great fragrance/aroma to it, which made the entire dish even more flavorful! The broth was flavorful yet not too salty, which is a pet peeve of mine in these sorts of dishes. While I also personally enjoyed the chili sauce, it can definitely be too spicy for some patrons, so be aware of that.  Overall, a wonderful place to be, and I will definitely return in the future!"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,18-Nov-18,"I don't know chicken rice, but I feel like I got a full education of it here.  Rice cooked in chicken stock, with some chicken and veggies on the side. There was also a bowl of soup which I wish I could get more of.  The chicken and rice were delicious and the sambal was excellent. Another sub $4 meal that I wish I ordered more of"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,24-Jan-16,"If you have read the other reviews, you would know the history of this stall. So I will not bore you with it.  This is my go to Hainanese chicken rice stall (don't mistake this with other types of chicken rice).  Rice is fragrant and the texture is just right.  Chicken is tender and flavourful, not too fatty.  Liver is good too but if you go too late, they run out of it.  They are also willing to give you generous helpings of Chilli, ginger and black sauce as well as chicken soup.  Service is good, no attitude problem.  No long queue for one of the best Hainanese chicken rice in Singapore."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,8-Jun-18,Food: 4.0/5.0 Service: 3.5/5.0 Value: 3.0/5.0 Decor: 3.5/5.0 Overall: 4.0/5.0  I've done T*** T*** before and anyone who knows me knows I don't do lines (unless it's A**le). Ah Tai did the trick. Basically just as good (you know I'm right) but basically no line. Don't be a lemming; save yourself the fifteen minutes and get this.
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,1-May-15,"$5 chicken rice set. That is all you need to know, lol!  Located in the Maxwell food court in the middle aisle, it's a few shops next to the famed Tian Tian shop reviewed by Anthony Bourdain as the best Hainanese chicken rice. I wish I was able to compare, but we came on a Monday and the shop was closed (much to our dismay)! We were only in Singapore for two days with Monday being the last full day, so we came to Ah Tai since it was voted by locals as the best Hainanese chicken rice. Plus, the dish is one of ten you must eat in Singapore, so duh...we couldn't leave without trying!  All you need to know is their chicken rice set comes complete and for only $5!! Comes with seasoned rice, a plate of bok choy, chicken, soup and three different types of sauces to complement your chicken. I especially loved the ginger, but the chili sauce is just as enjoyable.  Since it's a food court, seat anywhere as you please. The shop is super tiny and it's run by three dudes. One guy chopping the chicken, one guy plating the sides and the other handling business. They were very friendly, welcoming, and happy at 11am even though most of the stalls were still setting up. Glad I got to try this!"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,22-Jul-14,"Sorry Anthony Bourdain but this hawker stall's chicken rice might be slightly better than your favorite's icon fare. Since your T.V. Show the toe stalls have been battling it out for chicken rice domination. It is struggle that is virtually impossible to choose between gastronomic perfect, but I think fave to give a slight nod to these guys, for I actually found myself not caring about the added sauces and spices. Yeah, it is that good that the chicken and the rice are enough to pull it off without any extras. Truly, a very succulent dish which is well worth the line wait.  ***An additional note: apparently the original chief at Tian Chicken Rice, made famous by Anthony Bourdain's TV show, is no longer there but here...that explains a lot. Locals who are in the know line up for this chicken rice."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,28-Nov-19,"It's awesome. Seems like many of these other reviews tell the story and accurately too. Shorter lines, better food. (Not by much though!) Hainanese Chicken Rice is delicious pretty much anywhere. We actually bought a do it yourself package from a grocery store in Singapore and made it ourselves once we got home. Even that was yummy. Nevertheless Ah Tai is arguably the best of the best. You won't go wrong."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,22-Jan-14,"Since I tried Tian Tian last time when I was in town, which I enjoyed, this time I decided to give Ah Tai Chicken Rice a try.  I was not disappointed! Chicken was tender and juicy. But the star though was definitely the fragrant rice! I can just eat the rice the whole day... my sister can have all the chicken!  So how is it compare to Tian Tian? I guess next time I need to do a blind folded side by side comparison.  Or this is just my excuse to just have more Chicken Rice!"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,12-Jan-15,"Located just a few stalls down from Tian Tian chicken rice is their biggest competitor created from a spat between the original owner. The queue for Tian Tian on a sunday afternoon at 12pm had easily 50 people in line, Ah Tai on the other hand, only had maybe 5-10 people.  Sadly though the lady in front of me ordered 18 boxes of chicken rice which resulted in a bottleneck.  Watching them prepare 18 boxes of chicken rice let me see first hand how much work went into preparing the chicken rice. As you can see the background, the man with the cap was fishing out several whole chicken bones from the soup! It's no wonder the soup was so tasty and yet not peppery! I didn't feel too thirsty after drinking half a bowl of soup.  I was very happy with my plate of chicken rice. The rice was flavourful and the chicken was very moist and tender, so much better than the Yishun 925 chicken rice I just had a few days ago. I happily gulped down the entire plate and I will definitely be back with more friends and family to devour a whole chicken next time!"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,20-Jun-16,"Upon my arrival in Singapore, I had chicken rice on the mind. Given that I arrived just after midnight, my search would have to wait a few hours. After a few hours of sleep, I was on my way to Maxwell Centre to find this dish. I knew enough to avoid the lunch rush hours so I made my way over there just after 1 pm.  I saw the line for Tian Tian first but from my research I knew to look left for Ah Tai's stall. And there it was. I look another look at Tian Tian, Bourdain's picture and quotes plastered on the side and their menu and asked myself if I should really give this a try. Hipsters foodies couldn't be wrong, could they? Ultimately, the research I had performed looking through local/Singapore reviews won out and I found myself drifting over to Ah Tai to try the food from the person that originally made Tian Tian's chicken what it is today.  There was one person in front of me, so the wait was minimal. I ordered the steamed chicken rice, which came with rice, pieces of chicken breast, cucumbers and a bowl of the chicken broth. This is real food with the focus solely on the quality of the ingredients and the skill it takes to prepare it to ensure that its freshness is well represented. The food was served on a warped cafeteria tray, with all my dishes and utensils sliding quickly to the four corners as soon as it was handed to me. I kept telling myself to walk slowly and NOT DROP MY CHICKEN RICE!  The chicken was very juicy and very tender. The rice was moist but but not wet and full of flavor. The broth was clear and tasted of chicken, as it should. I did not find the food to be greasy, oily or fatty. The sauces provided enhanced the neutral chicken meat but still allowed the taste of chicken to shine through. No shortcuts were taken here. This is chicken done right, and all for $3. Ridiculous.  Even though I was sitting in front of a fan, this food centre can get quite warm. Remember to bring your own napkins. I also purchased a sugar cane and lemon drink from one of the many beverage stalls nearby."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,18-Apr-18,"This is a slight 2nd place to Tian Tians. A former chef at Tian Tian opened this location just a few stalls away from his former boss. The food is great! I would compare both just to see which one you like better. The rice is fragrant, and you can taste the granules between each grain. The chicken is soft, topped off with a light soya sauce and the dipping sauce is great. There are no complaints, but the slight (magical) edge goes to Tian Tian"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,7-Nov-15,"The Good: Arguably the best Chicken Rice in Singapore  The Bad: Since it's in a hawker center, the ambiance isn't the best and communication (in english) may be a challenge  The Pro-tip: Have your chicken rice with all 3 sauces!  I tried to go to Tien Tien, the original place that Anthony Bourdain ate at but it was closed when i went. Good thing i checked-out Yelp for other Chicken Rice places nearby. Ah Tai had great reviews and it did not disappoint!  Had abit of trouble communicating with the shop since their english wasn't the best. Good thing there was a good samaritan who translated for us! The chicken was excellent and the rice was perfect! Perfectly cooked, very flavorful and the sauces - soy, ginger and chili - were perfect complements to the dish!

Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,24-Apr-15,"Located in the same Maxwell Food Court that houses the icon and the biggest competitor, Tian Tian Hainanese Chicken Rice. They are just a couple stalls down Tian Tian Chicken Rice. I must say the Chicken in silky smooth, very juicy, moist and tender. I like rice here better than Tian Tian. Its very fluffy, seasoned very well, and slightly flavored with the chicken broth. The soup is also very tasty. The veggies is perfect cooked, and still crunchy. I slight edge to Ah Tai."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,5-Sep-15,"I actually wanted to eat at Tian Tian, which is just two stalls over, but it was closed! Luckily, Ah Tai was open and the line was long - a good sign. I ordered the chicken rice set for $5 and it was so much food! It came with rice, chicken, veggies, and a soup (plus the 3 dipping sauces for the chicken). The old man puts everything on the tray. The chicken was delicious. The rice was delicious. The veggies were delicious. And the soup was delicious. Get the idea? The red chili dipping sauce was my favorite out of the three. The yellow one (ginger or garlic based maybe?) was also good. Really yummy place for hainanese chicken rice!"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",3,27-Jan-16,"I had to try Ah Tai because it was literally two food stands away from Tian Tian, plus the owner used to be a chef at Tian Tian. It tasted good. They also give you some bok choy with your chicken rice so the veggie component is much appreciated. However, the chicken was small and choppy. It did not feel like good cuts of breast meat."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",3,16-Aug-19,"The owner of this stall used to work st the famous Tian Tian a few counters away. Today, the queue at Tian Tian lasts anywhere between 10 minutes (at opening at 10am, or mid afternoon) and 45 minutes (meal times); its prices are the highest among all the Hainanese chicken rice stalls at Maxwell (although that's still most reasonable); they only give out the chilli and dark soy sauces upon request (although that is very much part of the dish!). There is never a queue at Ah Tai. So, is it worth it? If you're not a foodie, the answer is ""hell, no!""'On the other hand, if you can tell subtle differences in the texture of the chicken, the fragrance of the rice, or the degree of kick in the chilli sauce, or if you just line up servings from the various chicken rice stalls at Maxwell (Tian Tian, Ah Tai, Heng Heng), you would have to say ""Tian Tian is the best lah!"" Unfortunately, Ah Tai would come third, although on its own, it is not bad."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,16-Jan-16,"Ah Tai and Tian Tian chicken rice are pretty similar in many ways. I heard that the founder of Ah Tai chicken rice had some links to Tian Tian chicken rice for a start, maybe not related by blood but in terms of skills in preparing the chicken rice.  The rice is flavorful, chilli, spicy hut not overpowering. For the chicken meat, tenderness is just right, not too soft, not too tough. Do not forget the ginger sauce as well, this adds a kick to the taste when you eat it.  Price wise seems a little cheaper than Tian Tian but they open 7 days a week so that is a big plus! This is especially so when you need nice food on Mondays, where a lot of stalls tend not to be open.  One thing to note is that you should specify if you want the cheaper smaller option, else they will charge the larger portion by default."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,6-Mar-19,"Only idiots (aka tourist or someone who just came back from a very long time travel will go to Tian Tian).  The chef behind Tian Tian success, Ah Tai not only had emulated the juicy yet dry, aromatic yet not overwhelming, bloodless yet not over poached, firm yet tender, uniformed, fresh yet not chicken smelly....  Ah Tai has bring this Hainanese Chicken Rice a few notch higher.  Don't trust any locals who tell you their fav chicken rice stall near here or there is better cos they know nothing.  Ah Tai's poached chicken is well massage before steaming. Only special bred chicken from a secret farm is used.  No other chicken rice stall in Singapore use this expensive stock."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,28-Dec-15,"What a tasty, satisfying hawker-style meal! We ordered half a chicken, oyster sauce veggies and 2 servings of rice - it was plenty of food to feed three and very well priced.  We got to the Maxwell Food Centre for dinner around 6:30 and after waiting in line to order we sat down at a table near the Ah Tai stall. Not long after we started eating we noticed people being turned away because they had run out of chicken - So probably a good idea to get in for an early meal if you want to check this place out!"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,1-Jul-16,"Came to the maxwell market to visit Tian Tian based on popular reviews, but it was closed at the time. Ah Thai was open with a long line. Come to find out that the chef actually used to work for Tian Tian and started his own business here. Of course, we ordered the chicken and rice set. Super valuable and great food. Definitely great fix and will be back. If you're in Singapore, you have to give this place a try at least once in your lifetime!"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,28-Oct-16,"Ate at this stall for the very first time last month. People have been comparing Tian Tian to this much more humble stall, and I was glad I finally gave it a shot.  In terms of taste profile, it was very similar to Tian Tian's. The chicken was moist and the rice was flavoursome. On par with Tian Tian, for sure."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,27-Apr-18,Another Hainan chicken rice to try. I waited about 20 minutes since there was a decent line when I got there. It was worth the wait.
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,4-Oct-13,"After eating at Tian Tian, I was rather impressed with their rice. However the chicken there is tough and ordinary. Eating at Ah Tai blew my mind away. The chicken is soft and juicy, almost could swallow it immediately without choking one bit! The flavor is there and the sauce enters the chicken very nicely. I never looked back and always go to this stall at Maxwell because the chicken and rice combination, price and service combination is a overall better value; far more superior. Needn't say more."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",3,4-Mar-15,"Honestly, the chicken rice here didn't taste that much better or different from Tian Tian... I gave it an extra star because the line is considerably shorter and the portion is bigger. Again, the chicken is bland and flavorless. If you ever had chicken rice in Bangkok, you will probably know what I mean..."

Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",2,5-Jan-13,I heard all about the chicken rice spat and I came to the Maxwell Food Centre (in late Dec 2012) to try Ah Tai's chicken rice to find out for myself what the commotion was about... but I only heard crickets. Ah Tai's stall was closed!  Why? Ah Tai scored a D in the hygiene department. The National Environment Agency (NEA) suspended his licence and fined him $800. The period of suspension is two weeks from 19/12/2012 to 01/01/2013. There was a sign pasted on the stall explaining the closure.  Read about it here: http://app2.nea.gov.sg/advisory_detail.aspx?news_sid=20121217655339917212  Looks like I gotta come back another day with a stomach of steel. The queue at the Tian Tian Chicken Rice stall was 30 mins long and wrapped around to the other side.
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,30-Jul-13,"Best chicken and rice in Singapore. My friend introduced me to ah tai and explained the history between them and tian tian. Having sampled both, I would agree with other reviewer that the overall product is a superior version than tian tian. The chicken is not bony or too fatty, has great texture, richness and very succulent. Also happens to be less busy and more friendly."

We had the benefit of locals to guide us, and saved the time in line/queue waiting to have Tian Tian's chicken rice. This was the chef of that stall, when it won the acclaim of several celebrity chefs.  I am sure the other is just as good...but why wait in line, if you don't have to?  You can easily purchase Beer right across from Ah Tai, I recommend Tiger, a local beer, that is very good."
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,19-Aug-12,"Most of us would have read in the papers about the mini chicken rice war at Maxwell, and for me, I really couldn't care less.  But curiousity got the better of me and I decided to head down to check out the Ah Tai's chicken rice. While the presentation is very standard (expected of hawker stalls), the meat is tender and the light soy dressing is refreshing.  For me, the clincher was the rice, whichi was glistening from chicken fat and full on flavours. It doesn't help that even though there are a total of 4 stalls selling chicken rice, the queues at Ah Tai are always long so be sure to get there early to avoid disappointment (he closes when everything is sold out)."

Having tried both Tian Tian and this stall, I have to say, this is slightly better. My humble opinion. Plus point is I didn't have to queue! The chicken was similar to Tian Tian but the Chilli was better."

Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,28-Jul-18,"Tried both Tian Tian and Ah Tai, plus several other hawkers while visiting SG. Personal preference is Ah Tai. The chicken is served on top of the rice, which is warm and moist. Chicken breast is extremely moist and tender with just the right amount of skin. Recommend trying both, but skip the line and try Ah Tai!"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",5,18-Sep-12,"Ex-Chef from Tian Tian brings us Ah Tai just a couple stalls down from the famous Tian Tian stall in Maxwell Food Centre.  As a fan of Tian Tian, I knew I must try Ah Tai, and I was happy to find that overall this place was actually BETTER.  The Chicken: Very very juicy, and also good portions like Tian Tian.  The Rice: Probably one of the best I've had in Singapore. This rice was better than Tian Tian. It was more fragrant and flavorful and the perfect texture.  The Chili: Awesome. Definitely hit the spot and complimented the flavors of the chicken and the rice.  I have one more thing to add here...  The Service: Awesome. Way better than Tian Tian. The woman at Tian Tian is a rude lady, she treats you as if she doesn't even want your business. The service at Ah Tai truly makes you feel welcome. He smiles, he invites you over, he presents himself as a happy man, happy to be doing business.  Overall, the entire experience of Ah Tai is just better than Tian Tian. There is no reason for me to go to Tian Tian anymore.  Ah Tai for the win!  OH!!! It is also CHEAPER than Tian Tian. :)"
Ah Tai Hainanese Chicken Rice,4.5,68,"Chicken Shop, Hainan",4,10-Dec-14,"my friend and i came here last night to try the chicken rice. the original plan was to go to both ah tai and tian tian and get a plate of chicken rice from each place. the chicken rice war between the two has been well-documented, so we were eager to decide who was the winner. unfortunately, tian tian was closed already (it was only 7 pm!), so we couldn't do a comparison.  we got a chicken rice meal for SGD 4.50, which came w/ a bowl of soup and a side of veg. the plate of chicken itself was quite small (much smaller than what i remember from tian tian, although it may be b/c it was a meal special). it was tasty, and the rice was good. the chicken was also quite lean yet juicy. i think i still need to do an assessment by comparing them head-to-head."

Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",4,13-Nov-23,"Maybe my review is not 100% reliable: I came here at 4 am, after a fun night of clubbing so my judgement might or might not be tainted by the alcohol I consumed beforehand.  But this is exactly what this place is, it is open 24/7 and provides the soothing comfort of a great local dish at a great price. Note that this is your typical Singaporean joint so service is non-existing but they rely on their dishes and their reputation.  I had dry bak chor mee with mee pok, extra vinegar and a Luo Han Guo drink. It was just what the doctor ordered: big flavors, great portion! The mee pok noodles were perfectly cooked and once I added some of the home made chili - it was just DEVINE!  Will it taste as good when 100% sober? Who knows but I am definitely coming back, sober or drunk because I loved the bak chor mee! Recommended!!"
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",4,23-Feb-20,We were looking for breakfast at 5:30 am in the morning and stumbled upon this place. This restaurant is located in a corner of the street and the best part is that it's open 24 hours a day. Also they have inside seating with AC.  We ordered the laska and it was only 3.50. It was okay. It did have a strong coconut flavor but it was lacking savoryness. We also ordered a dry noodle thick thin noodles it was 4.50. The noodles grabbed the sauce well. I also really enjoy the flavors. The last item we ordered was the satay been hon it was 5 dollars. Don't be the appearance deceive you. The sauce is everything and the clams they put in the dish elavates the flavors. Definitely a great combination.
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",4,18-May-16,"A couple of years ago, if you asked what my last meal was, I would've said bak chor mee. Times have changed and so have my tastes (trying to go gluten-free), but I do like to indulge in the dish every now and then. Yesterday, was one such day and Da Lian was totally worth it!  Noodles were QQ (al dente and springy), the chilli is really nice and the bowl had a lot of ingredients for $4.50. $5.50 gets you big-ass prawns and for higher prices you can get abalone, mother of pearl (NOT) or some combination of. If you're looking for the more vinegar-y type of bak chor mee or one with lots of pork lard, Da Lian isn't for you.  Seating-wise, you can go al fresco (which I did and thoroughly enjoyed). There's also a pretty big space inside which has air-con. What really did it for me though, is that the second floor seems to be one of the offices of the Workers Party! Da Lian forever!"
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",4,30-Sep-16,"I really liked this place! Their flavors are a bit more subtle but their open 24/7 so I'm a happy diner. It was clean, the service was prompt and the noodles were delicious. Best of all, there was no wait when we went.  The ladies in the front don't really speak English but they speak mandarin. There are pictures near the cashier so you can just point to the picture of the dish you want. We go the bak chor mee, fish ball soup, and a side of fish cake. I liked the noodle texture and the noodle flavoring. As I said before, the flavors were a little more mild but I liked that about their noodles. My boyfriend loved the fish cake there. The fish ball soup was also very tasty.  Overall, I would definitely definitely come back. Open 24/7 was also a huge plus! The food is good and the staff is nice!  Bonus tip, we walked to the national library of Singapore from here and it wasn't too far. They have a cool gallery in the library and it's totally worth checking out! There are also museums and on the weekend, a cat museum near by. It was by far, my favorite day of exploring in Singapore."
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",4,21-Nov-15,"I was trying to hit up Sungei Road Laksa but they were closed that day, so I m just jiving for some noodles and getting hungry. I was randomly walking by this place and saw it was pretty legit looking, and it had what I was craving for so I stopped and grabbed a seat. Glad I did because my instinct were spot on, this place had some good stuff.  I had the traditional dry noodles, with soup on the side, and a fishball soup as well. The noodles were al dente, with good textures, and flavors. The soups were well thought out, not as an afterthought; the meatballs, and fish cake had enough flavor and texture to hold its own.  To the SUPER noodle-junkie this might not be ""the spot"" but this place is pretty good"
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",3,23-Feb-18,"Kids: too spicy! Tastes good but it burns. We liked the vegetable balls.  Adults: the laksa is incredible - spicy, rich coconut broth with fresh ginger and a lot of seafood. Great value for about $3. Bring your own napkins. Don't look too closely at kitchen for cleanliness and food safety (hence the 3 stars)."
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",5,10-Jul-12,"Wah lau. These noodles are pretty damn amazing. Bowls start at just $2, and that's a tasty bowl of noodles. Do yourself a favour, and have some chili in your noodles. Oh, the dark, chunky, spicy goodness... Without sounding too chi-chi, it really brings up the flavour to a different level. I've only ever eaten the dry noodles, and almost always in the morning. It's almost like a early morning treat, except it compels you to go back. p.s. you can take touristy photos of an opposition political party headquarters while you're there too!"
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",4,8-Mar-15,"Noodle here are tasty, just cooked enough. So far one of the best fish Noodle that I had in Singapore. For 4 S$ you have a more than decent plate of noodle.."
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",4,29-May-17,The fish ball noodle is good and the spice taste makes it more flavor and delicious. Must try at midnight because you can see those people who just enjoyed their night life and want to get some food for bringing back to the reality. That is another way to know people lives in Singapore.
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",3,26-Feb-15,"It is not the best bak-chor-mee out there, but it is decent.  Service is quick and brisk, but despite asking for vinegar in my noodles, the standard serving still would not have enough of it. Maybe it is the teochew tongue in me that craves more (think Tai Hwa Bak-Chor-Mee at Crawford Lane). So I always end up asking for vinegar at the table and they will bring around a bottle for you to add yourself.  Big plus - they are opened 24 hours, in case you have a sudden BCM craving in the middle of the night."
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",4,9-Sep-12,"This stall dish out pretty delicious noodles and it can get as cheap as $2 if you are early (before 10.30am) but the catch is you have to dine in no takeaway. Otherwise, the minimum is $3.  Many years ago, I saw a customer order dry noodle with dark soya sauce and decided to try and now it has been my personal favorite at this stall. To make the noodles more mouthwatering and delicious, add a dash of their fried chilli into it.  At this eating house, other than the noodles, you can get fish porridge and nasi padang. I haven't tried the fish porridge but love the nasi padang here too. I think the name of the nasi padang stall is call sofia."
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",3,28-Aug-16,Fantastic $3.50 steaming hot laksa and moderate portion which was perfect for lunch. Clean and quick service. Plenty of seating both inside and outdoors. Bring your own napkins. Order and pay at the counter and they give you a number. Choose a seat and they will bring over the food. We got here via taxi.

Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",4,15-Aug-13,"I am not a mee pok expert. I wish I was as this seems to be one of Singapore's quintessential everyman hawker dishes (unlike the sexier chicken rice & chilli crab) but I'll be honest when I say that I find it difficult to distinguish quality between a good mee pok and a great one.  I live nearby and decided to try this place out late one night when I was feeling peckish. It had been much hyped online and, having lived in the area for a year, it seemed imperative that I try it.  The noodles did not disappoint. Very springy, great chilli and solid pork mince. Is this one of the best mee pok in Singapore? Hard for me to say but at $2-5 a bowl you will not leave feeling dissatisfied."
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",4,10-Sep-12,"Chasing the cheapest bowl of mee pok has led me here! After watching a Channel 8 variety show on noodles, I headed down after an ungodly run to send my schooling sisters to school in the far west. You get a bowl for only $2, not too big for the early morning grump and just right for what you can manage at 730am.  I've had it as dinner too, and the fishballs, minced pork is just right. Really enjoy the clear soup as well, really old school and nostalgic goodness here!  Parking is not much of an issue, you could try parking on the streets and keep a look out, but you didn't hear this from me!"
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",5,16-Oct-14,"I haven't found better mee pok in Singapore.  The noodles here are springy and properly cooked al dente, the vinegar adds the right touch of contrasting acidity, and the sauce is provided with a judicious sprinkling of crisped lard. True artisanal mee pok is a dying art in Singapore, this restaurant still carries the flame (or at least, a candle :-)"
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",3,9-Oct-16,"If you think that this mee pok is awesome then you need to try out more mee pok places. However, the place has a wide variety of food from bbq chicken wings to satay to laksa But None of those has something to shout about, the only good thing is they open 24/7 and that's about it."
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",4,25-Nov-14,"Their chilli is uniquely fried and tasty without being too spicy. Used to come with$2 morning special, just nice for breakfast."
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",3,26-Sep-12,"like the springy noodles and fresh ingredients. the chilli is pretty spicy, and it's the fried-dry-chilli style."
Da Lian Traditional Noodles,3.9,20,"Noodles, Teochew",4,4-Oct-12,"Not too much to say, other than that these are the best fishball noodles I've had so far in Singapore. I can't really describe what makes them better than other fishball noodles I've tried. It's not the fishballs themselves, since those probably all come from the same factory somewhere that I don't really want to know about. The noodles just seem fresher, and the sauce is just right. I guess that's about it."
John's Pizzeria and Bakery,5,1,Pizza,5,31-Jul-19,"As a California native, i was really happy to had been recommended John's pizza since Singapore pizza spots rarely fall under the American pizza category (plenty of Italian wine bar types around). The pizza is made to order and comes in 2 main forms: New York (thin) style, and deep dish. Since deep dish seemed like their signature, my boyfriend and I split the Jonh's 4 way.  The edges were crispy from all the cheese fried in the pan, and the dough was thick but fluffy, retaining a good chewy texture. Only wish was there there were more of the sauce and toppings! Just because the crust was so thick, it felt like it could use a little more sauce on top."
The Black Sheep Cafe,4.4,8,"French, Bistros, Cafes",5,10-Feb-24,"This French restaurant is an interesting contrast with the surrounding shops right smack in the middle of Little India. The duck confit is one of the best I have ever eaten. The skin is crispy and the meat is tender. The mango salsa is refreshing. Overall the combo is flavorful and satisfying. The attentive waitress highly recommended the pandan souffle which takes some time to prepare. The upper crust looks massive but once you dig in, the fluffy texture is light and goes well with the coconut ice cream. Definitely a great option when you crave French food!"
The Black Sheep Cafe,4.4,8,"French, Bistros, Cafes",5,23-Jan-24,We stayed in Little India SG and enjoyed some really great food in the Tekka Centre area. One of meals we enjoyed was at the Little Black Sheep Cafe for lunch. A truly different flavor for the area and one we would return again as a break from the local hawker center. Casual. Friendly. Delicious.
The Black Sheep Cafe,4.4,8,"French, Bistros, Cafes",4,15-Feb-20,"We made a reservation here for valentine's day and realised that the menu choice was restricted to a special V-day one. Nonetheless, we chose duck confit and beef fillet and ribs for our mains. Pan fried foie gras and baked oyster for our appetisers. I want to highlight the crispy duck and the soft beef ribs which were absolutely delicious. The pan fried foie gras was also a delight! I would return for another visit to taste their regular menu!"
The Black Sheep Cafe,4.4,8,"French, Bistros, Cafes",5,27-Aug-15,"What a little hidden gem! Good classic French good (and curiously, also Briyani!) and the fifth star is for its affordability. Really decent prices.  The duck confit was delicious and really well done. Good flavour, moist meat, crispy skin.  Actually there was no bad note to the entire meal - from the bread rolls all the way to dessert (excellent creme br?l¨¦e). Give this place a try!  Hardly anyone there at lunch time and easy parking in basement carpark."
The Black Sheep Cafe,4.4,8,"French, Bistros, Cafes",4,11-Mar-17,"So I don't really want to share this little secret...but I just can't keep this one to myself. Quality French cuisine at affordable prices! A three course prix fixe meal here will cost just S$48 nett (service charge and GST included). You can choose from one of 7 appetizers, 8 entrees, and 6 desserts with top up for certain appetizers or desserts. I also enjoyed the complementary warm bread, but the butter came out firm out of the refrigerator. There's a top up for the Baked Brie Cheese and the Pan Seared Foie Gras appetizers, but they're worth it. You can also order a la carte if you don't want all three courses.  All the protein dishes were very well cooked, but I was less impressed with the vegetable sides. I felt like the vegetables were just an afterthought and not much effort was put into them, even though they're an important complement to the meat. That being said, I enjoyed everything form the crispy pork cheeks to the duck confit to the beef tenderloin.  None of the desserts were very extraordinary though. Skip the extra charge for the souffle dessert as it wasn't really that great. The highlights are really the foie gras and the meats, but that's what most crave for anyway.  Service was mediocre...the waiter tried to be delicate, but he was just clumsy at times. We also had to call them over a few times to ask for things. For a fancier place, the service should be more on point."
The Black Sheep Cafe,4.4,8,"French, Bistros, Cafes",4,10-Jan-14,"I was there with my wife and toddler girl. We made a reservation via hungrygowhere for a party of 2 at 8pm but wasn't able to make it there until close to 9 due to work commitments. I was surprised to see only 5 tables filled on a Friday evening but it could be because of the late hour coupled with the location.  For apetitizer, we had the baked brie with pistachio. For mains, the duck confit and the cod tempura. We ordered the kahlua souffle for desserts and I had a Palm Amber beer. All for sharing, of course, in typical Singapore dining style.  The baked brie was really excellent and is a must try. The various flavours on the plate complimented each other very well and we had fun mixing and matching the brie with the sauces and sides. This is a must order for any newcomers to the restaurant.  The duck confit and cod tempura were very well executed. The flavours were typically light but sufficient and they generally work very well with each other within the plate.  The duck confit was flavoured just right for me when I usually find the dish a bit on the saltier side. It also came with a wonderful execution on mash potatoes which, I suspect, used oil fried in shallot as a base. Very flavourful and you cannot help but finish very last bit.  The cod tempura came in a very generous 2 huge pieces portion. The cod is very lightly battered with tempura flour and then pan fried to achieve a very thin and crispy outer layer. The cod remains juicy inside. It was a joy to have the flavours bursting through as you bit down past the crispy layer into the flesh of fish. Very yummy.  The kahlua souffle came well formed and the wait staff mixed in the freshly squashed passion fruit at the table after it was served. Tasted delicious but as we were both pretty much full after the main courses, we didn't managed to finished it completely.  The total bill came to just a tad under $100 at $97.50. Black Sheep Cafe does not levy service charge and GST."

The Black Sheep Cafe,4.4,8,"French, Bistros, Cafes",4,1-Jun-15,The duck no doubt is one of their best. The lamb was juicy and also highly recommended. The chocolate moose/souffle was a bit too creamy for our liking. Pricing is mid range... Ambiance was cosy. Service a bit slow.... don't go if you are in a rush. Advance booking advisable.
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,2-Jan-24,"Fantastic ambiance especially the outdoor tables to the rear of the opulent Marina Bay Sands. Most definitely, it is ideal for a night out on the city to enjoy a meal while viewing the 8pm or 9pm water/light show on the waterfront.  Enjoyed fried chicken and waffles with spicy watermelon and a fresh mango salad in addition to amazing drinks. Huge portions that are enough for 2-3 people to share.  Service was ""slow"" but still plentiful when we needed assistance.  Highly recommend for an evening out to enjoy delicious food and good company while getting a feel for the sophistication of Singapore life.  Definitely a place to return to!!!"
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,5-Oct-23,We brought our 18 month old daughter here with us for lunch. The service was impeccable and lots of attention given to our daughter!! We sat in their covered outdoor patio. Ordered the French fries with ranch and their wedge salad. Food was very good! Seems most restaurants in Singapore don't serve ranch dressing so it was a pleasant surprise to see them have a homemade buttermilk ranch dressing. Felt like home!!
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,20-Dec-22,Stopped in for lunch with my husband and 9 month old baby. They were very accommodating with my baby. Service was wonderful! Everyone was very friendly and attentive. Glass of rose was delicious. Great American burger was to die for. A double patty burger with a combination of meats served with fries. Husband ordered the wings. Very good but very spicy.
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,18-Dec-22,"I love this chain so much. Excited we were able to try this Singapore location. The staff was so friendly and helpful. The cocktails were fabulous. The food was also just as delicious as any other location we have been to. Highly recommend the biscuit & gravy, fried green tomato biscuits, and the power salad."
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,8-Jul-23,This must be my 4th yardbird. I swear I am not collecting them. I didn't do the usual chx and waffles but service was excellent (maybe because my friend was drinking cocktails like a marathon runner). Tasty libations and good atmosphere.

Chicken 'N"" Watermelon ""N"" Waffles ($45++) honey hot sauce, chilled spiced watermelon vermont sharp cheddar cheese waffle, bourbon maple syrup It smelt very delicious when served. But the taste was pretty average and the meat of the drumstick was rather dark. Frozen chicken with injures? The watermelon had a minty taste. The waffle looked kind of dry, although the cheese taste was nice. I kind of wish for a huge piece of butter on the waffle."
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",4,24-May-23,"Very good food with a great view. Prices are a bit steep, but otherwise an enjoyable meal."
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",3,30-Dec-19,"I've dined at Yardbird twice - this Christmas and 3 Christmases ago. Nothing changed. The restaurant is still beautiful, the service is warm and friendly and the food items remain unchanged. and that's pretty sad.  We were here for brunch last Saturday before a matinee show at the theater, so we kept things simple and didn't order too much - chicken & biscuit (a southern-style fried chicken sandwiched by a biscuit the size of a standard burger bun with melted cheese topped with a fried egg), a salmon avocado sandwich with a side of mac & cheese. Two black coffees to make it a complete meal.  One thing about Southern food is that it can get very rich to the extent of cloying if you have it too much, so I would suggest you come in a party of 3 or 4 and share the food. You'll be surprised to hear we can't even finish the food we ordered, as I was struggling to finish the mac & cheese towards the end of the meal.  Overall, the food was just decent. Not great. If you ask me if I would return, I will think twice or unless I run out of food options in MBS. A 3-star worthy of an experience only, unfortunately."
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,22-Jan-23,"Soul food that originated in LA. Although I never tried it when we were researching for food, they were hyping this up in Singapore so we had to see it for ourselves. The staff was great (thank you! We only had less than an hour to eat but everyone was so helpful), the place is so cute rustic, the food was really good. We ordered their signature chicken and waffles with watermelon that was more than enough for two (I never thought I'd love watermelon with my waffles. I think it was grilled). The chicken did not have any steroids and what's special about it is that they make their own maple syrup. Now I really have to try and compare when I go to LA and see which one is better."
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",4,2-Sep-19,"I was walking by outside Marina Bay Sands mall when I heard the sweet sounds of James Brown. When I looked at the menus, Earth Wind & Fire cane on. Needless to say, this was a good place for me. To make it even better, it was happy hour.  I likely wouldn't have stayed here given the prices but happy hour is a solid deal. Almost half off wine prices!  I had a killer burger that was way better than expected and much too large to finish! The fries were perfect and everything was a welcome sight after a full week in Singapore.  If you are ever hot and tired from seeing the sites but don't want to be in a dark whole somewhere, come to Yard Bird! Def a great meal and happy hour!"
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,17-Dec-22,Incredible food and service. Lobster is well cooked with nice and slightly crispy Mac and Cheese
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,13-Dec-17,"While looking through Yelp for some local options in Singapore that also had a craft beer component, I came across this gem in the mall across from yhe Marina Bay Sands. Now this is no regular mall... there was no Sears or JC Penny as anchor stores, this was a bit more upscale. I went here for lunch with a coworker and it was comfort food at its best wrapped in a great atmosphere. It was a little bit of the South transplanted in Singapore.  The decor was cool and hip with whiskey bottle lampshades and pictures of blues, rock, and jazz players along with elvis that flashed on the wall.  There was a great selection of craft beers and from the looks of it the cocktails were crafted with care.  I had the wings with fried okra and it was delicious. I just had to add the a side of mac and cheese. It was all so good, I had to thank the chef on my way out!"
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",4,6-Mar-23,Great burger great presentation. I really enjoyed the avocado toast! Burger might need a little more cooking if you don't like it medium rare...
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",3,19-May-19,"I dearly love a down home honest to goodness lovingly laid table, so when a joint in Singapore advertises itself as being a ""Southern table and bar"", my head was flooded with images of steaming collards, greasy hush puppies, flaky catfish, unctuous grits, juicy morsels for buttermilk fried bird, and of course unapologetically boozy cocktails. So maybe I was a victim of my own expectations from past Southern table experiences, but I felt a little sad after dinner this evening. I was left with the same sense of mild betrayal when something advertised as Penang char kway teow in Nashville, isn't. I'm just saying that expectations are a powerful thing and should be expertly managed just like every other element of the dining experience, oversell it, and you risk disappointing.  For me, the bird was nicely done but still came out having the mouthfeel and flavor of a frozen bird. Fried chicken isn't supposed to be good for you, it's just supposed to be good. Too often a compromise meant to walk the line between good for you and good with the end result being neither. I might be the one eater in Singapore who's actually advocating for a lard-fried bird, but again my bias for slow-frying in a cast iron skillet is likely clouding my judgement, just like a honestly made drink from a ""southern bar"". So I guess I'm fixin' to just say my peace on the matter and be done with it: firstly, the bird needs looking at, often it's the ingredient and not the technique, and secondly, the bar needs tweaking if it's going to churn out cocktails from a Southern bar. The old fashioned I had was so watered down and devoid of flavor as to have been indifferently churned out at a generic airport bar.  This concept has a ton of potential and solid branding to back it up, so there is no reason why it couldn't be bigger and better by being entirely different and actually being a roots dining experience rather than selling the illusion of one."
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",4,28-Oct-18,"While on business, I was told about this place so I decided to check it out. Dining alone, I chose a table outside and ordered a sweet tea, chicken & waffles and for dessert the peach cobbler.  Chicken was excellent. Super moist and huge portions. I didn't know how to feel about the side of watermelon, felt very antebellum to me but it worked with the overall meal. The sweet tea was not real southern sweet tea. I lived in Atlanta, GA... to know sweet tea.  The dessert was ok, presentation was beautiful but the peach to crust to ice cream ratio was off. Not enough of it!  What took this over the top for me was the location of the restaurant! It was right in front of the MBS light show! I'd go back to get something else and to look at the light show.  Overall a solid 4.5 stars!"
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,26-Jul-18,"Wow. Just wow. I didn't know I had to go to Singapore for amazing southern cooking! And I am from Texas. Stopped here on our way to the theatre inside the mall, it wasn't very packed so we decided to try it. Service was amazing! The only place i was able to find southern ""sweet tea"". The menu was very unique and it worried me to try some of it but it was ALL delicious. It's a must if you want to get out of norm in Asia."
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,7-Jul-18,"GF and I came while visiting from San Francisco. This place is delicious! Tasty fried chicken plate and the omelette was great.  Paolo the bartender, is the man! Dude makes a hell of a cocktail and was so kind to share some local favorites. He wrote down a list a places for us to try. Made your boy feel right at home. For sure coming back here just to have a drink and hang. I ordered an off menu margarita and it was delicious  Definitely try the pork belly hash waffle. Yes, that's what I said..pork belly waffle. Great view of the bay if you walk outside."
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,12-Apr-22,"Food is nice, would come back again. I had the biscuit this was normal, however the fried chicken is really nice. Atmosphere is good too! Recommended!"
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,4-Jul-19,"I was in MBS for a meeting and was recommended by a friend to try this place. I had the fried chicken while my friend had the smoked pork ribs. We were both extremely pleased with the food. In addition, we had excellent service from the staff. Will highly recommend friends who love fried chicken to give this place a try. Just to point out, Sands rewards card holders will get a discount at this restaurant."
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",3,17-Jul-17,"Definitely not your granny's Southern cookin'; high-end with high prices to match!  This restaurant is by the same people that operate Yardbird in South Beach Miami. (Miami? That's a little too far South) The menu had almost all the Southern favorites I used to eat regularly when I lived in Atlanta. Fried chicken, collard greens, biscuits, cornbread, shrimp n grits, fried green tomatoes. The chicken and waffles were good, with the waffles fluffy and the chicken mostly crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside (except for 1-2 pieces that were a bit dry).  I was particularly impressed by the fried green tomato blt, basically a re-imagined appetizer of fried green tomato slices with pork belly and cheese slathered on top. The peach cobbler had a crisp crust and nice balance of cinnamon and vanilla. It takes 25 mins to get out of the kitchen but I felt it was worth waiting for. Everything was really a high-end restaurant take on traditional dishes, immaculately plated and great service and presentation.  The only menu items I didn't see were fried okra and pecan pie. Prices were also rather high, S$45 for the fried chicken n waffles, and S$25 for the peach cobbler. Definitely not your everyday dinner hangout spot.  We're pretty far away from the Mason-Dixon line, but I think I found a place to get familiar favorites. 3.5 stars due to the dry chicken and the elevated prices, 4 stars for the good service."
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,6-Aug-17,"Recommended by the Sands concierge service, hot and new. I am glad that I was there. I just squeezed myself out from the travel revolution held in the Sands Expo; eagerly looking for a place to settle down so I could go through the package details. It's a nice decent restaurant and it's not hard to tell by looking at how the host and hostess suited up. I was led to my table after got my name (I didn't have any reservation, it is solely for the purpose of greeting me and to make me feel respected). The waiter who attended to me was very polite and well trained who knows the menu very well. After found out the portion and the wine list, I decided to have the crab cake egg Benedict with a glass of Chardonnay. Trust me, the crab cake is simply awesome. It's not like some of the restaurants make the crab cake with 80% of batter and only 20% of crab meat. This one is opposite, you could get a mouthful of crab meats, so fresh and so yummy and the egg Benedict is perfectly done. It is heavenly delicious when you mix the egg yolk with the lemon hollandaise sauce ... mmmm..... Well, back to the reality ... time to settle the bill. The crab cake cost $30, while the Chardonnay is $25... not cheap but worth it."
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",2,30-Jul-17,"Let's start with fried chicken being my favorite guilty pleasure. When I saw that The Bird opened up, I was eager to try. Since relocating to Singapore, I am always on the hunt for some tastes of home. I asked the waiter about how the chicken is prepared. It turns out they brine but do not use buttermilk. The best fried chicken recipes use buttermilk because it makes the chicken more juicy. My top ""fried chicken"" restaurants are Ad Hoc and Red Rooster. You can google for their recipes online and they all include buttermilk.  The fried chicken at The Bird was ok, kind of like Popeye's (an US fast food chain) but at a much higher price. I asked for gravy which they said was only used in their gnocchi pot pie. I see now on my receipt, they charged me $5 for it. The gravy was trying to be a country gravy with vegetables and sausage. However all you tasted was rosemary. I did not taste any of the sausage or vegetables at all. Kind of odd to have rosemary in a country gravy if you are a Southern style restaurant. As for the gnocchi pot pie, it really was just odd. Sometimes restaurants try to be clever but this just did not work for me. Gnocchi with a rosemary gravy and a puff pastry crust?? hmm  The mac and cheese was so so. The corn bread was good. I asked for extra butter. Good thing they did not charge me for that. I did like their presentation. It was cute to see the sides in small cast iron pans. The bill came to $198 for two people. I asked if they could do something for my friend's birthday. Their answer was for me to order a dessert and they will write something on the plate for me. Don't most restaurants typically give you a small dessert for free? They did when I took my friend to Jaan for his birthday."
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",4,16-Jul-17,"A new restaurant to the Shoppes at Marina Bay and a welcome addition. My girlfriend and I have been two weekends in a row now and are very impressed with the food.  The menu pricing seems a bit off, as the Swine Burger is one of the cheaper menu offerings at $26, while a plate of chicken and waffles rings in at $45. The burger was all around fantastic--a mix of short-rib, chuck, and brisket, topped with pork belly--and is one of the best burgers you can find in Singapore. The fried chicken is excellent as well, and the macaroni and cheese is a must try.  The only disappointment to speak of was dessert. We tried the Mississippi Mud Pie Flower Pot, which was quite small and just OK. At $18, it was hardly worth it, and I would be reluctant to try any of their other desserts, which all seem to hover around that same price point.  Lastly, the service during both of our visits was very friendly. We will certainly be back for more!"
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",4,25-Aug-19,Loved this place. It is in the mall but has a great atmosphere. Got the fried chicken and it was very good. The sweet tea was right on point as well. It is very pricey but it is Singapore.
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,1-Jun-19,Amazing! From the States and love BBQ and this was awesome. The chicken wings starters were the best wings I've ever eaten. Ribs were cooked to perfection and the burgers were excellent. Best meal I've had in ages.
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,2-Oct-17,Good authentic modern twist on southern hospitality  Had fries .. yeah with bacon salt not much on food but great place away from crowded ce la vi  Bourbon cocktails are excellent..  Give it a try..
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",4,9-Oct-17,"Any American looking for a taste of home: this the spot. I am all for exploring and taking in the local flavors, but after a while in a strange land, I could use something safe and familiar.  Pros: Real Southern style fried chicken and biscuits. Also has a wide selection of Kentucky bourbon, which seems to be Asia's least favorite whiskey.  Only downside was price. It was in line with the area by higher than usual for fried chicken."
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,18-Mar-19,"Awesome!!! It was so good I had to go back another day. If you are ever in Singapore please go eat here, the food is good as well as the service.. everyone is so welcoming at this location.."
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",4,29-Dec-18,"It was my first visit here and I'm not disappointed! We had the Mac & Cheese, which featured 5 cheeses and was very more-ish. The Grilled Chicken Sandwich was good but the chicken served to us was slightly pinkish still (I noticed this only when reviewing the pictures I took before eating) thankfully, it went down well with 0 salmonella issues! The sandwich comprised of 2 generously buttered slices of Texas thick toast and some pimento cheese, which was really yummy! We shared some buttermilk biscuits, and the biscuits themselves were fairly tasty, the honey butter and jam accompanying it was just okay. The honey butter needed a fluffier texture I think to complement the dougheyness of the biscuit, so a whipped honey butter would've been nicer. All in all, a pleasant meal and I would come back :)"
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,25-Jun-18,Top notch service. Great southern food with an upscale twist. Great vibe with old school classic music playing. Best meal I had in Singapore. The Burt ends are to die for.
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,4-Aug-17,Cool "southern" atmosphere and great American food. Awesome Mac and cheese with bacon!
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",5,13-Aug-17,I love this restaurant ! Used to go when I lived in Miami and I am sooooo glad it has finally arrived in Singapore.
Yardbird Table & Bar,4.3,32,"American, Bars",1,12-Aug-17,they totally forgot my friend's birthday when i made a special request during reservation and when we arrived i confirmed it with the staff again. they didnt waive the service charge even when i told them to. food was ordinary and not worth the $45 for half a fried chicken.
Elllenborough Market Cafe,5,1,Buffets,5,2-Feb-23,"Wow! Huge assortment of standard western fare of scrambled eggs breakfast meats, pancakes etc with variety of juices and breads  Also included are cultural cuisine like curry, dim sum, made to order soup, salad and much much more.  Mostly very well executed with attentive service"
Su Korean Cuisine,5,1,Korean,5,5-Jan-14,Took a gamble and this turned out to be awesome. I was stuffed and they kept bringing out more great tasting food that I didn't know was included when ordering. Highly recommend!!!! Inexpensive for all that you get...
Sun Asian Bistro,5,1,"Restaurants, Food",5,30-Jul-12,"The SUN Asian Bistro was where I decided my 21st birthday with friends some years ago. I picked this restaurant because I liked the ""cheena"" feel and also because it gave me the most value for my budget back then. I wanted to have some privacy, so I reserved a room and ordered a seven course dinner for ten people for around $250.  The restaurant serves Asian and Western cuisine. I opted for a Chinese-style dinner, as the menu included all my favourite dishes, like crispy cereal prawns, lemon chicken, tom yum and braised kalian with oyster sauce. The food was excellent and my friends and I enjoyed the ambience thoroughly. We were also impressed with the service provided. The service staff were so efficient clearing our plates and serving us throughout the course of the dinner, one friend said they were almost like ninjas. Furthermore, the manager was very accommodating when I needed to change plans.  This restaurant provides good food, good service at good, reasonable prices. I'd definitely come back here for future celebrations!"
Schmear,4,1,American,4,15-Mar-20,"I have been nostalgic of the NY style bagels that I feel in love with. Just plain good old bagel with a cream cheese spread. And Schmears delivered on all points! When I first bite into my toasted bagel, I was home in NYC again. Love the chilled out vibe in this place and also love that the owners hail from NY, so they defo knew their stuff! Highly recommend!"
Padi,5,4,Singaporean,5,11-Jun-23,"Cosy, comfortable dining room, lightly air-conditioned. Good menu options. We were there for tea and enjoyed a teh tarik with durian cake and pisang goreng dipped in soy chili sauce- delicious. Wait staff was friendly and accommodating."
Padi,5,4,Singaporean,5,10-Apr-23,Had a really nice meal here with a friend. Lively street scene after sunset during Ramadan. All the food was good and interesting dishes. Attentive staff have good service.
Padi,5,4,Singaporean,5,16-Dec-18,"Very good traditional Singaporean food. Also the only restaurant on the street not trying to get every single tourists, generally a good sign ;)"
Padi,5,4,Singaporean,5,28-Jul-17,Very good taste! A must have if you are in Singapore!!!! I had an amazing traditional dish.
Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4.3,13,Cantonese,5,2-Jul-22,Came by for lunch the other day and it was a tasty experience!  Ordered the small shrimp paste chicken and it was delicious! The chicken was very fresh and lightly fried! The dipping sauce was spectacular too!  The sambal kang kong was also excellent! Super fragrant dried shrimp and a decent portion of kang kong!  There's a restroom towards the back of the air conditioned restaurant.  They take Visa and do not have a service charge.  $25/person after GST. Remember to bring your own napkins!
Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4.3,13,Cantonese,3,14-Mar-16,"There are a lot of Zhi Char places in Singapore that is pretty good, and mostly under rated. This one is over rated.  Let's talk about what's good.  Prawn paste chicken is pretty good, not the best, but pretty good. The dish came out piping hot, and a bite into the crispy wing reveals moist juciy meat, slight oil can be seen flowing out between those muscles. Cooked just right. The skin is lightly battered and crunchy crisp. The taste is obviously prawn paste, but it's just a tad light. Maybe some customer like it, I prefer more oomph.  Balacan kang kong. The balacan is very good. Just enough pungent, bits of shrimps, brings out the softness of those leaves. The stalks, however, is too hard. Some might say crunchy, probably, but they could have cooked it slightly longer and still come out crunchy. The chef can cook the stalks first and let the steam cook it under cover for a minute or two longer, then dump the rest of the leaves into the wok to stir. That way the stalks will be less hard, and the leaves will s be perfect. Yes. I am picky.  The seafood yee mee (brown noodles) is a disappointment. The noodles is chewy, the squid is chewy, the fish is decently fresh, but those soda-water soaked prawns looks so good that it actually taste bland. On the whole, it's the blandness of the brown sauce on the noodles. Probably forgotten to add salt, or msg, or both, or even a tad bit of artificial flavouring could have save it from such a disappointment. Alas.  These three dishes is those standard Zhi Char dishes that almost everybody gets it right. Someone dropped the ball this time. Maybe its a different chef, maybe this chef has a lousy day, whatever.  Average out a three stars from me @$30.50."
Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4.3,13,Cantonese,4,11-May-19,"Really good family restaurant. My family's been going to this restaurant for years. The quality has gone down slightly in recent years but still really good.  FOOD is nothing fancy, just your regular zi char place with home-style food. Fast and reasonably priced.  SERVICE is so-so. Cleanliness could also be better. They allow you to bring your own bottles of wine."
Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4.3,13,Cantonese,4,6-Jul-16,"Good simple zichar food. Loved the san lou hor fun, hotplate tofu and must order the prawn paste chicken. The accompanying sambal was nice too. The tofu hotplate has a couple of prawns, eggs and the minced meat sauce goes very well with white rice. Very tasty. Medium portion serves about 4-5 pax. For a group of 4 pax, we ordered a large plate of vegetable, one medium plate of san lou hor fun, medium prawn paste chicken wing and tofu hotplate. Plus 3 bowls of white rice to share. Pretty filling and would be just nice for 5 pax.  The place accepts cash only. Get the receipt/coupon from the cashier for carpark rebate."
Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4.3,13,Cantonese,5,26-Oct-12,"forty-three thirteen. no, that's not their unit number. that's the price of dinner including drinks!  we had fried rice, XO fish noodle soup, hae chor, prawn paste chicken and pork ribs with bitter gourd.  service is super fast, efficient and friendly. between placing our orders and me going to the car park to top up my cash card, the fried rice was already on the table awaiting my return.  you can smell the wok hei from the fried rice and you can hear the wok hei firing on all cylinders in the kitchen!  by 7pm, the crowd has descended upon us, so do make a reservation if you plan to eat late.  a clean, cooling and comfortable dining environment.  the hae chor is crispy on the outside but the processed minced filling could be more chunky.  the prawn paste chicken here is one of the best i have had, period. super crispy with distinct prawn paste taste but not overpowering and the wings remain moist and tender within.  pork ribs stir fried with bean paste, mushrooms and bitter gourd was delicately balanced in taste. sweet, salty, spicy and bitter all at once. their treatment of the bitter gourd resulted in it being well cooked and not overly bitter. the pork ribs were also full of tender meat.  the fish noodle soup comes with your choice of thick or thin vermicelli, with XO or not, with milk or not. the fish in our case was the thick cut belly portion but totally boneless and fried. the milk and XO adds a rich and sophisticated finish to a simple hawker dish. the resultant tasty broth will have you begging for more. again it is one of the best in the game.  lastly, there's no service charge and you can redeem $1.28 in parking, just give the cashier your car plate number in exchange for a redemption ticket."
Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4.3,13,Cantonese,5,30-Jul-13,"Really is THE best Cantonese food around.  Super authentic, mouthwateringly delicious and incredibly reasonable, I don't know what more you could possibly ask for. I have been coming here for years and often crave it when I'm back in LA.  Sure, Singapore is full of delicious Chinese food - we are, after all, a food hub. However, every dish here is cooked to perfection... and that's what sets Hong Kong Street apart from other Cantonese restaurants, in my opinion.  There are so many yummy dishes here, I go through phases of ""favorites"". My current favorite? The Pa Ting Yu (Steamed Silver Catfish - I ask for mine with their black bean sauce)... Firstly, the fish is steamed to perfection (moist, melt-in-your-mouth goodness). Secondly, the sauce is on point. (I tend to steer away from Black Bean sauces because of how salty it usually is) However, this one is anything but! You can tell they make their own sauces (or at least that's what it tastes like), not something out of the bottle. Bursting with flavor, yet, not salty at all.  Another dish I like is their Sum Lor Hor Fun (Sliced Fish Hor Fun) which, if you aren't familiar, is stir fried flat rice noodles with bean sprouts and sliced fish in gravy. Not soupy, but not dry noodles either. It isn't, however, the black singaporean Hor Fun you might be used to. (I like this one because I feel like it's healthier than normal Hor Fun - whether or not it actually is, might be another story haha)  A few other favorites include the Milky Fish Noodle Soup, Salted Fish Fried Rice, Prawn Paste Chicken, Deep Fried Cereal Prawns, Pork Ribs...  The place is clean with air-conditioning and the service is good.  However, I tend to always take my food to go (maybe I just like eating in the comfort of my home haha) But we usually buy a bunch of dishes from here to-go for dinner when we're too lazy to cook (or have guests over)... Just call ahead and they'll have it ready for you to pick it."
Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4.3,13,Cantonese,4,11-Nov-16,"Very good neighbourhood eatery. Caters well for families and well priced! Recommends: Coffee Pork ribs, fried fish fillet noodles in soup (must add more wine, with milk), cereal prawn, homemade tofu with minced meat, prawn paste chicken wings!! And the steamed yam paste dessert (onnee? ) not so sure how do you spell it haha"
Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4.3,13,Cantonese,5,11-Jan-19,"Love the fish maw soup, always so tasty and having that luxurious texture. The dishes are all of a certain standard, good food as a whole and I must say very good value, with reasonable prices. I often call in for takeaway and the staff is always very friendly to deal with, for a hassle free pick up in takeaways and even more so a very pleasant dine in experience. Do note it can get rather packed at peak hours like Saturday dinners, a reservation in advance will be good!"
Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4.3,13,Cantonese,3,5-Oct-14,"Probably the restaurant that we frequent the most in Singapore. So, why the 3 star rating?  We go here often - sometimes once a week (usually Sundays) for take away/carry out - but it can be uneven. We get most often the cereal prawns, ginger beef, sweet and sour fish, kai lan and broccoli. The kiddo likes the fried rice. When it is good (3 times out of four), it is quite good and very convenient for a quick Chinese take out dinner."
Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4.3,13,Cantonese,5,3-Apr-18,"Food here is always so wonderful, and the best thing is that everything is reasonably priced. A few must orders are the sambal kang kong, the prawn paste chicken and the cereal prawns/soft shelled crab. Would recommend to anyone looking for a place for a gathering with family/friends."
Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4.3,13,Cantonese,4,15-Aug-13,"Im not a big fan of cantonese food (gasps) but im coerced into going bc the wife is cantonese(jk). But yeah, we always get the fried (prawn paste) chicken which is good and the steamed fish. I think my review is a little biased bc as i mentioned, im not a huge fan of cantonese food. Howver, the service is great and the few types of food i do eat is good."
Hong Kong Street Family Restaurant,4.3,13,Cantonese,5,2-May-15,Highly recommended. One of the best zi char stall in Singapore. Most dishes ordered are above average.
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,5,13-Feb-16,Large apple tea ($4.50) - 3.5 stars  Ambience - 5 stars Came here to play a board game with friends in the afternoon when it wasn't too crowded. Perfect!
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,5,13-Sep-21,"Marche is always always amazing. The food is fresh and delicious, the ambience cosy and warm. My go-to is the plain rosti (with sour cream and spring onions), chicken schnitzel (fried tender chicken breast with potato salad and cranberry jam) and sometimes a strawberry shortcake or mushroom soup. The crowd is alright on weekdays but be prepared to queue on weekends. I also recommend the pizzas, pastas and wraps. Everything is good here! They use a card payment system, so you'll be given a Marche card upon entry, and you use this card to pay for your food around the restaurant. Prices are reasonable for the quality. A rosti is about 10+ and the schnitzel about 15+. Highly recommended!"
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,3,13-Jul-15,"I haven't been to Marche in over 10 years, and my friends wanted a place with a variety of food to suit everyone's tastebuds, so we choose Marche. If you don't want to queue a tleast 20 minutes on a thursday night at 7pm, make a reservation.There are lots of tables, some are bar top, and some are booths and some are just typical tables which you can join together to accomodate a big group.  1. Watermelon Juice The watermelon juice tasted okay, nothing special. I would rather go elsewhere to get this watermelon juice.  The rosti station had one of the longest queues! You can pick to have your rosti with sausages, smoked salmon and more. With so many potatoes placed here to decorate the stall, I wonder how much potatoes do they use on a daily basis.  2. Rosti with Smoked Salmon $16.90+ I loved how generous they were with the smoked salmon, covered the entire plate of rosti! The smoked salmon wasn't too salty, it was perfect and the rosti was crispy on the top layers and soft and warmed to perfection in the center. This was exactly how I remembered it 10 years ago. It seems quality standards remained the same over the past decade! *applause*  3. Rosti with Sausages I picked both the chicken cheese sauage and the pork garlic sausage. The chicken cheese sausage was very juicy and flavourful. The pork garlic sausage (the shorter one) was a bit more dry and slightly harder to cut into. The sour cream added more flavour to the sausages.  While waiting for my Rosti to be cooked, I watched this chef twirl and spin the pizza dough in the air, it was quite amazing and it made me want to try the pizza.  4. Onion Chicken Pizza The pizza looked fine, till we cut it up and saw the amount of oil in it. The onion was more for decoration as it seemed pretty raw. The chicken cubes were tiny and the cheese wasn't sufficient enough. The outside crust was crispy but the inner pizza was dough and pretty much all the ingredient slid right off the pizza. Very disappointing.  5. Pasta Cheesy goodness and even the brocolli tasted awesome. A decent plate of pasta with simple flavours from the ham and brocolli  6. Roasted Half Chicken with Sausages The chicken was very tender and juicy, even the breast meat was juicy. The sausages here were the same as the ones that came with the smoked salmon.  7. Salad The salad seemed fresh, however there wasn't sufficient dressing on the salad.  All in all, there were some hits and misses, and Yes I will go back for more rosti goodness, but I was surprised to see the bill of $140 for 4 pax. Is the food fresh? Yes sort of, I mean I can't say it's super fresh, but I know I didn't get sick from eating it. But the price just doesn't justify the quality of food we received."
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,4,7-Jan-17,"Came here on New Year's Eve (2016) and as expected, long lines were formed outside the restaurant.  While queuing, one of the staffs asked the crowd (including my friend and I) whether there was a party of two. My friend spotted it pretty quickly and hence we jumped the queue and was given the seat near to the kids' playground (slide).  This restaurant do not have much seats available so you might have to wait till other patrons to be done with their food. Compared to the one in Somerset 313, it was narrower. There were plenty of choices (salad bar, crepes, pasta, rosti, dessert, beverages, etc). Upon going into the restaurant, you will be given a card that will be used to swipe the food or beverages you choose from the different sections and pay when you are about to exit the restaurant. The good part about this concept is that the crowds will not walk in and walk out from the same set of doors.  I was craving for crepes and hence decided to go for pulled beef with pumpkin sauce. There was a line at that section but I was able to retrieve my order fast. My friend ordered the Smoked Salmon Rosti and it came out much later as there were longer lines formed there.  Food wise, I love the crispy crepes and the ingredients were of perfect blend. The beef was chewy and juicy just like I wanted it to be. The portion was more than I expected. For the Smoked Salmon Rosti, it was my first time trying. Love the combinations of the salmon and the rosti. The crisp blended well with the slimy salmon slices. Would probably prefer it to be more smoked salmon slices on this dish.  My friend decided to get sweet crepe for dessert. She chose banana chocolate crepe topped with rum ice cream. The banana were generous and the chocolate was not too sweet. This dish was not too sweet as I thought it will be by its look.  Overall, this family friendly restaurant has tons to offer. From the indoor decoration to creating a space for the children so that the adults can chit chat. Price wise it is costly but I would not mind to spend a little more once in a while for good food :)"
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,3,29-Sep-16,"Probably a place that is interesting for children and kids because you can walk around the marketplace, look at the food being prepared etc.  Saturday night at Vivo city is a hungry diner's nightmare. We stood in line for about 30 minutes to be seated.  The food is OK. Nothing wow but nothing inedible as well. Mostly all cooked to order, which is nice and also the kids can watch the service staff do their jobs. I got the roasted chicken crepe and the cook behind had the sulkiest face. Bleh."
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,4,24-Aug-15,"Today I tried the pork knuckle half-size with ginger beer. Mach¨¦' price is on the high end and thus this meal is close to $30. Having said that, the pork knuckle tasted fine in that the meat is not too salty and the skin is crispy. The problem is that the skin looked burnt and not very much appetizing.  The ambience is good. I came at 6.30pm and there were plenty of seats. It's now 7pm and this place is packed. Suggest to arrive early to pick the best seats."
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,5,22-Feb-15,"I go in cycles where I get obsessed with restaurants and this is my latest. I think there was a five day span last month where I ate here six times. The problem of sorts is that there are so many options that I can go twice in one day and have very different meals.  The soups are good and seem to be made by hand with fresh ingredients. The fish seems extremely fresh. The rosti enables me to eat what is essentially a cake of french fries and not feel as bad about it because it is so fresh, and the raclette is divine. German sausage also goes well with it. My fiance loves the paella. The savory crepes have a little too much cheese but are good. The salads are wonderful except for the flies that usually surround the lettuce. The only thing I would definitely never have again here is the pasta, which comes in a watery soup-like tomato-flavoured liquid with awkward cubes of vegetable.  The sweet crepes with mascarpone taste lighter than they probably are. I didn't like the plum dessert because it tastes like it is just plums cooked in a pie crust full of egg. The lemon meringue pie is so so so good. They are owned by or somehow affiliated with Moevenpick, which means they also have a case full of some of the best ice cream in the world, imported from Switzerland.  Although revealing this holds a risk of making the lines even longer at checkout, one of the main draws of this place is that they discount about three items to $10-$13 each day for lunch, with a free drink. So it is kind of like they are encouraging variety."
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,4,12-Mar-16,"Ah, Marche, how I remember you from my junior college days. You were such a fad back then, the coolest restaurant concept in town. You've grown up and so have I.  Your outlets are all kid-friendly, with ample play area for the little ones to run around in. They are also daddy-friendly, with a selection of beers and desserts.  I've moved on from the cheap and good old rosti, and now go for the salads and seafood paella, which comes with enough chicken to share with my toddlers.  (I spent $97.70 for 4 adults and 2 toddlers.)"
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,5,26-Feb-18,"Located off the HarbourFront MRT station and can be found at the top level, where Sentosa is. If you're craving western style cuisine, mainly european options, this place is for you. Upon entering, you'll be given a card where you take with you to order food from many stations. You will be charged on this card where at the end, you bring to the cashier to be rung up. You pay your food at the end. Stations include an ice cream, crepe, and juice bar. There's a seafood, pasta, and meat station. Plenty of seating and in an cooled area. The AC is not blasted on high, but just enough to keep you comfortable. Everything is made to order, so that's great and you can be assured that your food has not been sitting under a heat lamp. Must go and a great place to get all of your western style cravings."
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,4,17-Feb-14,We had: 1) Pasta Gratin with Pork & Mushroom - the cheese top crust is a little hard but the taste was nice. Daughter liked it enough.  2) Rosti - nice and crispy! Lovely with a generous spoonful of sour cream! Should have added a cheese sausage to complete the experience!  Would return again to fulfill that gap now!
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,5,30-May-17,"lovely place and impressive dining atmosphere, strong recommend the mashed potatoes and juice£¬ main courses was cooked elaborately and staff are friendly, definitely want to come back and try more dishes."
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,3,8-Nov-15,"it's been forever since i have been to Marche. it was at my sister's suggestion that we went and we only had desserts in mind. for a weekday lunch hour, it wasn't too crowded. The restaurant is located on the roof top of vivo city and they had tall glass windows all around so the possibility of it becoming a green house was high but they managed to keep the place nice and cool so that's a plus for sure in the hot and humid Singapore. another plus was that we quickly found the dessert station as it was less than 5 meters from the entrance.  i was hoping to get ice cream with my waffle but it was a whooping $6 for a scoop on top of the almost $10 waffle with fruits option. i was happy to forgo the extra sugar and focus on the natural mango that was fresh and juicy! the waffle was nice and crisp since it was made upon order. the lady at the station was super friendly and very generous with the toppings. thanks to her i had a satisfying meal and a pleasant time at the restaurant.  the only reason i gave it 3 stars and not more is because of the price. i guess with so many cafes in Singapore serving more outstanding and more delicious waffles, their pricing seemed steep in comparison. if i do go back to Marche, it wouldn't be for their desserts but more likely for their other items on the menu."
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,4,20-Dec-12,"My friend took me here during my stay in Singapore last year and I was blown away by the format of this restaurant.  As other reviewers have pointed out, you are given a card upon entering and you're free to use it as many times as you want at each station. Just don't get carried away with it or else you could be handing over your life savings and you wouldn't even know it. Haha.  The food was pretty tasty but to be honest, the one thing that really stood out to me was the seafood paella. I could not stop eating it and really felt like getting seconds. Except there were other food to be devoured. My friend had other dishes and we shared the wealth at our tiny table for two.  The only thing that I did not like was that it was rather cramped. I could literally hear the conversation of the table next to us, and holding hot plates of food while avoiding the crowd isn't safe.  But I know I'll be coming back here if I ever visit Singapore again. Better yet, Marche, why don't you bring this chain to the States?"
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,5,23-Aug-14,"Similar to buffet style; however, you order the items you would like prepared and they cater to your selection. Swedish restaurant (the cr¨ºpes are divine) yet the variety is plentiful and everything we had was delicious. No set price: you pay for the items that you select, but it's better than going to the market and cooking yourself. We need to have some in the USA!"
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,4,2-Sep-12,"You can recognize Marche by the Cow statue outside its store. It was one of the first restaurant to introduce the card system where all spending will be charged in a card handed to the customer and on leaving the place, produce the card to the cashier.  The outlet at Vivocity is quite small and it feels especially so during weekends. Queues will form a long way outside the store waiting to be serve. What I usually order is the rosti and the crepes.  The interior and exterior has the ambiance and design of a European farmhouse."
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,4,6-Aug-14,Food is decent and service is ok too. Not the most affordable place for the food you get but is fast and nicely located. I am a usual and will be coming back. Convinence for non Asia food this is a god place.
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,3,9-Sep-12,"Have been coming here since the first Marche opened.  What I like about eating out at Marche is the wide variety of food they have. Price wise, I've got to be honest and say it is fairly pricey, and overpriced on certain items even, but in general, the food is above average and you the quantity is good.  They use the card system here, so splitting a bill is never an issue, since you're paying for what you eat."
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,4,3-Apr-14,I like the self-serving style. Hope I've tried the lunch set on week days. It seemed quite worthy of money.
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,4,1-Jul-16,"Marche has been my favourite place for dinner for almost a decade. Back then only the vivo branch existed. Based on my experience, not all the dishes are worth trying. If this is your first time trying this restaurant, here are some of my must-try and must-not-try dishes ! Food 1. Salad bar- pretty expensive for a small bowl of salad, there are a great variety of vegetables to choose from and most of them are pretty fresh ! Rating- don't bother ordering if you wish to fill your stomach with better food. 3/5 2. Pasta - marche uses fresh ingredients and their pasta are cooked to near perfection. Rating- worth trying. 4/5 3. Meat- in my opinion, they serve the best pork knuckle in town. You definitely have to try if you are coming in groups of 4 or more. Avoid ordering the steak as they usually cook in batches which ends up overcooking the steaks. Rating- definite must try for the pork knuckle 5/5 4. Savoury crepe- unique dish that you cannot really find on other places. However, the portion os pretty big and will be better if shared. Rating- recommended 4.5/5 5. Rosti- the signature dish of the restaurant. There will always be a long queue during peak hours. However, the potato is cooked to perfection ! They use good quality oil and the portion is just nice for one person. Rating- 4.5/5 6. Pizza/rice- only tried once for each dish. Pizza gives lots of toppings and the serving is huge ! The rice is pretty ordinary. Rating-3.5/5 7. Seafood - calamari rings are nothing special and do not taste that different from outside. Quite overpriced. Rating- 2.5/5  Drinks 1. Fruit juice- i do not recommend buying their fruit juice. They will pre-squeeze the drinks in the afternoon and leave it for the rest of the day. Hence they are not really fresh. They charge pretty high for the drinks too. Rating- 2.5/5 2. Fruit teas - has always been my preferred choice of drink over the years. They serve different selection where you can try before ordering. Rating -4/5 3. Beer/non-alcoholic drink- they serve a wide selection of non-alcoholic drinks and their beer/wine are also quite unique. Rating-3.5/5  Deserts 1. Cakes and tarts- they have a wide selection of pastries to choose from and most of them taste really good ! However you will be usually too full to eat more than a slice after meals. Rating- 4/5 2. Crepes/waffles- my favourite desert is the crepe of the week. No other restaurants have this uniqe dish. However the taste usually varies with the pastry chef. There are days when the crepe taste heavenly and days when it taste like soggy prata. I would recommend getting this crepe in somerset for better quality. Rating- 4/5"
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,1,21-Aug-13,Quite disappointing.  I have had Swiss food and this is not the best for sure. No where near it. The rosti and sausage tasted stale and the meatloaf was over cooked.  Not recommended.
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,5,19-Aug-12,"I can't decide if I like this Marche or the one at 313 Somerset the most. I find that both Marches make you 'get lost in time'. You can really take your own sweet time to dine and catch up with friends over food, without worrying you'll be chased out. What's more, it's got a nice and warm environment. Marche at VivoCity is kind of on its own at the third floor; so you have to walk out from the food court side to reach the restaurant. The usual thing I like about Marche is the nice variety of food, and considerably affordable prices. Also, what you see is what you pay, since there is no additional ++. Thumb up for a like!"
March¨¦,4,22,Restaurants,5,21-Nov-12,Nice layout and easy to walk around to order food. Love the potato based foods and chicken variety.
Merci Marcel,5,1,French,5,29-Jan-23,"Very quaint place for a nice dinnner. Had the cheese plate with 7 cheeses and had the duck. Kelvin, our waiter, was an absolute pleasure. He made sure we were well taken care of! I made reservations in advance and they do take your credit card info to hold your reservation and may charge a cancellation fee if you don't cancel within a certain time."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,26-May-24,"It has all the ambience you'd expect from a fancy chic place but the music was really good on the Sunday night. Friendly service team. They were out of foei gras when I got there just an hour into service! Otherwise the patatas, croquet and lamb tasted good. Beware of small portions but my doctor would approve in view of my belly."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,2-Jul-23,"Food: Really good. Super small portions for appetizers. We got the mushroom croquets, Parmesan and mushroom churros, lamb shoulder, beef tartare, and scallops and all were delicious. Elevated dining  Ambience: We sat at a shared table but it wasn't packed around 6PM so it was fine. Cute decor though.  Service: Fairly attentive. Drinks do come out slowly though."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,5-Sep-23,Very delicious eats! The staff was very attentive and friendly with suggestions. Ordered some shareables that were very tasty!
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,9-Apr-24,Pizza and ambiance service also is good. Ideal for friends and family gathering. Good wine place
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,19-May-19,"Went here for dinner last Friday, excellent tapas place, almost all the dishes we had were great, especially the patatas bravas and the shrimp in ajillo sauce as well as the iberico ham with scrambled eggs. The flaming rum baba was innovative too. The only thing that missed the mark were the peppers with salt, they were just way too bitter, probably shouldn't have ordered them. Solid 4.5 stars overall."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,9-Sep-19,"FOC describes itself as a fun and relaxed Spanish restaurant with its roots in the Catalonian region, precisely Barcelona.  It features exquisite tapas and dishes that will leave you craving for more.  If you want to be close to the action and witness how every dishes are carefully executed, I suggest to take a seat at the bar.  We ordered Saut¨¦ed Cauliflower with pine nuts, the Octopus Galician style, and the Scallop & Soy Caviar. My personal favourite was the Cauliflower but all the dishes were definitely satisfying to the palate and quite flavourful.  We also ordered two specials: the Suckling Pig and the Tuna Salad. Again, delightful.  One item we observed being prepared several times and had our attention was the Squid Ink Paella; maybe next time.  Enjoy !!"
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,13-Nov-18,"Very good Spanish tapas place - we particularly like the more classic tapas items like garlic shrimp and croquette. Other dishes e.g. roasted chicken, cauliflower tapas, etc. are standard good. Extensive wine selection and good desserts.  Modern lively ambience and decent service. A good place to check out for Spanish tapas in Singapore."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",3,11-Nov-17,"Wasn't too bad or too good. Because it's popular you have a time limit to eat your meal . We tried 7 dishes and the one that really hit the mark was the scallop . You f you are a penny pincher then do not go . If you eat slow then do not go , if you enjoy good food and cocktails then it's a must !  The photo shows squid ink paella , nice taste would order again"
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,23-Apr-19,"Say what? Catalan cuisine in Singapore...my life is now complete.  Beautiful plates of tapas and expertly crafted cocktails. Croquettes, croquettes, croquettes...order dozens.  The Patatas bravas are a favorite of mine; these were average.  Cod balls are yet another favorite and these did not disappoint. The Spanish octopus was perfectly prepared - tender.  Three words, squid ink paella. Do it. Briny sea-worthy delight.  The ambiance is plush, rhythmic and romantic."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,27-Feb-16,"This place has a real NYC vibe for restaurants. Great tapas spot with food from Spain. The chef is a Michelin star chef and his food was legit. Staff was really nice like everyone in Singapore usually is. We ordered the lamb chops, beef sliders , cod fish balls, some mushroom dish and I forgot the last item. But everything was legit and tasted good. Would def come here again. I would suggest to def make a reservation. They book up quick as it is a trendy spot.    Peace from Doctor P"
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,29-Jul-15,"I get the hype.  This place is buzzy (even on Mondays), with quirky decor, great music, and top notch food. The cocktail menu doesn't seem to end, and I love how they break it down by easily identifiable flavour profiles like refreshing, floral, and spirit driven. I tried the Lord Sidecar- loved the sage and it was a great starter for a hot and humid day.  I was surprised at the patatas bravas- their rendition had a saucy kick to it. The grilled foie gras sliders were very rich, definitely a treat meant to be filed under ""sometimes food only""! My husband and I were also impressed with the Black Mediterranean Squid Ink Paella. A mouthful to say, but when that mouthful's in your mouth, it's damn shiok.  My only constructive feedback was that it was slightly warm where we were sitting. We were at the end table opposite the bar/kitchen. I noticed we weren't that far from the ceiling AC unit; not sure if it was on at all."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,27-Oct-15,"The food, throughout the night, did not disappoint.  We had the croquette as a starter.  Minus half a star for not having the foie gras slider when we visited last Friday. It was a dish I really wanted to try, but it was not available.  We ordered beef slider, which was tasty, but I guess it was just that. The fried squid was definitely tasty, however, it came in small portion. The special of the day, cauliflower, was really good and crunchy. The fish and cheese (mac and cheese ball lookalike thing) was spot on. You gotta try this when you visit. Another highlight is the black squid ink paella. I could come back again just to have a paella to myself, if they are not so particular about the whole reservation sms and dining duration. The pork ribs were good, but not wow. Overall, everything we have ordered that night is above average. I would definitely be back to try more dishes.  Minus another half a star for the pain of having to reserve on the phone with the missus who have hearing problem and make a fuss about replying ""confirmed"" by 3pm the next day and endless reminders that we have to leave by certain timing."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,24-Feb-17,"Who would have thunk it - Catalan cuisine in Singapore...my life is now repleat with fullness ;-)  They serve expertly crafted cocktails and Beautiful plates of tapas.

FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,20-Jun-18,"Excellent food and service. We are all small tapas and took their recommendations. The atmosphere is great too. Little pricey, and you probably need reservations but worth it!"
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,3-Oct-14,"I asked my friend Ning when she would be free to celebrate her mid November bday..and she said let's do dinner this Thursday. She's busy with med school so she has to seize the day (evening). She said try FOC? I had heard of it but had thought another tapas bar ok whatever.  Made bookings early..ok left a voice message to callback to add an additional person and they didn't call. FOCING service I thought to myself but I called back and they were helpful as can be. Thereafter, it was all uphill.  We arrived just before 7pm on a Thurs night and the place was getting full. We hadn't asked but they had given us 3 girls counter seats on the leftmost side of the counter right in front of Chef Jordi. Getting to ask him about the food (even the ones not destined for us), watching him and the other staff hard at work, chatting about his recommendations and preferences really added to the experience.  We had Croquetas de setas (Mushroom croquettes) $8. Cuatro unidades (4 units). Sorry the nod goes to Binomio on this one. The batter was slightly overfried (but the 4th piece which I did not eat was noticeably a shade lighter in colour than the other 3) and the inside was full of bites of (maybe?) porcini mushrooms. Tasty and mushroomy but Binomio wins for the smooth cream filling evenly exuding mushroom flavour. Both places seem to serve the croquestas on the same dab of garlic mayo..(incidentally the same garlic mayo dabbed on FOC's black rice paella and Binomio's squid ink pasta fideua).  We had a daily special recommended by Chef, he called it the huevos dish and it was basically potato pieces fried with crispy edges served with an egg on top and in a skillet. Simple but again very yummy and perfectly seasoned (ie not too salty).  One of Ning's and my favourites (Nadia doesn't like tomatoes) was the watermelon gazpacho with charcoal olive oil ice cream. We ordered one portion to share and Chef Jordi thoughtfully split the ice cream into 3 separate bowls. The gazpacho was incredibly smooth and tasty and tomatoey with just a touch of sweetness from the watermelon. Nadia doesn't like tomatoes (other than fresh ones in salad or in the background like pizza sauce) but she loved the icecream mixed with the gazpacho and ate up every last drop of her portion. That's how good it was.  Food was very tasty without being cloyinging rich and greasy which can be the risk of Spanish restaurants (in Spain as well as here!). The black rice (arroz negro) with seafood paella $22 was luscious without visible separated oil unlike Binomio and La Bomba and Sabio). The plumpness and bite of the rice was perfect, really good quality rice handled well.  Another strong recommendation by Chef Jordi, the grilled ribeye at $35 was meltingly tender and served medium rare. Originally I thought he was talking about the 1kg beef on the bone..and I asked ""Erm..too much for us 3?"". He said No! Just nice for sharing..(I was thinking OK..maybe we look very hungry) and later when I realised it was a ribeye steak portion PHEW I told him about the intiial misunderstanding and we had a good laugh about it. This was 150g and we were all commenting how tender and juicy and really good the meat was and my other 2 friends also raved on about the grilled peppers served on the side of it.  Note on the cocktails. Nadia had the Smells Like Gin Spirit $14. Tasty and refreshing gin version of a mojito. I had the Chef's favourite, Bloody Jordi also $14 and is a bloody Mary type with an Asian sour twist. Looking at the description again that must be the Kimuchi no Moto (korean kimchi base). Dario the mixologist said it had 1.5 shots of tequila in it. I couldn't taste the alcohol but he said it was not meant to be a strong alcohol forward drink. It's true the spices and tomato was the prevalent sensation and not everyone will like that flavour combination but it was interesting to try something new. My friends all commented it was so savoury like a soup and it did go down very easily. I suppose it's a silent killer but I was happy to get on to the excellent house wine - I had the Angelitos Negros 2013 at $10.50 a glass!  After all that Chef asked if we wanted a small bite each. He then prepared 3 pieces of scallops topped with their soy ""caviar"" (tapioca sago) so we could have 1 each when the standard serving is 2. Fresh juicy and plump w slight char $16.  We went through the courses very smoothly (all tapas but felt like a proper dinner all the way) and happily ended with the chocolate burger at $12 and the Torrija $10.  Overall food was fresh, not overstated, not over-seasoned, refreshing, very yummy but not bludgeoning on the palate.  A small portion of Torrija with a candle and with happy birthday written in dulce de leche on the plate was served complimentary. And unexpectedly, even the valet (from Purple Valet) waited to close all our doors for us as we got into the car. I don't know if that's part of the restaurant training but kudos."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,16-Jan-17,"We went here Saturday night at about 9pm, the restaurant was busy and the tunes were bumpin. Seriously, I was chair dancing the whole night. We went with tapas- let's be honest when given the choice why would you not, and loved EVERYTHING. We did the ham croquettes, beef cheek sliders, and saut¨¦ed cauliflower. The ham croquettes may have been the best thing I've ever tasted. Pricing for food is fair, although the wine list gets pretty extravagant although for Singapore it seems fairly normal. Come here, you will not be disappointed."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",3,19-Aug-17,"Not sure I was too happy to pay $6 for four pieces of bread but other than that, the squid ink paella had robust flavors and would come back just for more of that."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,30-Jul-17,"This Spanish tapas bar is on point. The food is fantastic, I wish I could've ordered the entire menu. The Jamon iberico ham was out of this world. The cocktails were fun and delicious!"
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,16-Feb-15,Great cocktails and great food. Do try their crackling pork and their paella. Superb! Rsvp is a must eventhough it's for weekdays .
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,18-Dec-16,"Lucky to snatch a seat at the bar on a Thursday night.. always wanted to visit FOC, and the food didn't disappoint. Food is on the pricier side, although I think the clientele probably won't blink an eye at the price. Service is great, although, for some reason, the couple dishes I ordered came out a bit saltier than im used to. Maybe I'll ask for less salt next time."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,18-Nov-15,"One of the best dinners I've had in Singapore. Service was flawless, food was amazing. Worth every cent. Great for a fun night out when you're in the mood to splurge a little. Total bill for 2 came up to $115 (incl. GST & service charge) without drinks.  We had: - Mushroom croquettes ($10 for 4). Served fresh, each croquette can be finished off in 2 delightful bites. The inside is a gooey mess of cheese, cream and mushrooms. Wonderful starter to whet your appetite. - Squid ink paella ($26). Perfect for sharing, also gorgeously photogenic. Each grain of rice was plump and flavorful and mixed with hidden octopus chunks, which was a pleasant surprise. It was topped with juicy prawns and clams and dollops of aioli. We wiped the pan clean. I must confess I never was a fan of paellas, but this one hit the ball out of the park. - Grilled octopus ($22). Juicy octopus nestled on a bed of flavorful mashed potato topped with paprika. Only minor gripe was that some parts were so charred that I ended up tasting more bitterness from the burnt bits than the actual octopus. The octopus itself, on the other hand, was tender and meaty. Absolutely delicious. - Iberico pork ribs & pumpkin mash ($30). Our least favorite dish of the night. Perhaps also because we were getting pretty full by then and this dish ended up feeling too heavy. The ribs were very fatty and the savory pork didn't go that well with the sweet pumpkin. It was decent on the whole though. - Chocolate Galaxy ($12). They bring the chocolate dome to the table and pour hot chocolate syrup over it on front of you, so you watch as the chocolate shell melts to reveal 3 mini profiteroles within. Ended up being essentially a chocolate ""soup"" with 3 cream-filled profiteroles. We didn't think we would be able to finish it, but we did! There were crunchy bits at the bottom which was a nice touch. Great for sharing.  Didn't manage to try this time, but I've also heard good things about the mini chocolate burger and the watermelon gazpacho.  Will definitely return! Love this restaurant :)"
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,7-Oct-16,"Been to FOC twice. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Plates are sometimes removed quite quickly but then again you want the space for the next dish. The food is amazing! Hands down. Dishes are well presented and are inviting to look at while having a conversation.  If you have the choice, sit at the bar. It makes the experience all the more intense and inspiring as you see all the different things the kitchen staff prepares. And they look amazing.  We had (in no particular order): oysters (daily special), beef cheek (special), scallops, peppers, bread with tomatoes (OMG!). In terms of drinks you should try the Bloody Jordi - a slimmed down house special version of a Bloody Mary. It's good, it's really good :)  On a personal note: For me a great restaurant is not only about service and food. It's what they do to encourage you back. First time around a had mixup on my bill that I only claimed later. FOC staff was really really helpful and things were resolved to satisfaction in no time. No hard time, no stalling. I will be back at FOC. Worth your time and every penny spent!  Thank you FOC :)"
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,9-Feb-19,"Very good night out. Great food, great service. My favorite tonight? Simply the Pane con Tomato and Ibetico Ham, the beautifully cooked scallops, and the lemon tarte... We will be back for sure! Very solid place!"
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,21-Jun-15,"Craft cocktails and small plates with a Western theme? Come to mama.  They impressed me when I walked in the door, the hostess squeezing me in on the spot despite no real opening for quite awhile. The waitstaff was fantastic all around.  The cozy atmosphere, the view of the kitchen and bar, and the hustling of the staff gave the place quite a bit of positive energy. The eclectic decor included a couple of large colorful busts looking down which was vaguely reminiscent of Carnival.  Quite a range of libations, I did sample a couple. I was honestly a bit disappointed with the ""Smells Like Gin Spirit""--I was hoping for a cocktail like an Aviation but got something I'd expect at a New Orleans Sno-Ball stand instead. Perhaps fitting for a balmy Singapore evening, though. The Don Martinez, however, was smoking (on many levels)--tequila-based deliciousness.  An extensive selection of Spanish themed tapas that you would expect adorned the menu. I'm sure they are delicious, but I went for the ""World Tapas"" instead. Delicate scallops, pulled pork mini-tacos, and beef-cheek sliders. Every item I ate, they completely nailed.  I loved the dessert ""burger"". I'll admit that when I first saw a picture I thought it a bit contrived and scoffed at the notion, but decided to try it anyway. It was so cute--the delicateness of the dish made it more reminiscent of a toddler's toy cheeseburger rather than a slider. Strawberry ""tomato"" and mint ""lettuce"" added to the effect. A nice thin chocolate shell crunch with a light creamy filling, it was pleasing to the palate as well as the eye.  Bravo."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,18-Jun-15,"We had five dishes.  - baby squid w/aioli - scallops - pulled pork sliders - pork belly and cauliflower - foie gras sliders  Absolutely love the sous-vide pork belly and creamy cauliflower pur¨¦e dish. Cant stop thinking about the playful foie gras and shiitake sliders or the buttery pulled pork buns.  Scallops were good, but slightly overlook from the ponzu.  Skip the baby squid. The batter on the squids were thick and made it heavy."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,11-Sep-18,"Wanted to add to the reviews as this is now one of the two best restaurants I've been to in Singapore. Hidden away on a not so great street, this place is a gem. The food was amazing, cocktails looked great (Although I had delicious wine). And it was a great ambiance. I would highly recommend this place."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,30-Dec-14,"Amazing place, never thought there would be a place like this in my home town of Singapore. I've been a fan of good tapas since my Movida experience in Melbourne, and so those familiar with that place, we have our very own cool tapas bar on our own door step now.  Its been almost a week since I've been there, and I still remember the dishes I had. The suckling pig is not something they have everyday, if they have it on the menu the day you are there, have it. I can't name many occasions when pork has melted in my mouth!  The anchovies on coca bread is a must try, as is the braised beef. And that Foie Gras, you want that flavor to stay in your mouth forever.  Here's my other recommendation, if you're in small group, ask to sit at the bar. Its not only about watching the cocktails being served up, but also watching the chef and ESC prepare all the dishes in the kitchen. Its certainly part of the experience."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,7-Nov-14,"There's a blazing fire that is out to turn up the heat on Hongkong Street and that is FOC Restaurant, a new Spanish dining concept and cocktail bar. FOC is an inspired collaboration between Michelin-starred Chef Nandu Jubany, Chef Jordi Noguera formerly from FoodBar Dada, and award-winning mixologist Dario Knox previously from Catalunya Restaurant. Yes it's a star studded team!  Expect a contemporary small plates menu with Catalan and Mediterranean influences, complemented by a selection of inventive cocktails. They even created a selection of Asian inspired tapas which were honestly pretty darn good.  HITS!  Cochifrito. Crispy Pork Taco ($14/2pcs). This is one of my favorites if not the top favorite dish. This is FOC's take on the Mexican taco, and that crispy shell was too addictive. It's like a really awesome fried wanton skin filled with tender pulled pork. I really liked the crispy pulled pork. I didn't even mind the dou miao and I don't even like bean sprouts. Now could we have this in jumbo size or what?  Bocata de foie-gras a la brasa y shitake marinado. Grilled foie-gras with marinated shitake and green apple ($22/2pcs). Loved that broiche bun with a glossy blistered exterior. It was very crunchy and extremely buttery. Even though the foie gras was on the oily side, it had a nice creamy texture and i liked that the green apples added that tinge of tartness.  FOC Hamburguesa de chocolate FOC chocolate burger ($12). Now here is one carefully crafted dessert burger made from white chocolate, vanilla mousse, strawberries and mint leaves. You should eat it all together for a balanced review of this dessert. The combined flavors of the smoky caramel, sweet milk chocolate and the tart strawberries were delightful. The cream in the 'bun' had a marshmallow texture too!  DRINKS! Innovative, strong and very affordable! They start at $13 and cocktails are available ALL DAY. Say WERTTTT!  MISSES Vieiras con caviar de soja. Scallops soy caviar ($20). It's scallops, and it's nicely seared and it's in a salty soy. There's really nothing else to it.  ""Cansalada"" confitada con pure de coliflor. Confited pork belly with cauliflower puree ($14/4pcs). Bland. Fatty. Bleah. Give me that cauliflower puree on its own."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,15-Sep-15,"Flawless meal and one of the best I've had in Singapore. If you can, try to sit at the bar so you can watch in awe as the chefs prepare plates and the bartenders make drinks.  What I had: Pork Tacos: When they first arrived, I was surprised at how small they were, but as soon as I took the first bite, I no longer wished for anything bigger. There was so much flavour packed into these little bite sized tacos, I'm still craving them a day later.  Potatoes Bravos: Delicious and delicate. A perfect starter that will not fill you up, but will make you anxiously await your next plate.  Grilled Octopus: wow. All I can say is wow. Perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned, with a perfect char. I've had quite a bit of octopus and this rivals the best I've had.  French Toast and Ice Cream dessert: How can you go wrong with this, it's a perfectly sweet dessert that isn't too sweet and not too heavy. A great way to finish a great meal.  Smells Like Gin Spirit: I was hoping for a nice refreshing cocktail and that's exactly what I got. I'm not much of a gin guy but decided to try this out and was pleasantly surprised."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,1-Nov-14,"Had dinner here on a Friday on a reservation made 2 weeks earlier. Was expecting another overrated tapas place but was pleasantly surprised.  The winners for me were the beef cheek sandwich, patatas bravas and crispy pork tacos. Would have loved to try their scallop ceviche with guacamole and grilled scallop but both weren't available. Finished off with the tarta tatin done with a modern twist which was agreeable with me.  They have an interesting, well priced and fairly extensive cocktail menu complete with a taste guide. Alas, the cocktail itself was very average. Had the red sangria which tasted rather like grape juice with added sugar.  The service here deserves commendation. Efficient and smiley, a rarity in SG. I will be back."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",1,4-Aug-17,"Quite frankly, I am not sure why this restaurant averages 4+ stars on Yelp. Of all the dishes we had tonight, only the cauliflower and duck confit were good. Scallops came out completely raw in the middle...asparagus were overcooked to the point of being mushy...not to mention we were served the fibrous bottom. If you are going to serve the bottom of the asparagus, then you may want to shave it! Cuttlefish paella with saffron came out crunchy and looking completely brown and absent of any saffron. The rice was so undercooked and it tasted very muddled. I have never seen saffron flavored rice to be brown...why would you cover up the nice yellow color of saffron...maybe it's a false item in the description and none was ever used??? Beef cheek burger was okay and lamb chops were bland."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",3,22-Dec-14,"I feel a little self-conscious, giving FOC only three stars amidst all the 4-5 star reviews so far.  The bad first, since it weighs heavily on my mind. I hate that they do two sittings, one at 6:30pm and the other at like... 9. It's ridiculous. Some of us work till 7 ish, 8, and there's no way we can wait till 9 to have dinner. So the only time I've eaten at FOC is for a work dinner, when the entire office got off work early, just so we could eat here. Other than with such special arrangements? I'm basically never going to be able to dine here on a weekday.  The food was... good. Not mind-blowing. Not amazing. Just... good. And not even enthusiastically good. Granted, I didn't order items off the menu, we had a pre-ordered selection of the menu because we were such a big group, but I think we hit many of the popular items.  The octopus was good, but not the best, or second best I've had in Singapore. The eggs scrambled at the table with fried potatoes, brilliant idea, but the hot-plate wasn't hot enough to actually cook the eggs, so we had very raw egg white, slightly cooked egg-yolk, and brilliantly crisp potato bits. The watermelon gazpacho was tasty and very addictive, and I'd definitely order it again... if I do go back. The seafood paella was popular with some, though the seafood taste got a bit overpowering by the 4-5 spoonful. Mushroom croquettas? Brilliant. Creamy, practically fall apart croquettas with a strong distinct mushroom taste. Really good. But better than a good creamy jamon croquetta? Unfortunately... no.  So maybe you'll enjoy FOC more than I did if you're a fan of cocktails. I didn't order any because I was driving, and was having wine.  But right now, I'd rather head to UNA for my tapas fix."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,26-Jan-15,"We went to dinner here on a Friday night.  The decor is cool, hip, feels like a trendy bar/tapas place in Manhattan.  We started with a cocktail that was excellent (probably the best I have had in Singapore) - Smells Like Gin Spirit - which was a perfect start-off-the-night cocktail as it was herby and refreshing. Hubby had the special gin and tonic which he really liked.  We had 5 or so tapas. Our favorites were the toasted bread and tomatoes and croquettas - classic that are hard to do wrong, but were both very good. The black paella was only okay - honestly, the paella at Pasar Bella is better. The french toast for desert was very good - carmelized, chewy french toast with vanilla ice cream - and a great way to end the night.  I will be back but might make it a cocktails and a couple of starters thing, versus an entire night as there are just so many places to try in Singapore."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",2,5-Nov-16,"Food was not as good as before. E.g., prawns were cooked too much and octopus lost its unique texture. Staff, serving a black ink paella, advised us to be careful as the pan was very hot but it turned out to be almost cold. Hahaha... it was served too late. :-(  However, I was pretty satisfied with wine selection and overall ambience. Will I visit again? Not sure..."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,15-Mar-16,"I had one of the best vacations a couple of years ago, cycling around the Catalan region eating affordable and excellent food everywhere. From Michelin-starred restaurants (which I'm not sure is the best way to assess the more traditional dishes, but then again this region was under French protection at one point ) to a home kitchen, the food in Catalunya is fantastic. If food was reason alone for granting autonomy, I say why not!  Anyway, let's leave the politics aside and talk about FOC. I didn't visit Can Jubany in Osona but I bet FOC is equally good. Spanish food by the Spanish, not too pricey and portions were sufficient (here's looking at you, Serenity). I was craving some fideu¨¤, which is like the ang moh version of hokkien prawn mee...and the chef gamely obliged with his rendition of squid ink fideu¨¤. It was very tasty with a good amount of wok hei! We also had the croquettes, which had mashed potatoes so mashed it was practically a mouth-watering puree; sardines with pickles 9gives your palate a good puckering up), fresh and very sweet tomatoes, the potatas bravas (kinda skimpy on the seasoning and not greasy...which I kind of associate with the dish but hey this will do) and the battered cod fish balls with apple puree (interesting but kind of mushy with not too distinctive flavors i.e. I couldn't tell it was cod).  Up to this point, the food came out at a steady pace and then we had a long wait. I checked on the waiter and realized the kitchen had forgotten our grilled octopus and the egg with pork belly and truffle special...while the clock was ticking on when we had to vacate our seats because of the two cover policy and because I had a show to catch at the Art House. The octopus was served shortly and much as I had hyped up my dining partner on the wonders of Spanish octopuses (they are in fact ridiculously taught, smoky, crisp and mind blowing), the FOC version kind of disappointed. Time in the Josper grill somehow robbed the octopus of its juices, though I liked the char on top, so this was an ""ehhh"" dish that could've been so much better. The eggs with pork belly and truffles (what a combo right) never came and I think I actually paid for it in my haste. I didn't check the bill thoroughly but on hindsight at $180 and some quick math off the website, I think I was charged for the dish that never went into my belly even though I would've loved to taste it.  Finally a note on the cocktails. I had the cuzco sour...because if you've hiked all over Peru you would have romantic memories of this lovely drink (not so much of the chicha). It was very balanced - the right amount of tart lime/lemon and the requisite egg whites and bitters on top. My second drink was a Bangkok something, which I asked the waiter to recommend based on my preference for something ""refreshing"". It ended up being almost exactly the same as the sour except for some supposed chilli's that were mild to non-existent. Maybe I'm being a little picky but the mark of front of house would be one that watches both your food and drink selections and offers pairings that work with the food or takes you in a different direction from your first. I felt the team fell short here though it's not surprising given how busy the restaurant was.  Nonetheless I enjoyed my meal at FOC, probably because the food and drinks came soon enough that I was willing to over look the slow service towards the end and the incorrect billing."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,10-Aug-16,Delicious food and great service for Singapore. The portions are very precious but the food is flavorful and well-prepared. I will gladly return.
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,11-Mar-16,"For a new-ish restaurant, FOC is already running like a well-oiled establishment. The staff knew the menu inside-out, so they were able to make spot-on recommendations; the arrival of our courses were timely; and our water glasses were kept topped up with big smiles.  As for the Catalan food at FOC, it was indeed superb - traditional but executed with an effortless flair so while dishes seldom deviate from the classics, flavours are rich, hearty and soulful. It's pricey, but no more expensive than any other Spanish restaurants around  We had:  1) Heuvos Estrellados con Chorizo ($10) - a breakfast hash of fried potatoes, chorizo balls and a just-cracked egg, still sizzling on the hotplate: Smoosh it all together, and you get a glorious mess of runny eggy delight. Our favourite tapas here.  2) Croquetas de Setas con Jamon ($10 for 4): a mixed platter of mushroom croquettes and Spanish ham croquettes, bursting with creamy goodness, and tempered with the contrast of the soft mash and crunchy breadcrumbed coat.  3) Tortilla Abierta con Trufa y Pimientos del Piquillo ($26): an open tortilla with blistered red peppers, truffle strips and aioli was simple but done fantastically. It was just the right balance of rich aioli, aromatic truffle, sweet peppers and eggy pancake.  4) Gambas al Ajillo ($18): a classic of sauteed prawns in white wine and garlic, notable for 2 things: the copious use of really good white wine, which made this the most heady rendition ever - I think I got a little high from this; and incredibly sweet prawns still with shells on, for maximum flavour infusion to the sauce. A tip: get bread to mop all the deliciousness up.  5) Vieiras a la Brasa con Caldo de Bonito y Caviar de Soja ($16): a couple of fat succulent scallops grilled to a beautiful caramelization, and dunked into a delicate bonito stock and topped with soy beads. Great fusion of Asian flavours  6) Costillas de Cerdo a la Brasa con Pure de Calabaza Ahumada ($30): seriously good, premium iberico pork ribs, burnished with rosemary, were grilled to a juicy smoky finish, and sided by a smoked pumpkin puree.  7) Arroz Negro con Mariscos y ""All I Oli"" ($24): perhaps the best squid ink paella I've ever had. The moreish squid ink was nuanced and countered with the creamy bite of aioli. You can't quite see it, but there was as much rice as there was squid dice, so that's really amazingly generous."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,27-Feb-17,"Been to FOC@ Hong Kong Street several times. In general, the food is excellent, especially the squid ink paella, as well as the desserts. Alcoholic drinks on menu are also very good; I think this place has one of the best pisco sours I have had in Singapore. But, the seats are too close to each other, and the acoustics of the place is horrible. It is difficult to hear conversations at the table."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,10-Nov-15,"It's a smallish place but with a confident attitude about it. The cocktail list was never ending and I tried a couple they were both excellent! The Tapas was very nice as well, bcoz we had a few vegetarians in the group we stuck to mostly vegetarian and still I loved it, the cheese platter was excellent. Overall a good lace to go again. But it's not cheap!"
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,27-Sep-16,"From start to finish, every item was perfectly executed. Cocktails were also amazing, but very small for the price."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,23-Feb-15,"It's interesting to see what passes for tapas in Singapore, but FOC really nails it down with some excellent selection of very unique plates as well as the classics. We actually just left the ordering to our server who planned the following dishes: Jamon Iberico, Scallops with soy caviar and bonito stock, beef cheek sliders, and slow cooked octopus. We really appreciated the thicker slices of jamon iberico, which allows one to fully savor the cured ham. The scallops were outstanding and totally worth the price of $18 for a pair. The beef cheek sliders was my least fave - very good flavor but not a big fan of the texture. And I loved how the octopus was paired with some earthy potato. I will definitely come back to try some of the classic tapas,but the first visit was definitely solid. Their bar program is also way above average for a restaurant with some really interesting house cocktails. But I tend to stick with the classics, and I was very happy with the Americano made with Amer Picon. The place gets packed, and with good reason. Definitely a fun place that also takes their food and drinks seriously. The small plates can definitely add up but it's also well worth the price."
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,17-Mar-16,This little restaurant and bar was a surprise to find in Singapore. The service was beyond exceptional and the food was fantastic. My favorite was the beef sliders with kimchi.

FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",4,16-Oct-16,Perfect place for intetactive eating. Definitely want to get a reservation. Try for the group tables. You never know who you might meet.
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",5,19-Apr-15,"This restaurant is just awesome! Where do I start? First of all - its a good idea to reserve a table or seats. Depending if you are interested to see how they make the food or if you just want to sit and relax with your friends. The decor is cool - reminds me of the cool kid clubs in Berlin - and the service awesome. The food: You might want to go for exercise before you enter the sinful temple of culinary highlights - as you will most likely eat more than usual because its just so good. Usually I sit at the bar and let the boss decide what he is going to serve me as so far - he never disappointed. From the gazpacho to the clams over the chorizo to the creme catalan (which is a MUST HAVE!!) everything is just amazing. I have been to Barcelona and never had such amazing tapas. The way the food is combined - the flavours, the consistency and structure is very different, surprising and every time like a food symphony. What I personally like is that the way the spices are used is so balanced that I don't need to put on extra salt or any other sauce. For me that means that a dish is perfect and that is extraordinary. Drinks: Their wine and beer selection is quite good but I normally stick to my two favourite cocktails: Old Fashion Churchill and Bloody Jordy (which - if you like body mary - is a MUST HAVE TOO!!). Last but not least - I went there once with a colleague who is vegetarian - and even for him there was a lot of choice and he really enjoyed the food too. I will keep coming back. The prices are reasonable for this kind of haute cuisine. Simply a great restaurant!"
FOC,4.3,47,"Tapas/Small Plates, Cocktail Bars, Spanish",2,18-Nov-14,"After all the buzz, the reality was disappointing. The chef seems to love to put huge amounts of salt on everything. We sent the cod back because it was so salty that it was not edible. When the lamb arrived equally as salty, we just gave up and left half of it untouched."
Hajah Maimunah,5,1,Halal,5,28-Nov-13,"Really really good Malay food. In general, westerners are a little grossed out by restaurants where the food is out in front of you, mainly due to connotations of the bad cafeteria food at we ate school. Not really sure about the pricing, but I ordered two mains and rice, and I think it cost around $4.The tofu with green beans and chili sauce and the chicken dish I had were both awesome. In general the sauces that Malays cook with are awesome: a REALLY good balance of spicy, sweet, and salty. Note that a lot of the people here were big on ordering the whole cooked fish  This place is off a side road in Kampong Glam, Singapore's old Malay hub (I could be wrong, but it's a bit more of a tourist spot than anything else now). It was pretty close to my hostel, so I don't know how far it is from the MRT- maybe a 10 or 15 minute walk from Bugis station?  This place gets crackin for lunch, so if there's no seating in the main room, have a look at the dining area next door."
Joan Bowen The Special Culinary Centre,5,1,"American, Desserts, Coffee & Tea",5,17-Nov-14,"This caf¨¦ is worth a visit if you're in the area. It's another one of those caf¨¦-in-neighborhood, except this one has a Kodak photo printing station as well, and it has a social enterprise component to their business. So rather cool.  Payment in cash, unless you're eating with several people and your bill is over $40, then Credit Cards are accepted.  Come here if you want to print photos from a Kodak photo station. And if you want good American fare, decent desserts, and all the while supporting a social enterprise. The caf¨¦ is nicely tucked inside a neighborhood with minimal parking but that shouldn't be too much of a problem."
Magurodonya Miuramisakikou Sushi,4.8,5,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,1-Aug-21,"Classic Bang for buck. Go for an Irodori bento if you want a good big meal. Otherwise definitely get the otoro over rice. Otoro is fatty tuna and theirs is fresh and will melt in your mouth. It's a bit holed away in Suntec, but during my stay in Singapore, I even became a regular...  Be sure to sign up for J points or a rewards program, you can get discounts on select days!"
Magurodonya Miuramisakikou Sushi,4.8,5,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,29-Aug-18,"For great tuna experience, trust the tuna wholesaler of Maguro-Donya Miura-Misaki-Kou! Really a charming and delicious little find inside the commercialized wonderland of Suntec City Mall.  We called in advance and made a reservation at their sushi bar, which sits maybe 10. They do have a regular dining room to sit as well. The space is small, but welcoming and the staff was happy to have us. I don't think mid-week a reservation is necessary, but if you want to sit at the bar, it might be, because space is limited.  Maguro-Donya Miura-Misaki-Kou is a tuna wholesaler first and then kind of a sushi and dining experience second (noted in the Michelin Guide book, just so you know). With that, tuna is the speciality all around on the menu in various forms and preparations. If you are looking for an extensive list of sushi choice outside tuna, this is not the spot for you. If you are looking for some exceptional tuna, you will not be disappointed. Their menu is extensive, full of all things tuna and what you see is what you get...there were no additional specials or fish items for the day.  Three things of note that makes this restaurant special...tuna quality, reasonable prices and portion size of fish being cut for sashimi and sushi preparations.  The tuna quality is exceptional! Maguro-Donya Miura-Misaki-Kou is serving up all parts of the tuna. Having ordered the toro, we were floored with the cut and the quality for such a reasonable price. We had maybe six sizably cut pieces for like $55SGD. We also ordered some salmon, tofu (not really great and would skip tofu the next time & stick to tuna & other fish) and a rainbow roll. The rainbow roll was the largest rainbow roll I have ever consumed in my entire sushi eating life. The fish on top of it was absolutely fresh and a great portion, but the sushi rice in the roll itself was moist, tasty and really excellent as well. The largest rainbow roll of your life will set you back $20SGD.  Quite honestly, note that all portions of all items are large. This is a touch unexpected, but sitting right there at the sushi bar and seeing all that they were cutting and making, we saw the giant presentations leaving the sushi chefs prep areas.  We find ourselves in the Suntec City Mall with some regularity and with that, I think we have found our new favorite spot."
Magurodonya Miuramisakikou Sushi,4.8,5,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,3-Sep-19,"This place had such great sushi!! Although, it is a lot pricier than the sushi you could get in the states. I expected singapore to be expensive so it did not surprise me. I was willing to spend my money here because I was on vacation in Singapore from America. I am also a sushi addict, so I really did not mind spending some $$$ on the sushi st this place! If I were to come back to Singapore, I would visit this place at least once."
Magurodonya Miuramisakikou Sushi,4.8,5,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",5,27-Sep-15,"This sushi joint is tucked away on the 3rd floor of Suntec Mall as one of the restaurants in ""Eat at Seven"", a group of Japanese restaurants clustered together.  Sushi is all about the sourcing. Where the sushi is obtained from, and who the chef buys his fish from. MaguroDonya is connected to a famous chain in Japan that is known for its tuna, so we're especially lucky to have it here in Singapore. The best quality of tuna is selected by a Japanese chef, and flown into Singapore for our enjoyment. The restaurant specializes in tuna (magur.) so don't expect a variety of fish. Instead, focus on the different cuts of high-quality tuna. This restaurant is for those who want high quality sushi, rather than a buffet of poor quality fish.  Of course it's not cheap, but it does beat flying to Japan. $50 for 5 types of tuna, about 2 pieces each type.  The cuts of a fish were a little cold when we got them (and presented on ice), but 30 seconds on the plate, and they warmed up to the perfect temperature."
Magurodonya Miuramisakikou Sushi,4.8,5,"Sushi Bars, Japanese",4,1-Aug-17,Great sushi at a great price if you go for lunch. A la carte prices are expensive though.  Don't be adventurous like my wife and try the cooked bluefin. It tastes like it looks (see photos)
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,28-Oct-23,"My first time trying TimHoWan and before we get in to it, some important call outs. I am Asian but look like I'm not. A lot of times this causes me pause for wonder. Now, ordering went well (I was asked to order through QR code) and food arrives quickly. I started to eat and realized they had given me chopsticks but no napkin so I asked for a napkin. The lady that brought my food said I had to order and pay for a napkin- that they only had wet wipes for 99c. ....?????? Ummm okkkkkkaaay. I then asked for water and she said I also needed to order that in the app. I said there was only bottled water and I wanted a glass of water and pointed to another table to show her. She said no and said she can add it to my order. Not wanting to argue and being thirsty, I agreed. But hmmmm. I will say everything arrived promptly and she wasn't rude so this was confusing. - Service -?  Ambiance- I call it industrial efficiency. Not as nice as din tai fan - 2.5 stars  Food- it is actually delicious. Being from the bay I have had my share of dim sum and this is mwah. Esp the shrimp roll. I wish I was there with a group so I could eat more. - 4 stars  Overall - 4 stars but bring a napkin and ask for water in advance"
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,7-Jun-24,i like this recipe but i eating this food i will show you and you order it it's very good... for your health https://buyozempiconlinemexico.org/product/ozempic-semaglutide/
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,27-Feb-23,"I definately recommend the bbq pork buns! It's not like the traditional baked pork buns at like Din Tai Fung or some normal asian spot. Their breadding is a bit different but its flakey and super light. Their service was quick and really helpful and nice. We had some issues with our order and the workers fixed it right away. Out of my whole trip definately one of the places I definately recommend when visiting Singapore! I will come back when I come back for another trip! Their food is filling, yummy, and it may seem small through photos but it was a lot of food! I didnt take more photos of the food that was served after these came onto the table but everything else was great!"
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,14-Jan-20,"Very good and affordable dim sum place. If you come during tea time, between lunch and dinner, you get a wide selection of dishes for $3.8 which is a steal!  The chashabao is crafted beautifully, crunchy, sweet and also savory. Gotta love the combination of textured and flavors. The shaomai and other dumplings don't skimp out on meat and shrimp, and the flavor is very consistent throughout the dishes.  Only downside is no outside drinks, and that service can be a little rough at times. Also charging for hand towels seems a little too old fashioned and annoying."
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,3-Jul-22,"I heard THW was a Michelin star restaurant so I wanted to check it out. I was not disappointed. It's a solid dim sum place and everything was super fresh. My favorite was the baked bbq buns.  The service wasn't anything fancy... to the point, just how I like my service at dim sum places. I missed my opportunity to go to THW in Hawaii, so I'm glad I was able to go to one of the locations in Singapore."
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,29-Dec-18,"I went to Tim Ho Wan for dim sum lunch. I ordered a bunch of dishes so here are some highlights: The prawn dumplings were pretty good, the pork siewmai was very tasty, the steamed egg cake is a nice light and fluffy consistency, the pork rice rolls were fine, the Hong Kong style egg tarts were some of the best I've had, and the mango sago was refreshing.  The service speed is fast. The prices are okay for this type of dim sum food. There is a decent amount of seating, though not as much as in most dim sum places.  Overall, Tim Ho Wan has solid Cantonese dim sum food. I initially came here because I read that it got a Michelin star, but after eating there, I didn't feel like it was really that exceptional. Still, if you are interested in tasty dim sum, Tim Ho Wan is a very good choice."
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,14-Jan-18,"In 2011 summer, I lined up like everyone else did in front of the original Tim Ho Wan in Hong Kong, it got a Michelin Star that year, dubbed as the cheapest Michelin, in fact.  I took the opportunity to try it one last time in 2012 but ultimately it became an impossible task as the fan base was growing. So it expanded. I heard the New York outpost is lackluster.  But I don't get to come to Singapore often enough and it's right inside the hotel, so it felt appropriate to try. It was a hot and humid 82 degree weather and I didn't want to go outdoors.  Turns out the place was half empty. I got a nice seat and ordered what was popular. the BBQ pork buns, the chicken feet, the ribs, etc. Try to stay carb free by eating the fillings only.  The verdict is that it's good, but not as good as circa 2011 in Hong Kong after its receipt of the Michelin. Still, I like my nostalgia and familiarity.  A good find."
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,28-Jun-18,One Michelin Star for an inexpensive dim sum restaurant? Alright. This one was located just off the City Hall MRT station in Singapore and seemed to have the best rating and review on yelp.  I ordered a bunch of dishes with my niece and her friends and here it goes. The bbq pork bun was baked not steamed but it was very good. The bread layer was pretty thin and there was a substantial amount of bbq pork filling. There was an air gap but it all just seemed to be in the right proportions. The har gau or shrimp dumpling was also very good. They had a small wonton noodle dish that was also good and they had these green skinned wonton like it was made from spinach. In fact most of it compared very well with some of the best dim sum I have ever had. Maybe not a Michelin star but close. Prices compared with those in California so no complaints.  I will be back again to try some of the other dishes. Go try it!
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,4-Jun-19,"My first time trying Tim Ho Wan was in Sydney three years ago and I fell in love instantaneously. Being from the USA, I was super excited to see so many THW locations in Singapore. This one in CityLink is the closest to Marina Bay Sands, where we were staying.  No wait for lunch, surprisingly, and our meal did not disappoint. Everything is so tasty but my two favorite things are the Baked BBQ Pork Bun and Steamed Egg Cake. So good that we ordered a second round for both! The only thing that I'd skip next time would be the egg tarts; I've definitely had better elsewhere.  Pricey for dim sum, but completely worth it (at least once), in my opinion."
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",3,27-Feb-23,Slightly overrated and definitely over priced. Food was above average but the portions were small. We were there during Chinese New Year and had some of the special menu-everything was good but not great. Also bring your own napkins. You only got one per person otherwise you have to pay for extras.
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,28-Oct-17,Impressive line up of savory dim sum.Place is really good for a dim sum experience. Its one of the good dim sum places Ive ever been.
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,14-Jan-19,"So I passed this place due to the iPhone not giving good directions. Once I finally made all I can say was yummy......  I wondered the shrimp dumplings, spinach and shrimp dumplings, chicken spring rolls which are fried, the fried milk custard and also the braised beef noodle soup.   Everything was delicious. I should have ordered more. The only thing that I did not care for was the braised beef noodle soup. It wasn't what I expect has far as flavor. Even when adding sauces to it, it just wasn't tasty at all. One Michelin Star of yummy greatness! Check it out"
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",3,7-Apr-18,"Suprised to see this michelin star dim sum at underground mrt walkway in singapore - realized they have many locations. Their turnip cake was a serious disappointment- it was pure white radish , not hot and no toppings inside. The famous bbq bun was good - but a little too sweet & salty - good amount of filling."

The baked BBQ pork buns in particular were very popular (I thought they were good but not as much as some of the others at my table did). Try coming later in the day to avoid long lines. Look forward to trying the original(s) in Hong Kong that actually garnered the perhaps politicized M*(s).
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,6-Jun-20,Ordered delivery from here during the lockdown. We got a variety of dimsums and they were all well packed and traveled well. Enjoyed the pork and shrimp dumplings the most. Prices are reasonable as well.
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,18-May-19,"We had a light lunch today. The fried rice, veggie dumplings, and shumai were good beyond our expectation.

Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,5-May-16,"Cha Siew Bao must try.  The Cha Siew Bao is so good that my gf get a nose bleed when she eats it. So get those tissues ready.  The pork liver vermicelli roll is pretty good, but personally I think something is missing in there. The next best favourite would be the chicken feet! Tender and fat, well marinated and tasty down to the bones.  We had the chew siew noodles and the glutinous rice, both fills the tummy with its sizeable portion.  The tonic medlar jelly dessert with wolfberries is a delight.  $40 for two pax. Reasonable."
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,3-Dec-15,"Well I loveeeeeee eating at Tim Ho Wan only if there's no queue!  This is the 6th outlet in Singapore and I chanced upon it while on my way to another restaurant (which I gave up!). No queue during weekend dinner hour (YAY)!  Surprised to see new additions on the menu at this outlet that is pretty much adjusted to fit local taste buds. Laksa wanton and chilli crab taro dumpling.  We ordered 2/4 of their ËÄ´óÌìÍõ (Big 4 Heavenly Kings) Baked BBQ pork bun and pork liver vermicelli roll, pork congee and century egg & salted egg, beancurd skin with shrimp and chilli crab taro dumpling. We enjoyed every dish we ordered, except for the beancurd skin with shrimp. We really enjoy pork liver cooked just right, something that is really hard to find in Singapore, consistency of those baked bbq pork bun which they maintained for all their franchise stalls, well balanced pork congee that is not too salty, and that really tasty chilli crab taro dumpling that is fried perfectly with a punch of fire after the chilli crab gets down to my stomach. I felt that there was no need for any sauces throughout the meal.  The beancurd skin with shrimp (the fried dish, not to be confused with the steamed version) was a little disappointing for me though, as it's too oily (not at least served on an oil filter paper), very little shrimp and the texture is rather mushy, and the portion is small. I would have opt for the option of beancurd skin with pork and shrimp instead (the steamed version). Totally not worth $6 for those 3 tiny pieces.  This outlet has password protected wifi, but when I asked the staff, he mentioned that they are not make known the password to the wifi. So dang, no wifi here.  Paid about $32 for this meal to satisfy 2 tummy! It's still worth it for the great quality of the food and services."
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,3-Dec-18,"Really great dim sum place but then again they're famous for that.  The place is rather small since it's located inside a mall, but the service is fast and so is table turnover. We were lucky that we got a seat right away during a lunch rush hour.  Everything on the table was delicious and satisfying. Great price and great dim sum."
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,8-Jun-18,"This is one of the better location of Tim Ho Wan, comparing to the ones in the States and Vietnam. The prices do not differ much at each place, remaining quite reasonable and even low for such quality of food and service. 3 years ago I got driven here by a taxi driver after asking for a good place for dim sum in Singapore and was told it won a Michelin star. I was not disappointed at all. The dishes were of good taste and high quality. Besides the basic dishes like har gow of shu mai, their specialities are excellent. My must order dish for every visit is the one (I don't remember the name) topped with wasabi sauce and roe. Sometimes they have seasonals, and during winter time they made a delicious mini har gow dish made to be eaten with Sichuan peppercorns sauce. For such a famous and busy place, food got served surprisingly quickly and still piping hot. I definitely recommend everyone to check it out if you're a big fan of dim sum."
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,22-Jul-17,"This is just a review for their pick up counter. But yes. It's awesome. So. Good.  Ordered the following:  BBQ pork buns (3 buns, $5.60 SGD) Pan fried carrot(radish) cake (3 pieces, $5.30) Beancurd Skin w/Shrimp (3 rolls, $6.40) Hong Kong style egg tart (Buy 3 get one free, $4.80)  I was walking through Raffles place, and just sat down on a bench and started eating, because they do recommend that you eat the BBQ buns within an hour. Boy am I glad I started eating early. What is so outstanding about this dim sum is that the main ingredients really shine through in terms of flavor. As amazing as the crust is for the BBQ buns, the pork is actually the star. The radish flavor of the cakes were so noticeable (in a good way) that it make you feel like their radishes were fresh! The beancurd skin was crispy, and had a balanced amount of filling- not too little nor too much.  Just right. That's when you know you've got good dim sum. Everything tastes just right. No heavy feeling after eating it (I basically ate all of that in an afternoon and felt fine)."
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,2-Jun-18,"Ever since Tim Ho Wan has opened in NYC, I have always wanted to go - but knew that there were always long lines. So ironically enough, I end up in Singapore and realize that many of the globally-recognized dim sum spots that are delicious (Tim Ho Wan, too many Din Tai Fungs to count) appear to be here - and this one being in the mall right next to the hotel we are staying! It doesn't get any better than rolling out for breakfast right when Tim Ho Wan opens at 10:30 AM, and there is no line or wait to speak of! We got seated quickly, our food came out quickly, and while the service wasn't personable, you aren't coming here because you expect to be treated like a king.  I finally got to see what all the hype was about, especially the pork buns....holy cow is all I can say. I've had some good pork buns, and there's a really good cheap spot in NYC Chinatown that I love, but the buns here are by far the best I've had. The roll is a little sweet but not that thick at all, and the pork inside is deliciously savory. If I had more time in Singapore (and more stomach space), I would probably grab an order of these to go every day. The rest of the dim sum was pretty good as well; I particularly liked the pork ribs served in black bean sauce, as the sauce was a much lighter version (I was expecting the ribs to be drenched in a heavy marinade) and made each bite less heavy, but just as flavorful. The bean curd skin was juicy and moist, and the shumai was fresher and less dry than most other versions I have encountered elsewhere, although the flavor was not necessarily any more distinctive.  In all, I get the hype when it comes to the buns. The rest of the food is quite good as well. It's basically a more premium, better-prepared version of dim sum, but if you can get in, I understand why folks really love the food here and are willing to wait for it. The takeout line here is a plus for sure, in the event that you are on the go."
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,30-Mar-16,"This was my first visit to Tim Ho Wan, and I can say holy moley this place is as good as people say!  The people next to me were kind enough to see my total confusion on what to order, and pointed me to a few signatures... and they were spot on. The BBQ pork buns, the vermicelli with liver, and the gloutinous rice - all fantastic. And how cheap is this place!? I left paying only $20 including a drink, and paid with my Amex!  One has just opened up here in Melbourne. I'm going tomorrow! Just pure awesome. Check them out."
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",2,25-Nov-18,"The dim sum is good, but the location is stark and the service is really poor. It reminds me of a dirty middle school cafeteria: think mash potatoes 'slop and plop' by the old woman with the hairnet - all that's missing is the cigarette hanging from her mouth. Yet another example of what Singapore is willing to tolerate for restaurant settings."
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,11-Dec-15,"Known for it's world renowned ""baked buns with bbq pork"" and the ""steamed egg cake"" ,this dim sun restaurant boast a menu with an exciting array of dishes like the ""pork & shrimp siew Mai"", ""prawn dumplings "", glutinous rice with lotus leaf"" etc. The menu now also includes new dishes suited to our local taste buds like the ""chilli crab taro dumplings "" and the ""laksa wonton "". Overall, all the dishes served here are well prepared by experience dim sum chefs and is of very high quality! Tried their ""baked buns with BBQ pork"" and all I can say was it was excellent! The bun was soft and flavorful and the pork was very tasty! Baked buns with BBQ pork - 9/10"
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,24-Jan-18,Great Dim Sum - fast efficient service. The pork buns were probably the best I've had. Has a fast food feel to it but very attentive wait staff.
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",3,28-Jan-18,Only giving this place a 3 Star and not 4 because it's not traditional dim sum I'm use to. They hand you a sheet and you order from it. The dim sum was okay. Not the best I've had nor the worst. It was nice for a quick snack in between meals.
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",3,18-Feb-18,"Below my expectation, the publicity and popularity created high expectation and affects my review, I would say the food is okay."
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,23-Jun-17,The dim sum was pretty tasty and perfectly cooked except for the Ya chow fried rice which was bland.
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",4,29-Jul-17,Tim Ho wan has great food. The shuo mai is so flavorful and delicious! The pi guat is my favorite! It's so flavorful and i like the sauce that comes with it to! The service is good but the restaurant is very busy. If you go to Tim Ho Wan be prepared to wait in line. But overall i would highly recommend Tim Ho Wan to anybody that likes dim sum
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,28-Jan-16,"Finally got to dine in at Tim Ho Wan. Ordered the Baked Bun with BBQ Pork, Pan Fried Carrot Cake, Pork Dumpling with Shrimp, Prawn Dumpling and Osmanthus Cake. Loving the Baked Bun with BBQ Pork and the Osmanthus Cake. The food are all delicious but I feel that this two are the best. The Baked Bun with BBQ Pork is a must try. One of the famous item here. Interested in Osmanthus Cake because of those drama that I watched in younger days. This jelly is really sweet and nice. Their service are good too. The water will be refill whenever you wanted. Will be back to try for more!"
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,24-Sep-16,Can never go wrong with the bbq baked buns and the glutenous rice in lotus leaves . They are the only 2 items on the menu I stop in to do a take away .
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,1-Nov-16,Some of the best dim.sum I've ever had! I'm still dreaming about the bbq pork buns...
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,13-Mar-18,"I mean, it's perfect. Great steamed pork buns."
Tim Ho Wan,4.3,36,"Dim Sum, Cantonese",5,1-Jan-17,Same great food without the wait. I was pleasantly surprised. The BBQ pork buns are the bomb! I chowed down 3 of them in a single breath!
Super Loco Customs House,3.4,8,"Cocktail Bars, Mexican",3,11-Nov-20,Mexican food is just so pricey and average in Singapore that I've a hard time enjoying it. I find it hard to pay ten bucks for a very average taco when it's ten times cheaper and ten times better in the US. That being said this is one of the better places in Singapore if you do have a Mexican food craving. Their lunch combo though expensive is good value for money by Singapore standards. 30$ pp gets you an appetizer a main course and an option between dessert and coffee.
Super Loco Customs House,3.4,8,"Cocktail Bars, Mexican",5,14-Nov-16,"When I moved to Singapore I started what sometimes felt like an everlasting search for good Mexican. I have a favorite place to get my Mexican fix but they serve mainly traditional Mexican food which is awesome but sometimes you want that little extra. Super Loco Customs House managed to satisfy that itch I had with their cool, modern & relaxed Mexican.  Reading their menu filled my heart with joy and excitement and I was even happier when I took my first bite of the Lobster tostadas. Finally a place which understands what I mean by Mexican food!  As the evening progressed, my friend and I had a selection of other dishes and all of them were very very good. I also tried two different cocktails who were good as well: yay for a margarita which is not pure sugar syrup!  I find it not cheap when comparing to Mexican food in the US but for Singapore standards I find it reasonable for what you get, especially considering the location.  ME LIKEY!!"
Super Loco Customs House,3.4,8,"Cocktail Bars, Mexican",2,14-Jan-17,"Overall, don't go for the food, which is average, and pretty expensive. Go only if you want to be by the bay. And I don't even say if you want a nice fancy Mexican dinner, because the music was too loud both from the restaurant itself and the Esplanade concert hall on the other end of the bay (we could feel the bass from where we were). For actually good Mexican with a much nicer ambience (although not by a water body), I recommend El Mero Mero at CHIJMES, with the Entertainer app if you have it. For much better Mexican food in a cute small family-owned place at much better prices (but not easily accessible), go to Belmonte Latin Foods, which is 1/3 the price and has much better food. For a hip and more accessible (financially and transportationally) place head to Muchachos.   De Pescado Fish taco ($11) - 1.5 stars This wasn't even average. It was downright bad. The fish was dry and overcooked. And I've had real fish tacos in Mexico and Southern California so I know they're not meant to be like this!  De Camarones Prawn taco ($13) - 2.5 stars The prawns weren't fishy thankfully, but they also lacked any distinct flavour. A very unmemorable dish.  Costilla De Res Beef quesadilla ($18) - 3 stars This was the best of the lot, thanks to the flavour, but the texture of the beef was dry and overcooked. My dad would hate it.  Not to mention, all the portions were terribly small. The prices for the tacos are per taco. We were still hungry by the end, but the food disappointed and we figured we'd rather head elsewhere.   Ambience - 2 stars This is what we were most disappointed by, given that I figured half of what I'm paying for is going towards their rental cost. Our outdoor table for two was seated such that my plus one had no view of the bay, just of the inside of the restaurant. We improvised and shifted the chair over at the end of the meal so that we both faced the water, a la a Parisian cafe.  There were loudspeakers overhead that were blaring music, and on a Friday night there must have been a concert (sounded more like a horror show somehow) at the outdoor amphitheater at the Esplanade. As mentioned, we could actually feel the bass coming from over there! My plus one did not enjoy it at all and we agreed we probably wouldn't come back, mostly because of the poor ambience."

Super Loco Customs House,3.4,8,"Cocktail Bars, Mexican",3,29-Jul-18,I love this place simply for their atmosphere and drinks. Having that beautiful view of marina bay with a margarita in your hand right in front of you for dinner is really something. Their calamansi margarita is one of my favourites too.  Although their food itself is nothing amazing. It's probably on the better side for the mexican food you find in Singapore be it's still not authentic or flavourful enough for me to want to come back -- especially as a vegetarian. Their enchiladas are decent but aren't as addictive as I would've liked but their quesadilla is good.
Super Loco Customs House,3.4,8,"Cocktail Bars, Mexican",1,21-Jul-21,"I had reserved a Bayfront high table but looked like they never paid attention to the booking and lead us indoor, seated us at the Bayfront table only after telling them and they crossed checked against our booking. The waiter was cheerful in giving us suggestions and 2/3 appetisers came as soon as he finished entering our options in his tab. Then we had to wait 30+ mins for our third appetiser. We were hungry and not happy about the wait. The dish was delayed even after reminding them. The food lacked a lot in flavour. We were celebrating a birthday and decided to cancel the preordered cake due to the unpleasant wait and flavour less food. Was not ready to pay $14 for a small lava cake after this experience. After the main course we again had to wait 30+ mins just to get our check. The person who was attending our table refused to address our multiple calls. Then we waited again to get someone to take the payment and to get it back. The long unnecessary waits made the experience very unpleasant."
Super Loco Customs House,3.4,8,"Cocktail Bars, Mexican",5,26-Jan-17,"Love this place. Food is very good, tasty and portions are decent. The drinks menu is fantastic, and they make a delicious Sparkling Sangria using a lovely Spanish cava called Delapierre. Its always a great night out at Super Loco. They view is top-notch, and it doesn't get too hot out on the terrace. Im usually there every one or two weeks."
Super Loco Customs House,3.4,8,"Cocktail Bars, Mexican",5,13-Oct-16,"Coming from Texas, and being Mexican, my standards of Mexican food are pretty darn high. It's one of the main things I miss about living in Texas, so when I discovered Super Loco it definitely was a happy day. I have been once just for drinks, and it's a great location right by the Fullerton hotel right on the Bay overlooking the water. Great place to sit outside for margaritas or a date. I also recently had a office lunch here which was really good! I opted for the soft shell crab taco and creamed corn, both were excellent! I tried some of the others salsas, and the chocolate dessert. Every single thing was VERY good! The margaritas were tasty, and the ambience was solid! Not sure if they have a happy hour, prices are typical for SG, and unfortunately this location does not offer brunch. I've heard the Robertson Quay location's brunch is amazing. Definately a nice addition to Marina Bay!"
The Quarters,5,1,"Cafes, Asian Fusion, Desserts",5,10-Jul-15,"This is an amazing spot. If you're visiting Singapore, make a trip here-- no matter what part of the city you're staying in.

Try: chili crab pasta, rice pattie chicken satay burger, durian cheesecake (!!!) and much, much more. Mmmmmm."

Highly recommend the oyster omelette, chili crab dip and bread, prawn fried dumplings, paper chicken, minced meat with fish on rice, and prawn paste chicken. I think this place is open 24 hours too!"
Íú½ÇücÐÄ Mongkok Dim Sum,,,,1,27-Feb-22,"This was not good at all. I didn't have high hopes going in but it turned out to be worse than I had expected. We ordered a few things to share (har gao, lotus paste buns, steamed rice rolls, beancurd roll with pork and shrimp and spinach dumplings) and they were all underwhelming. Everything seemed to have been reheated as they all fell apart when we tried to pick it up. Flavor was bland and it was hard to finish the small amount of food we had gotten. Do not recommend."
Íú½ÇücÐÄ Mongkok Dim Sum,,,,4,26-Dec-12,"Original-destination: UYE#2 @ Immigrants Bar, Joo Chiat Random-pit-stop: Mongkok Dim Sum  Stefan L. and I were making our way to the second UYE at Immigrant's Bar when hunger climbed into the control mechanisms within our brains and piloted us off the bus just two short stops after we got on from the Kallang MRT Station. I'm honest when I say that I have no bloody clue where I am BUT I trusted Stefan both as a friend and guide as well as his opinion on Singaporean delicacies. So I tagged on quietly, albeit excitedly...for what we will be having at this pit-stop.  As we zipped through several streets on foot (thankfully without bumping into random sleazebags that this area is apparently known for), he just mentioned that this ""beef hor fun"" was to die for and their dim-sum was like no other in Singapore. I wanted to troll him right that moment but decided to pass up on the ""oh, you would totally die for some beef *whore* fun huh?"" (Glad I bit my lip...cause we passed by a couple of such late night creatures on the way there).  Right...so we arrived and noted that other reviews had been of the ""beef kway teow"" spot right across the street. Apparently, a little history lesson from Stefan, the uncle who owns Mongkok fell out with his nephew who then established that spot and both pointing fingers at each other that each had stolen each others' recipe.  Honestly, I don't give two twats about that rivalry. Whoever makes the better dish wins. Since Stefan said that this place has the better ""hor fun""...well, that nephew can go eat some balls.  Our dish came out shortly after we placed our order.  Beef Hor Fun:  1 - there is a lot of beef...TENDER BEEF (reminds me of the ""Mongolian Beef"" dishes in US Chinese Restaurants; meat beaten the crap out off until tender) 2 - the ratio of beef to noodles was...practically 1 to 1...which is freaking AWESOME 3 - I didn't know it was SPICY (well for me it is)...and for all of you who don't know, my body has never recovered from my chili eating contest eons ago...so I had to really, really, REALLY take my time eating it 4 - WIN  Dim Sum:  1. nothing spectacular tbh, but I'd eat it again any given day. 2. so if this is the ""best"" in Singapore, dang...we have a problem."
Íú½ÇücÐÄ Mongkok Dim Sum,,,,2,27-Oct-15,"Would be the first and the last time if me going there. Yes, it was great that I get to eat Dim Sum at 5am when I was really craving for it, but to get all the way there, and being served with barely-considered-warm porridge, slightly below average dim sum, was seriously a damper.  Part of me wish that I have gone for mamak instead...  But good thing - at least it's open, 24 hours if you really need your dim sum fix. But ya, depends on how desperate you are ... Otherwise just wait a bit and there should be plenary open by 8am.... And my fav opens at 11am :)"
Íú½ÇücÐÄ Mongkok Dim Sum,,,,4,21-Oct-14,"This is one of those, ""Thanks Yelp for helping me find this!"" kind of place.  I agree with my husband's initial assessment, which is ""This place is dim sum without all the frills."" It's a corner shop, not air conditioned, no ambiance... strictly food. When we arrived around 11 AM, it was almost packed!  Taking this as a good sign, we were seated right away and given a one page, double sided menu along with an order form. Now this is the part where you'll slap me in the face- I actually didn't order dim sum this time around because I was feeling under the weather (stomach-wise.) I only ordered chicken porridge while my husband ordered all of his favourite dishes.  Although they don't focus on porridge, I was happy with the result even though it took a while for it to be served. It came with an egg yolk, which gave it more flavour in addition to the pepper. It was pure comfort food and hit the spot! Husband was happy with his dim sum.  Overall, great spot for morning dim sum; wouldn't hesitate to come back when my stomach decides to cooperate! Also love how it's easily accessible by public transportation, as the closest bus stop caters to 11 bus lines."
Íú½ÇücÐÄ Mongkok Dim Sum,,,,5,25-Jun-14,"I've been here almost 3 times in the past 2 to 3 months, and whilst I've seen reviews saying that this place isn't as great as it is made out to be, I beg to differ. I am of Indian origin, and maybe my discernment for truly fantastic dim sum is a lot more skewed than the norm, but I find the dim sum here to be very satisfying. That being said, I am sure there are some other pretty amazing dim sum places across our city, I've just not been to them yet probably.  There are certain food items I tend to stay away from like glutinous rice and chicken feet, or stew of any kind, but I love the other dim sum on offer here. They boast an amazing variety that is impressive for a local hawker-styled establishment in Geylang. Whilst I am sure this is not the only dim sum place in that vicinity, it's the only one there that I've been to and unless I am introduced to another, I will keep going back.  Their regular items like har gao, siew mai, chee cheong fun with minced pork, yam puff, fried prawn dumpling, prawn paste chicken, fried beancurd skin with shrimp, char siew baos, amongst a few others, are all really well prepared in my opinion. The food here is value for money, we spent about $15-20 excluding drinks per person here with a tonne of food to share between us, and the real draw of this little dim sum joint is that it is open 24 hours a day. That's right, 3am dim sum cravings here we come!  Give it a try, its no Michelin restaurant, but it definitely does the job for me!"
Íú½ÇücÐÄ Mongkok Dim Sum,,,,5,7-Jul-18,"What a hidden gem - all of Singapore's finest flavours available in bite-sized treats!  Don't expect much English spoken or a glamorous venue - this is just good, honest local food.  Think Singapore crab buns, pork belly buns, prawn dumpling (har gow), prawn paste chicken wings, carrot cake just to name a few of the dim-sum based brunch menu.  Food is fast, hot & fresh and accepting credit cards is a bonus.  For drinks try the lime juice (refreshing for the nations' tropical climate) and tri-colour milk tea."
Íú½ÇücÐÄ Mongkok Dim Sum,,,,3,14-Sep-18,"For dim sum experts, this is not the best stall to visit. Most of the dishes are heated up from the fridge.  Foodies used to dum sum restaurants in Hong Kong or Canton will feel the difference.  Honestly not recommended"
Íú½ÇücÐÄ Mongkok Dim Sum,,,,5,18-Jan-15,"Everything was good, and I wish we were feeding a bigger group so we could have tried one of everything. The only awkward part was not getting seated and standing around when we arrived. The food more than made up for it though.  For American stomachs, this spot is very gentle and should be a good meal even for someone who's picky."
Íú½ÇücÐÄ Mongkok Dim Sum,,,,4,5-Mar-14,"Good selection of dishes including entrees, dim sum, desserts, drinks and teas. Efficient service. Always has customers. A bit more costly than other similar places in the area. This one is better though. Also spacious with nice seating and ambience.  Cash only but I find this more common than credit card acceptance in Singapore."
Íú½ÇücÐÄ Mongkok Dim Sum,,,,3,31-May-16,Moderate pricing for a street eatery. Points for being 24/7. Good luck getting seated over the weekends but one of my favorite things is to stroll out for late night nibbles on a weeknight. Nice gritty street vibes and fantastic porridge.
Lau Pa Sat,4.5,12,"Singaporean, Chinese, Indian",5,22-Mar-24,"Dare I say this was better than the fan favorite chili crab?  It was raining on our last full day in Singapore. I heard Satay Street opens at 7 PM, but by 6:45 PM the exit from Lau Pa Sat to Satay Street was lined with a representative of each stall hoping to snatch your business. According to my taxi driver, there is a ""no touting"" policy. However, I felt a little intimidated and was hoping to choose which stall I wanted outside.  I looked specifically for Best Satay stall no. 7 & 8 because the name speaks for itself. It was hard to find which person was representing that stall because the stall no. is on the back of their vests. Luckily after several attempts, I saw stall no. 7 & 8's menu flash in front of me. I quickly accepted and ignored the rest to get out of the chaos.  The rain began to slow and I was able to place my order outside. It was clear to me that no. 7 & 8 had the most business from the outside view. I ordered Set B for S$44 twice! We loved it so much, we got a second round. Set B comes with 15 Chicken, 15 Mutton/Beef, and 10 Prawn skewers. The most tender was the chicken, but the best flavors were the mutton and beef. The skewers come with a thick peanut, soy sauce that was delicious too!  In terms of the crowd, I witnessed a lot more tourists here than other hawkers. Sugarcane Juice was the same price as Maxwell and Chinatown Complex at S$2.5 each, but Lau Pa Sat's came in a smaller cup, tasted less sweet, and wasn't made fresh. Other food stalls are available, but we came for the satay and it exceeded our expectations.  On the ride back to our hotel, our taxi driver mentioned that Newton Food Centre has better satay and the meat is less tough than Satay Street. If I had more days in Singapore, I'd definitely try it to compare."

The building is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week - that's awesome, right?But before you come marching here at 3am expecting a lot of options waiting for you, you might want to go back to bed and come at a later time. Because the lights are on but nobody's here. There will be a handful stalls open.  I came here before sunrise to avoid the heat and the crowd since this is an open building that doesn't have fans or A/C. It was like a ghost town. The tables and chairs are there but no diners. I had the whole place to myself. There were a few stalls open so, I got myself some breakfast: coffee, Kaya toast, and char kway teow. It was more than enough food at 6am.  There are hundreds of stalls and food vendors. Variety is not lacking. They have Singaporean, Chinese, Cantonese, Japanese, Thai, Filipino, Malaysian, Indonesian, Korean, Indian, American, Mexican, and Turkish. You can get nasi goreng, satay, lechon kawali, burger, waffles, ice cream, taco, noodles, rice bowls, bulgogi, laksa, tikka masala, pastry, coffee, fruit juice, etc. It's like traveling the world without having to leave the building. What's even better is that everything is inexpensive.  If you're in Singapore for a few days, visit Lau Pa Sat at different times of the day. Come here for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Try as many stalls and dishes as you possibly can. If you live in Singapore, you're lucky! A huge variety of good food at good prices - you can't beat that!"
Lau Pa Sat,4.5,12,"Singaporean, Chinese, Indian",5,19-Nov-23,"I was expecting this market to be rustic and primitive but it was much more like a food court with individual restaurants with communal tables and chairs. The food variety spanned from typical Asian to Mexican and Turkish. Everything was prepared fresh, and even though it is non air-conditioned, the air flowed well, and it was not a big mix of food smells. The restroom facilities were very modern, and there was no charge to use the bathroom. Toilet paper was supplied in every stall with a communal hand washing area just outside the toilet area. If you are looking for a fresh chili crab, this is the place to find it."
Lau Pa Sat,4.5,12,"Singaporean, Chinese, Indian",4,16-Feb-24,Ate here for a late lunch (not busy at the late lunch) on a weekday and for dinner (busy) on a weekday. We only saw the satay being offered for dinner. It is cooked outside on grills. Portion sizes for the satay are generous. All the food we had was good. The new dish we liked the most was the Ipoh curry chicken. The location was close to our hotel and other attractions so very convenient.
Lau Pa Sat,4.5,12,"Singaporean, Chinese, Indian",5,1-Sep-23,"This hawker center is over 150 years old and is the original hawker center that's been here since Singapore was founded.  This was my first time to a hawker center and I instantly fell in love with it. As you walk into the establishment you are presented with a multitude of food stalls. Each one specializes in a specific cuisine from all over Asia. During my time in Singapore, I went here every day for lunch and dinner.  I can quite honestly say that every dish I had here was delicious. Japanese, Chinese, Malaysian, Indian, Turkish....all thr dishes were amazing. Each one was teaming with flavor and authentic flavors from the region. The best thing about it is that the average dish runs you around $6 which is incredible.  The ambiance of the Hawker Center is awesome. Absolutely packed during dinner time you'll see the tables filled with tourists and locals all enjoying a delicious meal and having a laugh while they converse. If you're visiting singapore for the first time then make sure you put this Hawker Center on your list of places to visit."
Lau Pa Sat,4.5,12,"Singaporean, Chinese, Indian",5,16-Sep-22,"This is an upscale hawkers market located right downtown in the business and banking district. Conveniently a block from the hotel! We rewatched Anthony Bourdain's various trips to Singapore and were not inspired to try some of that way off the reservation fare. And we don't have a car so walking out of the Westin two lefts and a city block wide and deep is this place! Foodie Heaven! That is if you like Chinese Indonesian, Japanese, Indian, Thai and on and on... The queue for satay stand # 7&8 apparently famous was no joke. But we were here for the crab. We could have ventured to a famous table cloth clad fancy pants place with a view of the river, but as our Singaporean/ Pacifica transplant, Cabbie suggested; to go here and you can get a spicy crab AND a pepper crab for the same as one spicy at a restaurant.  Ohh let me tell you! I'd fly 16 hours again to eat those delectable crustaceans! Washed down with a couple of large Tiger beers on tap at another stall next door and you are set! Warning... don't attempt to eat this in white clothes or fancy attire. Even tho they issue you plastic gloves there's no telling where that sauce will fly as you scavenge each tasty bit not wanting to leave anything behind. BBQ seafood I think stall 18. As the line to best satay stall 7&8 wasn't getting any shorter we went ahead and ordered that too. The best I've ever eaten!  Place was packed with folks just ending work, meeting friends hanging! Open til 2 am food Heaven!"
Lau Pa Sat,4.5,12,"Singaporean, Chinese, Indian",4,22-Mar-24,"I love Lau Pa Sat, place very close to Raffles MRT, this place nice for the group ambiance good, foods there are very popular i love the satay, Laksa, Hokkien etc"
Lau Pa Sat,4.5,12,"Singaporean, Chinese, Indian",5,7-Oct-23,"Anything and everything! Get the order in 45 minutes early for dinner sate. It's a big thing here. The street is closed and extra tables are put up around 7pm. Better to be here after the lunch crush. Every table space will be taken! My favorite foods in Singapore are here. Very reasonable prices. Enjoy and be sure to clean up and return your dishes, glassware and tray to the appropriate collection spots!"
Lau Pa Sat,4.5,12,"Singaporean, Chinese, Indian",4,6-May-21,"If there's one thing I know, it's if you go to Singapore, you go to a hawkers market and the best one I went to hands down was Lau Pa Sat. It's in the heart of downtown and offers a ton of variety and walking distance from Marina Bay Sands which I was staying at.  As the market is open 24/7, it's at night when things get cracking. This huge outdoor food court is known for crab and stingray so I had to try them and they were both amazing. It can get busy so make sure you go find a seat first and then go around to the vendors to get your food.  I would definitely come back again when in Singapore."
Lau Pa Sat,4.5,12,"Singaporean, Chinese, Indian",4,21-Jan-23,We were visiting Singapore last week and Lau Pa Sat is within walking distance from Citadines Raffles Place. It has been more than 5 decades that I last had a meal at Lau Pa Sat. This eatery site has flourished from its old layout. Every store looks bright and perky. The food is always good at Lau Pa Sat. Definitely a MUST visit and eat whenever you are visiting Singapore.
Lau Pa Sat,4.5,12,"Singaporean, Chinese, Indian",5,7-Apr-19,"Best food court ever! Over 100 stands of all kinds and origins Food super cheap Any taste you want  Fragrance garden stand was so so Satay stand 3 4 was pretty good, satay stand 7 so so Fruit juice stand is awesome Beef meatball soup stand was very good but I suggest beef slices. Meat balls were ok"
Rempapa,5,3,Singaporean,5,1-Jun-24,Absolutely delicious food! Everything was fresh and extremely tasty! The kueh kuehs were heavenly! Lemongrass drink wqs very refreshing.
Rempapa,5,3,Singaporean,5,26-May-24,"We ordered too much for 6 pax.  The food was very good. You can never go wrong with Chef Damian D'Silva's food. He received the prestigious Artisan & Authenticity Award 2024 from La Liste, a French ranking and restaurants guide which recognises establishments whose creations highlight their region or country's culinary heritage.  My favourite is beef cheek followed by wing bean salad, buah Keluak fried rice, brinjal with that excellent sauce and Kueh pie ti.  The other dishes are also good but I don't care for the kuehs - I find them too sweet.  The otah was not to my liking because I find the taste too strong but my friends liked it."
Rempapa,5,3,Singaporean,5,24-Jan-23,"Rempapa is a chef-driven restaurant offering a refined take on Singaporean food, combining influences from Malay, Indian, and Chinese cuisines. To start, we had the Chickpea Curry with Roti, a bowl of chickpeas in a dark, salty Indian-style curry, served with puffy, crispy triangles of roti on the side. The Sri Lankan Chicken Curry came with a braised chicken drumstick and thigh in a thin gravy, which went nicely with the string hoppers on the side. The Nasi Lemak was a classic dish of coconut jasmine rice served with a roasted chicken leg and thigh covered in a red spice paste, along with a soft-boiled egg, sliced cucumbers, anchovies, and spicy sambal paste. The Market Vegetables (greens stir-fried with garlic) made for a nice side dish, but my favorite was the Baca Assam, a huge hunk of meaty, fatty, tender braised beef cheek in a deliciously spiced sauce. Everything we had here was flavorful and made with quality ingredients, and the diverse menu was a great way to sample the many different influences found in Singaporean cuisine."
The Clueless Goat,3.9,17,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",4,30-Jun-15,"The cappuccino was served just the way I like it! Not only was the latte art adorable, but it also had a nice balanced flavor.  The red velvet cake was a bit disappointing as the cake was rather dry.  Note: there is no wi-fi at this cafe!"
The Clueless Goat,3.9,17,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",3,5-Nov-17,Quite a central location at Novena although slightly off the beaten track as it's at Goldhill Plaza rather than within the malls. Relaxed ambience with good value for money breakfast and sandwiches. I had the lychee mint tee because it was a hot day-that was a disappointing small glass which barely quenched my thirst. Maybe I should have ordered coffee.
The Clueless Goat,3.9,17,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",4,27-Mar-17,Small and cozy cafe. I like the interesting name and location off the beaten track. I had scrambled eggs with bacon and toast. The taste and portion were just right. My friend also enjoyed the waffle and coffee. Service staff were courteous. Met all the ticks of an enjoyable cafe without any major fault!
The Clueless Goat,3.9,17,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",5,24-Jun-18,One word "Yum". Greeted with warm welcome smiles and Good mornings. Very attractive and service is fast. I ordered the waffles and opp out on the bacon (no please) with scramble eggs and a ice chai tea . EVERYTHING was amazing 5's for sure. Great American breakfast away from home
The Clueless Goat,3.9,17,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",4,30-Jul-15,"A delightful spot for coffee and/or bite to eat. Although the table we sat in was quite deep so chatting during busy times can be a little difficult. Excellent sandwich choices and All-Day-Brunch is always nice in my book! Missed it initially on the menu but eyed the Truffle Tater Tots on they way out. Will have to come back and try some, and also check out their specialty coffee drinks. Right outside the Novena MRT station exit (United Square exit)."
The Clueless Goat,3.9,17,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",4,10-May-15,"This cafe is new to the area. Makes a tasty flat white (5 Oz white coffee) and you are sure to find something tasty from the brunch selection. The decor is funky, with book shelves made out of packing crates, and artwork for sale on the walls. Help yourself to fresh chilled water.  My avocado BLT plus flat white cost around $14. The brunch menu includes typical staples like eggs benny, full English, waffles, and there is a cabinet full of delicious looking cakes for those with a sweet tooth.  By noon on Sunday there was a short queue waiting for tables - but if you get there around 11am you should be able to walk straight in."
The Clueless Goat,3.9,17,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",3,14-Jul-18,Atmosphere is bright and inviting. Service was polite but seemed very new to the game. Very clean and so good to have a place with an included toilet facility so we don't need to walk outside or around. Food and coffee was okay. The berry bliss was nice. Would reorder that again when looking for something refreshing and light. It was served in a coconut shell which was different and the ice was very well blended so must be a good gadget making it so smooth. Coffee was satisfactory. Glad we tried it but next time I'd be eager to see what else is down the road.
The Clueless Goat,3.9,17,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",3,30-Jun-16,"A little breakfast and brunch cafe in Novena. The interior seems to be aiming for a cozy modern cottage vibe, though it doesn't quite hit the mark. I ordered the poached eggs on toast, which was two eggs on one super thick slice of white toast, which was kind of strange. It came with a side salad. Unfortunately it's cash only."
The Clueless Goat,3.9,17,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",4,10-Jan-18,"Very cute and clean coffee shop. Their menu has many breakfast/brunch options and their staff was accommodating. I wanted a vanilla latte, but it was not on the menu and the barista made me one anyways and it was delicious! I had the ranchers' toast and it was filling and yummy. I definitely recommend this place for a quick, good, western breakfast or coffee."
The Clueless Goat,3.9,17,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",5,8-Jul-17,Amazing ambiance and outstanding service. The food was great for a morning bunch and really nice with their Flat White. Will definitely be coming back to try the other items on their menu!
The Clueless Goat,3.9,17,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",4,3-Oct-17,Friendly service and value for money! Food was served promptly and it tasted as great as it looked! There was a variety of food to choose from and the staff are very helpful in recommending what is the most sought after option! Definitely will come back to try the rest on the menu!
The Clueless Goat,3.9,17,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",4,24-Jan-16,Great brunch place with good breakfast and brunch food and amazing coffee. I came on a Sunday afternoon and it was filled with young couples with loud babies. But maybe it's less noisy during the week. Overall good Panko chicken sandwich and iced latte.
The Clueless Goat,3.9,17,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",3,8-Mar-16,"A nice lovely space in a great location of novena area. A communal table plus a few tables of 4.  The menu is tight and most impressively, reasonably priced for a change. The staff brings you a menu but you would have to make your way to the counter to place your order.  We got the iced latte which they call ""ice white"" $5.50, a iced chocolate $5.50 and a iced lychee mint tea $6.50. The coffee was strong but I felt lacked depth. The other non coffee drinks were lovely though.  My friend got a brunch plate of avocado toast topped with 2 poached eggs. Competently done for only $8.50! Where to find?  OOT but I love their crockery! It's so organic looking :)   Note: cash only; no GST.  Will be back!"
The Clueless Goat,3.9,17,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",5,16-Oct-16,Good food and pricing is great as its lower than usual brunch places in Singapore. The bacon is delicious! Don't forget to get a coffee stamp card.
The Clueless Goat,3.9,17,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",5,6-Apr-17,I gave an extra star for great value and delicious coffee. Getting a great Aussie style breakfast for under $10 a head is brilliant. We arrived just before 9 and there was already a queue! We liked it so much we went back on Monday but they were closed for lunch. No wifi but get over it!
The Clueless Goat,3.9,17,"Coffee & Tea, Breakfast & Brunch",1,28-Jun-17,"Naming your cafe unconventionally and calling your menu items odd names will never make you a singular success if you continue to have nasty wait staff who frown on big crowds.  We booked a table a day before for breakfast and even warned that we were to have 15 chatty ladies. They took our booking.  This morning , we were greeted with less than perfunctory courtesy and were threatened by a surly counter staff that he would throw us out if we continued to have our laughter and chatter audible. We were told to talk ""quietly""  We apologised and continued our mumsies chats and lo and behold! Mr Sulky Surly came again and s threatened to throw us out for laughing too loud.  It was truly an experience that we were not expecting based on the reviews and to call it unpleasant was an understatement.  What was intolerable was he would go out and chain smoke after making every two cuppa and come in reeking of cigarettes. Ugh!  The British my foot platter and the toter whatchamacallit do not deserve any mention.  My fren asked for more water for her tea jug and she was made to justify why she needed water. I quickly jumped in and offer the equally surly waitress the excuse that my fren couldnt take thick tea to water down any potential unpleasant confrontation.  So sorry to interrupt your otherwise quiet lull morning, Silly Goat! Go back to sleep. We wont come and disturb anymore."
Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",4,2-Apr-24,"Known for Bak Kut Teh (Pork Rib Soup) and recognized by Michelin Guide as a Bib Gourmand. Conveniently located across my hotel, so of course I had to make a stop here.  The food is ordered via QR code and ordered online. The food came out super quick once the order is placed. You pay after you finish dining, which was probably the lengthiest part.  The Premium Loin Rib Soup (SG$9.80) was as good a advertised. Super peppery just like how my parents would make it a home from time to time. They do provide free refills on the broth if you really love it.  We also got the Claypot Pork Tenderloin (SG$8.90) which was also good. Got a cup of Plain Rice (SG$1.40) to go along with it. Definitely pour some of that sauce over the rice for flavoring.  We also got Dou Miao (SG$7.80) for our veggie dish because our foodie trip here in Singapore as been super heaty if you know what I mean.

When I sat down, I didn't have to tell them what order was mine, it just seamlessly was delivered to my table. Same with the check.  I had the rib soup, fritters, and a yuzu drink. I enjoyed all of it. The soy sauce was thicker and sweeter than I'm used to, so a perfect accompaniment to the boiled pork. The broth was very strong back pepper and very tasty, they kept refilling it from a hot teapot, so my bowl never got empty and never got cold. The fritters were good, but served cold. The yuzu drink was icy, but not as strongly citrus taste as I expected."

It sounds so simple...  Dude. Just give me that broth with rice! Can I also say that I LOVE that they top you off on broth continuously too?! For the spareribs, they were, as advertised, super tender. I also dipped it in a little mix of dark soy and chili pepper sauce for added excitement.  I also added a small plate of chicken feet and soy bean curd with my order of the bak kut teh and rice and it was also very good! The chicken feet were BIG but fried and braised very nicely. The bean curd sheets were silky and I liked the soy marinade on it.  All in all, super tasty meal. Definitely a little more expensive than a hawker stall at SGD 16.99 total (Weird price! Wasn't used to something not ending in a multiple of 10). Not going to lie, I walked right over to FairPrice to pick up some of their spice sachets for home!"

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,28-Dec-23,"This place has been Michelin guide rated for the past few years. In the Chinatown Point shopping center, there are several different food options.  When my wife and I walked by there, there was a lenghthy line and there was a staff person at the end suggesting the wait would be 30 minutes. We decided to wait, but we were lucky because several groups finished their meals and left which made the line move a lot quicker, so we probably waited closer to 10 minutes.  Because we ate so much on the Singapore trip, we didn't order too much. We shared one soup with braised pork ribs with a bowl of rice and a kai lan (chinese brocoli side). We ordered from our phones using a qr code.  The herbal soup was flavorful and the pork rib meat was soft, almost falling off the bone. As we were eating, a staffperson came by with a kettle and gave us more soup.  We enjoyed our experience here."

Because we ate so much on the Singapore trip, we didn't order too much. We shared one soup with braised pork ribs with a bowl of rice and a kai lan (chinese brocoli side). We ordered from our phones using a qr code.  The herbal soup was flavorful and the pork rib meat was soft, almost falling off the bone. As we were eating, a staffperson came by with a kettle and gave us more soup.  We enjoyed our experience here."

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,3-Dec-23,"The pork rib soup here is everything! When we arrived for dinner, there was a bit of a wait but eventually got seated after about 15 minutes. Once seated, you order your items through the QR menu which is quick and easy. We ordered the Pork Rib Soup (SG$10.60), Pig's Stomach Soup (SG$8.10), Braised Pig's Trotter (SG$8.50), medium Cai Xin (SG$4.80), and Spicy Pork Belly (SG$8.60). Seriously loved every dish as the veggies were a good balance although small portions. The braised pig and pork belly were so tender and flavorful. That sauce was perfect over some rice. I mean, anything braised just falls off the bone here. The pork rib and intestine soup uses the same broth, so it's just the meat that's different. You must get the soup here as it's so heartwarming and soothing. There's lots of pepper in it, so you also get that kick of spice. The best part is that the soup has unlimited refills! We probably had 5 refills on the soup alone and I wish I could've had more. You get your value from the soup alone already. Such a surpringly delicious meal --yum!"

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,30-Apr-19,"One of my favorite meals in Singapore. Out in LA, even though we have all types of food available. It is always hard to find a place that serves BKT (Èâ¹Ç²è) and of its on the menu it's not as good as this place.  Such a simple dish of broth and pork ribs with rice. Also had the pork kidney and stomach soup as well. Both just as good. Broth is more peppery for the stomach soup. In case those who are allergic or don't like pepper. The kidney does have a little blood when it comes out, not over cooking. If you're skirmish on the red, might want to pass.  Side veggies were decent, more to add green in the table not a must.  They will refill your soup. So get a big bowl of rice going.  They have a good drinks menu, but opted for the kung fu tea. The royal garden is the one they sell. You do have to make and prepare it yourself at the table. That's real tea service.  After the meal, you can also grab a couple boxes to make at home. Which I did, but will update my results on how it turns out.  They have multiple locations, but this one is located inside a shopping center near Chinatown. I visited one other location closer to Marina Bay and downtown, but doesn't have AC. This type of humidity and heat, not the best place to be consuming broth"

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,9-Aug-17,"After reading my previous review (Jumbo Seafood), you might ask: ""So what is the second ""must-try"" food when in Singapore?""  The answer is: bak kut teh from Song Fa (7 locations in Singapore). The literal translation of ""bak kut teh"" is ""meat bone tea"". It is more generally (and accurately) translated as ""pork rib soup"".  The story was that back in 1969 the founder of the chain sold this delicious soup made with pork ribs and a secret blend of spices in a push-cart stall. At the time he couldn't even afford a refrigerator and he had to store his ribs in the freezer from a friend's liquor store.  Today Song Fa is a household name in Singapore and the lines of each of its seven stores are always out the door into the streets and sometimes wrapped around the block.  But they were also very efficient - a server took our order while we were still standing in line and gave us a ticket from his iPad. Once we were seated our order arrived at our table very promptly.  The peppery broth was made with pork ribs, a blend of secret spices and lots of white pepper. The white pepper gave a distinct and strong flavor to the broth that was stimulating to the palate. The rib meat, which has soaked in the richness of the broth, fell off the bone effortlessly and was melt-in-your-mouth tender.  After you finish your ribs when there is more room in the bowl, you can ask for a refill of the soup. They will happily do that. In fact I saw some people ask for two or more refills.  While they probably won't tell you their secret recipe, they do sell boxes of pre-mixed packets of the spices at the cashier's counter. Yours truly actually bought a box of 10 packets, each of which is good for 4 - 6 servings. I am actually making the soup right now. I'll let you know how it goes when I see you next time."
Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.2,150,"Singaporean, Chinese",5,9-Aug-17,"After reading my previous review (Jumbo Seafood), you might ask: ""So what is the second ""must-try"" food when in Singapore?""  The answer is: bak kut teh from Song Fa (7 locations in Singapore). The literal translation of ""bak kut teh"" is ""meat bone tea"". It is more generally (and accurately) translated as ""pork rib soup"".  The story was that back in 1969 the founder of the chain sold this delicious soup made with pork ribs and a secret blend of spices in a push-cart stall. At the time he couldn't even afford a refrigerator and he had to store his ribs in the freezer from a friend's liquor store.  Today Song Fa is a household name in Singapore and the lines of each of its seven stores are always out the door into the streets and sometimes wrapped around the block.  But they were also very efficient - a server took our order while we were still standing in line and gave us a ticket from his iPad. Once we were seated our order arrived at our table very promptly.

Had to wait a bit for the table, but was able to put the order in before seating to quicken the turn. Works for me.  The pork rib soup here never disappoints. The flavor and heat on the broth was so good that I refilled probably 3 times or so. Yes, there's unlimited refill.  The fish soup was loaded to the top with plenty of fish and also had the same soup base as the pork. I was initially a bit thrown off because I was honestly expecting a fish based broth. It still worked since I like the pork broth anyway, but I will probably just stick with the pork rib soup next time. Bean curd was surprising good. I will probably get that again.  Have been very tempted to pick up some of the soup base that they sell... Not sure how much it will resemble the in store version if I'm the one cooking it..."

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",4,8-Aug-19,Bak Kut Teh - translates from Hokkien to mean pork rib tea. It's actually pork ribs soup served with a variety of side dishes.

Found this highly reviewed place so decided to head on over. Place was packed at 5 in the afternoon, luckily we got in right before the line started to form outside. It was my first try at this and the soup, ribs and sides were all really good. The ribs were fall off the bone soft and the soup was very tasty and flavorful. The only thing was service was not attentive and had to keep getting their attention for everything. They do refill your soup 2-3 times for free after you're done, which is awesome! I'd recommend this place if you want to get some pork rib soup, I'm glad I tried this and now I'm hooked!"

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,23-Apr-19,"I absolutely love this place for bak kuh teh (pork ribs soup)! The soup is flavorful and delicious, the meat is quite good, and you also can ask for unlimited refills of soup! I also would definitely recommend ordering the ÓÍÌõ to dip in the soup. They taste amazing together! I also personally prefer the Prime Spare Rib Soup over the standard Pork Ribs Soup. I find the texture to be better and the meat is much easier to eat as well.  Note that there can be a wait at times. I've been here a couple times for weekday dinners and usually have to wait about 10-20 minutes. There are actually 2 queues as well: one outside and one inside. The outside one tends to be shorter but has no A/C, so take your pick.  The prices here are also quite reasonable. The standard pork rips soup is S$7.30 for regular or S$9.50 for the large. You only get more meat with the large, and I think the soup is the best part so I'd go for the regular. The prime spare rib soup is S$8.90."

You can buy a ten pack of their spice packets to make at home for $22 SGD, which is equal or cheaper than going to the market.  You can ask for refills on the broth at all their locations. The meat is extremely tender and they often run out of the ""tender pork bone"" soup, which is really just baby back pork ribs instead of regular pork ribs. Traditionally, people get the pickled mustard greens to eat with it as well as maybe some rice. The chinese donut (yeow taow) goes well as a ""crouton"" in the soup.

Ordered their signature pork ribs soup, braised pork belly, braised fried beancurd, ngoh hiang, and assorted vegetables. Broth for the soup appeared very simple but had such a nice taste and they refill the broth for free. Pork belly and ngoh hiang (kind of sausage) were very tasty. Some in our group thought the pork belly had too much fat. Service was good and they give you a moist towelette."
Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",4,4-May-19,"Despite not being hungry since we had eaten at 5 other places already that morning, we found ourselves wanting to try Song Fa BKT before heading to the airport and leaving Singapore.  This location was the closest to us and we arrived around 1pm, not realizing that there would be a wait. Luckily, the wait was only around 15 minutes and the food came out quickly. Everyone was having some version of the famous fall-of-the-bone rib soup.  It was hearty and delicious. The clear soup was flavorful from the hours of cooking. That said, I think the rib soup I make at home is almost at good and I'm no genius in the kitchen."

Song Fa Bak Kut Teh,4.6,21,"Soup, Chinese",5,30-Aug-19,"I was in Singapore on a food hunting trip, and I couldn't pass on some bak kut teh - it's one of my favourite things to eat.  I arrived at a fairly late hour, after 8PM. I've heard there is typically a lineup, but being a solo diner at less-than-peak hours, I got seated right away. The place looks clean and bright, and people around me seem to be having a great time.  The service as I recall was really good. I ordered the staple, Prime Spare Ribs Soup (which comes with a bowl of rice), a plate of gai lan and the server suggested lemon barley water (which is made in-house). The total bill came out to be around 17 SGD.  The main event was amazing. I loved the white pepper flavour of the broth, and it warmed me up to my tippy-toes (good thing they have AC!). I did expect a bit more pork flavour, but it was really good nonetheless.  By the way, did I mention the broth is bottomless? The server came by at least 3-4 times to ask if I wanted a refill. It was so good it was hard to refuse, but at the end I was just too stuffed to have anymore.  The lemon barley tea was fantastic also, and hit the spot to alternate between the hot broth and the cold drink. The gai lan was on point, and very generous for the 4 SGD price tag.  Overall, I had a very satisfying time and I would definitely go back again given the chance to try more things. Hopefully next time I can go with more people to try more things on the menu!"

This place looked like it had great reviews so I though I'd give this a try. To be honest I don't even like most soups, or pork ribs, but I wanted to try something new and was hoping this place would change my mind... and oh it did.  I had dinner early so I missed the dinner rush lineup, and was seated right away. They gave me a stool for my belongings and a cloth to cover them. I ordered the small bowl of pork ribs soup with rice and water. The dish arrived literally immediately after I ordered. The meat was fall-of-the-bones tender, and the soup was a delightful mix of spices and it was so delicious it was nothing I could put words to. The soup was refillable too, and the waiters were constantly coming by to refill the soup. I seriously want to know what went into that soup but will likely never find out.  I wish I could be back, but I'm halfway across the globe now and still craving this. So, if you happen to be in Singapore, give this a try."

Wolf Burgers,4.3,15,Burgers,4,27-Mar-20,"Impossible truffle burger ($17.90) - 3.75 stars This was the first impossible burger I had and a great place to start! Excellent texture and flavouring - it was very tasty. They replicated the meat flavour well and I appreciated the beautiful lettuce it came with. It was topped with mushrooms and cheese. I docked 0.25 stars because it was too salty, and the last star for the bread, which tasted like a nicely toasted but regular hamburger bun, i.e. too soft and unsubstantial. I'm a huge bread person and the only burgers I've ever approved of have been gourmet ones with Real bread for buns. Solid, though I hardly crave burgers so I'm not sure I'd be back unless they could make it less salty and get a real loaf of bread."

I ordered the Chicken Curry burger with truffle fries. The chicken breast was so crispy and juicy and the curry complimented, not overpowered the taste. The turkey bacon was perfect too. You could've fooled me because unlike turkey bacon I had back in the US, this almost tastes like the real deal. Truffle fries were good too and I'm glad they didn't just pour the truffle sauce onto the fries. I'm glad they took their time to prepare my burger. Definitely worth another visit if I'm in the area. Not bad for ""mall food court"" food."
Wolf Burgers,4.3,15,Burgers,5,2-Dec-16,"Located at the Pasarbella enclave at Suntac city producing marvelously crafted burgers. The mushroom burger's patty is medium rare cooked, very delicious, coated with melted cheers with sliced saut¨¦ed mushroom piled on to and sandwiched with beautifully puffy and light bun. Over all the combination of smells, tastes and textures are so well put together that the burger rank up with the best I've had.  The buttermilk chicken burger is equally well crafted with a crispy from the outside succulent from the inside and very tasty.  This is my new go-to burger place!"
Wolf Burgers,4.3,15,Burgers,5,27-Jun-19,always been a big supporter of wolf. would drive distant to get my buger fix. today was just a big disappointment. got a soggy burger unlike wolf's standard. whoever cooked the burger needs to be retrained. not letting the meat rest could be the ussue here.  9/4 Well i previously gave a 1 star due to an absolutely soggy french dip burger but got a message/email from the owner himself inviting to make good and make good they did!!! Kudos to a biz/owner that can be bothered with customer feedback. Really do appreciate the boss taking the initiative to engage the customer and for that not only he won back a loyal customer and i am sure i shall be spreading the Wolf Gospel so to speak - thank you.

Wolf Burgers,4.3,15,Burgers,4,10-Jun-16,"What a fun burger place at Suntec's Pasarbella!  I came in wanting to try their signature Wolf Burger, but the staff was very good in convincing me to their their Alpha burger, which is their take on a double cheeseburger. Apparently they use a completely different beef for it, which could be why it's higher priced.  I wish I could've had my burger done medium, but I went for well-done just for pregnancy precautions (I know... I know...)  The burger itself was still very good; juicy and filling (after all, I was eating 2 patties; one for me, one for baby!) I'm pretty sure it'd be better if you order it medium!  Unfortunately the sweet potato fries were a miss. They tasted good, but they were either overcooked or not fresh, as there was no crispness in the fry. Maybe it's best to just stick to their regular fries, more turnover = fresher?"
Wolf Burgers,4.3,15,Burgers,3,29-Sep-19,"After being on vacation and eating tons of chicken and seafood for 10 days, we were craving burgers. I found this place on yelp. It was a little difficult to find as it is in a food court (Suntec's Pasarbella) and was not listed by itself in the mall directory.  We ordered 2 waygu beef burgers and the trio of fries. The burgers were good but nothing outstanding. It did seem to fulfill my craving for a burger though. The trio of fries included sweet potato fries, standard fries and fortune fries. Fortune fries are hard to explain but they are sort of airy fries that have a little bit of sweetness to them.  Overall, I think I have really high standards for a burgers but this place did the trick. Service was quick and easy."
Wolf Burgers,4.3,15,Burgers,3,23-Feb-19,The taste is just average. No wow factors. Service was quick and price reasonable for this level of taste. Perhaps a bit more sauce would help.
Wolf Burgers,4.3,15,Burgers,5,29-Mar-18,Ordered the double wolf burger and added egg and bacon. It was one of the best burgers I've ever had. This place is in a food court and was super crowded on a Thursday evening -- took a while to find a table. Also it took about 30 minutes for my burger to be ready after ordering. The staff were trying their best but it was really slammed.
Wolf Burgers,4.3,15,Burgers,5,6-Jun-19,"Great burgers!!! This place totally surprised me; going in I didn't think it woild be that good. I'm usually hard to please when it comes to burgers, so I didn't get my hopes up when I discovered the location was insife a mall. Back in the states, food court grub just ain't the best. The food was super good here though! The burger wasnt overcooked, the staff behind the counter were awesome, and the flavor was perfect. I got the Wagyu Burger and cheese fries, and my friend got the truffle fries. The truffle really pops! If I go back to Singapore, I'll for sure stop by again."
Wolf Burgers,4.3,15,Burgers,4,17-Jul-16,"I'm not a burger person which is why I was impressed by the chicken burger here. Good quality ingredients, delicious, filling. My friends had beef burgers which they enjoyed too.  Kimchi fries were not so good though. The fries were thin and airy (i guess it's the generic frozen kind) and the sauce was average."
Wolf Burgers,4.3,15,Burgers,4,21-Jun-16,"Came across Wolf Burgers at Pasarbella on a day I was meant to have a salad. I have no regrets on this one. I never say No to a burger experience.  Prices are very reasonable.  The Wolf was my first try and what made me fall in love with first bite. They suggested to go with Medium rare which makes the patty a melt-in-your-mouth-experience. The combination of the beef juices, cheddar cheese and caramelised onions all soaking the bun, makes it one of my favourite burgers in Singapore. Your hands will get messy, so make sure to have napkins on hand.  Tried the Buttermilk Fried Chicken on another occasion. The salted egg mayo and homemade slaw makes all the difference and what puts it above other chicken type burgers I've had from other joints. I can't fully describe this as you have to try it to be the judge.  Side of sweet potato fries never goes wrong, but I've always struggled to finish it cos the burgers make me 3/4 full.  Staff is friendly. Price is reasonable. Even if Pasarbella is crowded, if you have patience...wait til you get a table, otherwise, have it to go."
Wolf Burgers,4.3,15,Burgers,4,31-Aug-17,"Came here after a day of hiking and we're craving burgers. It was a little hard to find but once we followed other reviews that said it's located inside a little food court type place, we found it. Lots of other food options in the same food court--drinks, ice cream, coffee, other main meals. The burgers were good though nothing special, but the truffle Parmesan fries were delicious and so were the sweet potato fries. We also got a chocolate shake but weren't digging the crumbled malt balls on top."
Wolf Burgers,4.3,15,Burgers,5,29-May-16,"Holy shit their magic shrromz burger is just amazing. The meat is just perfect and the truffle hits you like a truck when you take the first bite. Their basic burger is not too bad, but it really can't beat their mushroom one. The salted egg yolk butter milk fried chicken isn't too bad either, but not really super salted egg yolks."

Our party of 4 made a reservation a couple weeks in advance and had no issues getting a dinner table secured. The venue had a modern and clean look. The hosts primarily spoke mandarin, but some could speak English as well. The chili crab was definitely an experience! You get a bib, gloves, and a wet wipe to tackle this meal. The crab was solid and the sauce was both sweet and had a bit of a kick to it as well. The dish is definitely messy! Probably not a first date spot, but definitely a cool experience. Please note the Chili Crab sauce has peanuts so if you have a peanut allergy, you'll want to avoid."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,3-Dec-23,"As one of the most popular chain restaurants for chili crab, I managed a reservation the day prior for 5pm. When I arrived, they noted that our reservation was only for 1.5hours or they'd have to move our tables. It was fine until they inform you that the chili crab may take 45 minutes, which I had no idea until we ordered. We also ordered some Kang Kong Veggies (SG$24), but weird that they brought that plate to us right away. Shouldn't they have waited to bring it out with our crab? Poor time management on their part. While we waited, someone also came around to all the tables offering some Fried Salted Egg Prawn Chin (SG$9.80). This was a pretty good snack and I really enjoyed the salted egg flavor on it.  Finally, our crabs came. First was the award-winning Chili Mud Crab (SG$153.40 for 1.3kg). Wow, this looked and tasted amazing. I have to say that the sauce on the crab really made this dish stand out. You definitely need the rice to soak up all the sauce. The best part was mixing the rice into the shell as a bowl and getting all the inside juices. Next, we also got the Signature Black Pepper Dungeness Crab (SG$107.80 for 1.1kg). Sadly, this one was just mediocre and I would've rather had more chili crab or tried some other dishes.  Overall, some hits and some misses. I'd mainly come for the chili crab though. That sauce is one of the best things I've tasted."

It looked great when it came out but it was mostly shell/emptied out crab body shell and a lot of sauce (I recommend pouring the extra sauce onto your rice or dipping it with the bao buns). When I think of Singapore's flavors, I think of a lot of spices, heat, and savory since Singapore is a diverse cultural country with roots from India, China, Malay and Indonesia. This dish was sweet with a very little delayed kick. It tasted as if they used sweet ketchup? Wasn't what I was expecting but I read reviews that we should have ordered the salted egg crab instead.  Location was overlooking the Clark Quay river and we loved the sights across the river as we people watched. Service was lacking but we felt horrible for our server.

This location is Clarke Quay is right near other bars and restaurants - so if you get an outdoor table (like we did) you'll have a great view. However, it does get loud later into the evening.  Chili crab is a must get, obviously!! It was so delicious - spicy but fragrant flavor - but make sure to get extra buns or fried rice to sop up all the yummy sauce after you finish the crab meat. Goes well with a Tiger beer or Coca Cola :)  Fried shrimp was meh - wouldn't get again. Would love to come back and try other dishes!"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,7-Dec-22,"I have to say that I wouldn't normally be penning a review about Jumbo, which in foodie Singapore is often a symbol of local chain big brand seafood. Snobbery aside, I have to say that a recent re-visit has renewed my faith in Jumbo's commitment to its humble roots in Singapore seafood cookery. This commitment is evident in its back-to-basics approach to the menu updates. While the menu is still an homage to the classics, the restaurant group has shown its interest in staying relevant to what concepts like HackIt! where one of my favorites is the Seafood Pack. An awesome idea that's finally taken shape out of a common practice, at least something that I've always done, drizzling generous amounts of chili crab sauce over the mee goreng. Chili crab sauce and ramen noodles...kudos HackIt! Till that makes it to the jumbo menu, just use my hack! Enjoy!"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,24-Nov-22,"My group ordered the following:  1. Baby lamb rack grilled with pepper and honey sauce: you have to order by piece so if youre ordering for a group, each person needs to order their own piece. It was pretty tasty and not gamey. Would not recommend if you do not like lamb... also the size was very small! But, the sauce was so yummy if youre a black pepper fan.  2. Crispy fried baby squid: I personally would pass on this. It just tasted like dried seasoned squid. Nothing special in my opinion.  3. Fried rice with diced chicken and salted fish: it was good but, kind of dry for my taste. Tasted really good if you mix the chilli crab sauce with it.  4. Half Alaskan chili crab with fried buns: this was my favorite. The sauce was really good and the crab was so juicy! The fried buns are a must with this dish. The buns were a good vehicle and carb for the sauce.  5. Half Salted egg yolk alaskan crab: this was ok. I was underwhelmed by it but it did have a nice salty crust but, I would just opt to try the black pepper or full chili crab the next time around.  I recommend making a reservation for this place as it can get quite busy at night time. We had to wait 10-20 minutes with our reservation on a Tuesday night. Overall, was a good dining experience."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,21-Sep-22,Best crab ever! When I think about the best whole crab dishes in my life this one comes to the very top. I still think about how delicate but incredibly flavorful the crab sauce was. It's something I can't recreate and have had anywhere but here. Just know that due to its incredible popularity it is busy and give yourself ample time to wait to be seated but it will be worth it.

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,11-Feb-20,"196 SGD (Singapore Dollar) for some crab and fish seems like we were gettin' played by our Singaporean brothas and sistuhs, but no, we just had no idea what the hell we were ordering. Just look at the sgd/gram and order the amount of grams u want to pay, or that will satisfy ur belly. Don't order an entire fish & crab if u don't want to spend close to 200 SGD!!  I must admit, the soon hock fish was phenomenal! Cooked to perfection in that wow, I can't believe garlic ever tasted this good sauce!! They don't make fish like THIS in the states!  The crab was delicious, but ma & pa makes me better crab, so gotta knock off a star. There was ample supply of crab meat & the meat itself was sturdy & full of flavor, but we didn't really enjoy the famous Singapore chili sauce that the crab was drenched in.  Service was nice as this was a super messy meal and our server provided us with a good supply of napkins and wet wipes. If u don't want to smell like u've just rolled in some fine fish and crab, u can wash ur hands at the sink inside the restaurant when u're all fished and crabbed out!  This is a seafood chain in Singapore, and unless u've dreamt of visiting Singapore just to get a taste of the seafood here, then just walk on by my friend, cuz u can have the same quality tasting seafood for a better price point at one of the many food hawkers around town!! Happy hawking!!!"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,2,19-Nov-19,"Holy cow! Totally wish we stuck with the street food and hawker stands. Waited all day to come try Jumbo Seafood for dinner and was so disappointed! The whole dining experience was meh. There was only one person taking orders, you can't just ask anyone to take your order or grab the server, you'd just get brushed off.  There were 4.5 of us dining, 4 adults and a child. We ordered the chili crab, Chinese broccoli, small order of fried rice, small order of noodles and 4 bamboo clams which was a little more than we were capable of eating. Nothing really wow'ed us, we were really underwhelmed especially for the price we paid.  Honestly, every hawker stand we tried, the food was SO good! Being that this was the most expensive meal of our trip, we were slightly bitter and disappointed."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,2,6-Apr-19,"Underwhelmed by the flavors and quality of the foods here. We arrived here on a Friday evening close to 8PM... we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table of 2. The restaurant was packed and there were people waiting outside. They provided waters and chairs for those waiting. The restaurant is along the riverside which provided a nice view and very close to Clarke Quay center.  We were seated at a large table with other groups of 2. It took awhile for the waiter to come by and take our orders; one of the customers had to flag the waiter down. We were provided tea and peanuts which we did not know cost additional. If we had known we would have skipped on the peanuts. We ordered the chili crab and pepper crab, along with fried rice and 2 buns. I don't know why my fiance thought it was a great idea to order 2 crab for just us 2.  The foods came out very slowly... and it did not make sense. The ones who ordered last got their foods first. It took about 20 more minutes until our foods came out. The chili crab sauce was not good... It had a fishy taste to it and the crab meat was stuck on the shell; might have been overcooked. The fried rice with fried fish chunks were tasty though! The pepper crab came out way too late... by the time the rest of the table left our pepper crab finally came and we were too full. We ate it anyways... the flavors were odd. I didn't enjoy the flavors too much.  At the end of the dinner I felt nauseous and had to go back to hotel. Something about the flavors made me nauseous. Total came out around $150 USD. Expensive! Napkins were non-existent. We asked for some but were ignored."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,21-Aug-19,"During my 3 days stay in Singapore in March of 2019, I cannot not try the Singapore Award Winning Chilly Crab here!! I was sooo excited to come, and I have to say, by far, it is the best crab I've ever had in my life!!  The sauce of the crab was soupy and you can dip with bread or donut. I just ate it by itself, and I finished the whole crab plus all the sauce!! Didn't waste any tiny bit!! Well, I did say it was the best crab of my life!!! During the past 5 months, I have tried a couple of Malaysian and Chinese restaurants in the Northeast and haven't found anything that was close to this!! I should have bought the Chilly Crab seasoning that the restaurant also sells!!  My bf didn't want to try any of my crab, because he heard from many people who got sick with food in Asia, and he was extremely careful! I didn't care because I was born and raised in Asia for 19 years before I came to the states!! He ordered a seafood clay pot instead, which looked boring haha! Well, that's his choice and nothing outside of the expectation!!!  But it is due to this disk that I am taking off a star!! He got very very sick after this disk! I am not sure if some of the fish cake that he got was old or he was just not used to the food, but he started going to the bathroom twice before I even finished my meal!! OMG, poor guy!!!  We stayed at the Marina Bay and he almost didn't make it back to the hotel! That was his experience in Asia: didn't get sick in a third world country, Vietnam, eating all the street food, but yet, got sick in a restaurant in Singapore, and it was not cheap! The bill came around $130 Singapore dollars! I know it was because of my chilly crab! His disk wasn't that expensive.  I still love my chilly crab and want to come back to Singapore for this, but next time, my bf for sure will just watch me eat!!!"

It's located by the river walk and patronized by a lot of out-of-town visitors.  FOOD Chili Crab - Very good but extremely expensive. I think we paid $50USD for 1 crab which is ridiculous, but I can see why it's so popular. The sauce is a delicious blend of sweet and spicy and perfect with rice or man tou (buns) on the side.  Man Tou - Yummy! They're slightly sweet and slightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Definitely recommend! I just wish they were a little bigger because you can eat one in 2 bites.  Noodles - I don't remember the name on the menu, but these noodles were super yummy. They were nice and sweet and spicy, and a decent amount for 2-3 people.  Chinese Broccoli - This was just ok. I'm not a fan of Chinese broccoli in general and thought this dish was a bit weird with the thousand year eggs and egg yolk.  SERVICE The servers are super busy here and we had to flag ours down multiple times. They're very nice though, and the food comes out fairly quickly, considering the amount of people in the restaurant.  OVERALL The food was good, but overall very pricey (especially their famous chili crab). But would I come here again? Yes, because even though it's touristy, the food is still good.  Oh, and that glass tray of yellow liquid on your table? It's just tea with lemon to wash your fingers with after eating crab. Don't drink it. You're welcome."

For that kind of money, I could go to an AYCE buffet in Vegas and get unlimited crab legs. The flavor is pretty mediocre too.  We ordered pea sprouts, but they were the baby kind, not the tastier, more mature kind. And some sort of scallops in taro which I could have done without. Actually I could have done without the whole meal.  There are two branches of the same restaurant within walking distance of each other -- make sure you go to the right one. Reservations recommended.

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,20-Mar-20,"My boyfriend and I came here for dinner while in Singapore and we were so happy we did. We ordered chilli crab, mantou buns, and cereal prawns. We loved everything and had a delicious meal.  We got the dungeness crab, which I highly recommend because it had a ton of sweet crab meat. It went really well with the chilli sauce. You must also get the mantou buns to sop up some of the sauce. They are deep fried, slightly sweet bread rolls that are absolutely delicious. I highly recommend getting both of these if you come here. We had chilli crab at a hawker center and enjoyed it, but preferred it with the dungeness crab we got here to the mud crab at the hawker center.  The cereal prawns were also delicious. They come butterflied in a crispy cereal coating, that has seasonings like chili and curry leaves in it. They are fairly mild in flavor, but were delicious. I highly recommend also getting these.  Service wasn't overly friendly but was fairly quick. The place is definitely more expensive than a hawker center will be, but not outrageously expensive. I would recommend coming here if you're looking for good chilli crab in a higher end place."

They come butterflied in a crispy cereal coating, that has seasonings like chili and curry leaves in it. They are fairly mild in flavor, but were delicious. I highly recommend also getting these.  Service wasn't overly friendly but was fairly quick. The place is definitely more expensive than a hawker center will be, but not outrageously expensive. I would recommend coming here if you're looking for good chilli crab in a higher end place."
Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,22-Dec-18,"A must-visit for visitors to Singapore, Jumbo Seafood is the place to come for the classic Singaporean dish of chili crab! It's messy (wear a bib!), it's spicy, it's sweet--it actually reminds me of the classic Chinese tomato and egg dish (perhaps not surprising since the sauce contains both these ingredients)! The cracked pieces of crab are delicious, and the sauce is perfect over some rice or with some fried, crispy mantou on the side!  But chili crab isn't the only thing to get here--the vegetables stir-fried with sambal were full of shrimpy goodness, the seafood fried rice was a simple classic, and the scallops in fried yam rings were a surprising addition as well! But perhaps one of the most memorable and unusual dishes was the shrimp covered with cereal. When I saw this on the menu, I thought that the cereal was just the breading for the shrimp, but when the dish came, I saw that the dish had way more cereal than shrimp! Luckily, the crispy, sweet cereal was an absolutely delicious part of the meal, even eaten on its own!"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,1,6-Jul-22,"Food is okay. Service is terrible. Have low expectations and things may turn out fine for you. Please note if you have nut allergies, I'd advise not coming here. The chili crab, all the shrimp dishes have nuts or nut oil. Very little meat on the crabs so make sure you add on additional items if you don't want to leave hungry. Our server took my credit card to settle the bill and after 20-30 minutes when she didn't return, I asked for it only to be informed she lost it and needed time to track it down. No fun."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,24-Jan-18,"A must-try when you're in Singapore. SO YUM. I'm drooling now as I write this review.  I definitely recommend the chilli crab with lots of fried buns. We ordered that along with some veggies and fried rice. I would opt out of the fried rice and order extra buns instead. The chilli sauce is scrumptious. You would want to eat it all up.  We got lucky and were able to walk in without a reservation. We sat outside while it was lightly drizzling, but we were not uncomfortable at all. The outdoor part of the restaurant had umbrellas to shield us from the rain, and the waiters provided covers to protect our belongings."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,9-Dec-19,"Jumbo seafood is the place to go for crabs. My parents actually went there three out of the four days that we were in Singapore. With all the food choices, that's a big endorsement.  Unfortunately, they were out of the Alaskan crab the night that I went, but we opted for Dungeness crabs and they were still delicious. Everybody raves about the chili crab, but to me the salted egg crab was slightly better, but honestly, you can't go wrong with either choice. The chili crab has a thick sauce and a light heat that lingers. The salted egg is a little dryer but the saltiness goes great with the crab. The fried rice was also a winner but the crabs are why you come here.  Sure, it's a little pricey, but it's well worth it. You can't come to Singapore without stopping by a Jumbo Seafood location to grab some crabs."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,29-Jul-17,"If chili crab is something you must try when visiting Singapore, then Jumbo Seafood is one of the best places to try it. Yes, it is a chain restaurant that is very pricey and very crowded, requiring a reservation if you want to avoid a long wait in the unrelenting heat. And if this is your first time trying chili crab, it will invariably fall short of your lofty expectations. But you should definitely still eat here when given the chance, because despite all this, the food is delicious.  I personally favored the black pepper crab, which came smothered in a potent pepper sauce packed with a subtle kick, although the chili crab was delicious as well. Sopping up all of the sweet and spicy chili sauce with the fried buns was a most satisfying experience. The salted egg prawns were a pleasant surprise, with the egg yolk providing a mild flavor and interesting texture, while the sweet and crispy fried baby squid made for a perfect little appetizer.  Despite being a bit of a novelty, there is no doubt that Jumbo Seafood prepares some quality seafood and a mean version of chili crab. If you're willing to deal with the steep prices (they charge for everything including the peanuts and wipes), the lackluster service and are lucky enough to score a reservation in the air conditioned section, you will be treated to a very tasty meal."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,9-Mar-20,"I was recommended this restaurant by someone who grew up in Singapore, so I had to trust their recommendation!  I highly recommend purchasing the Klook voucher before you come here as the food is quite expensive here. I ordered a chilli crab, and while it was absolutely delicious, it would cost me about 100 SGD if I had not purchased the Klook voucher.  I came here for lunch and since I was here on my own, it took about 20 minutes to get a seat without a reservation. They asked if I minded sharing a table with another party, and I said no because I knew I would get seated sooner. I was seated next to a girl about my age and her mother, so it was all pleasant.  I ordered the smallest size chilli crab and used my hands to break into the crab, along with the tools they provided to crack the shell. I noticed some other people were provided with gloves, and I think it's not fair that they did not even mention that they had gloves available. Maybe this would be something I'd be aware of if I ate more messy seafood or if I were a Singapore local?  Big note: They will offer you peanuts and tea as if they don't cost extra, but they do!! So if you're trying to save some money, refuse the peanuts and tea. Just get some water (though that still costs extra regardless of choosing bottled or tap water).  Another note: They don't have napkins or anything at the table, so if you need wet napkins, definitely call someone over to provide you with some. You will definitely need wet wipes because chilli crab gets messy.  Anyway, the chilli crab was very delicious; I basically devoured the chilli sauce and the crab was yummy too. The DIY breaking into the crab was fun but super messy. I'd probably be happy with having any seafood with the chilli sauce, but without the mess.  Since I am just one person, I wasn't able to try any of the other delicious items they have. I hope I'll be back here with some friends and try the cereal prawns!"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,5-Aug-17,"My friend took me here for Chili Crab because it's the must do thing in Singapore and this is a popular spot overlooking the water (Singapore River). The ambiance was amazing...the wait is super long so you definitely have time to grab a happy hour drink nearby. You put your name in the queue and they will call you when your table is ready. You can request your own table or a shared table which is probably quicker to get seated at. They quoted us 90 minutes but we were seated in less then 45.  Now, on to the food. Though we tried the chili crab, my friend told me her favorite was the salt and pepper (which I wish we got instead). The chili crab is good but a bit too sweet for me (it's basically doused in sweet chili sauce - the kind you might dip your eggroll in). I prefer my crab on the savory side. We also got the fried rice - LOVED it. Morning Glory was to DIE FOR. And their special bread was a must to dip in the crab sauce!  It seems almost impossible to have a bad meal in Singapore so this is another good one! I enjoyed myself and left with a food coma!"

It was not too spicy and I really believe the chili crab here is better than those at No Signboard at Esplanade.  Black pepper crab - that's a B.

This dish was good but those at No Signboard at Esplanade is slightly better.  Fried buns - A+ Despite someone commenting I have ""become fatter"" *eyes rolling* just last week, I have been indulging in fried food. The buns here were golden and crispy on the outside, and so soft in the inside. This definitely complements the Chili Crab. Definitely order these buns to go with the Chili Crab.

They removed the sodas which was nice but holy hell the entire experience was just terrible.

They start you out rushed by telling you when you have to leave by which doesn't really start the meal out well. Honestly for how much hype I've seen about this place it really missed hard. $200 for decent crab but blah for everything else and the service is just terrible. Will never go there again."
Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,3,5-Jan-20,"Not worth the hype. Crab was good, but service was mediocre. Got in right away but we were there 10 mins before they opened. They forgot two of our entrees we ordered. Very nice servers, super crowded- clearly a local and tourist favorite. $$$$ dinner and we still left a bit hungry. Good location. Close to marina bay and other restaurants if the wait gets too long!"

I heard it is a pretty expensive place so keep that in mind.  We also got the fried rice which is fabulous with the chili crab sauce, some fish, and Chinese brocolli.  Try it if you are strolling down Clark quey."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,12-Aug-17,I had a reservation but I arrive to the restaurant one hour early and they were able to seat us outside right away.  They ran out of small crabs so my mom and I ordered medium to share. The size of the crab was just right. It gets really messy and I saw some local people bringing in their own plastic gloves and wipes. How smart and professional :)  You have to order the fried bread to dip in the chili sauce. It is so heavenly! I didn't find the price is particularly expensive for the crab itself but I thought the side dishes and drinks are quite high. Stir fried spinach for 15 dollars....umm I don't think so.  The customer service is just okay...nothing special. I wish they kept the bathroom clean because even the basin was really disgusting.

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,20-Oct-17,"This place was recommended to my sister and I by someone to order the chili crab specifically. During my trip, chili crab was everywhere! I do wish I had tried it elsewhere to give a comparison however I'm not mad with only having eaten it here. My sister and I got one crab to share which was more than enough. It's truly the sauce that makes this dish so great. I love tomatoes, anything tomato based I'm typically a fan right off the bat and their sauce has a tomato-y base that is sweet and spicy and so addicting! I'd pour the sauce on anything and eat it that how good it is.  We also ordered the ho fun, sadly I didn't take a picture of it but is really good! The gravy was very flavorful. My sister and I love the chili crab sauce so much that we even ended up mixing it with our noodles. Finger licking, bowl slurping good."

But I must say, it was VERY pricy for the crab. Also I thought the flavours hadn't really penetrated the crab. It tasted more like ketchup and sweetness than a savoury food which was really disappointing. The rice and buns were okay. Maybe because the location was in a very central location, which was why it was busier and more expensive? I would suggest trying somewhere else?  Tip: the peanuts they offer you at the beginning cost money, so if you don't want to eat them, don't let them put it down."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,26-Jan-18,"When you visit Singapore, you have to have Chili Crab. Period.  Coming here for a work trip, I let my coworkers do the planning. Night one after arrival, we found ourselves here. There were 6 of us, and I thought my (male) coworkers were joking when they said we were going to order 4 crabs. At about $60/crab...say what?!?1 But wanting to have the full experience, I acquiesced. The final menu for our table:  - 4 crabs (2 chili, 2 black pepper) - an order of the tiger prawns - fresh steamed abalone - fried rice - bok choy (because you need your greens)  The crabs were good, but to be honest, I enjoyed the black pepper crab better than the chili crab, which was marinated in so much tomato sauce that it was actually quite difficult to eat. The tiger prawns though....this was worth it. It was about $15/skewer (of ONE prawn) but it was one of the best prawns I have ever had. The abalone was silky smooth. The fried rice and bok choy were as good as fried rice and bok choy can be, but nothing out of this world.  The total bill was a whopping $700SGD...ouch! But when in Rome, right? I am glad we tried it, but at these prices, I am not so sure it was worth it. I wish I had a point of comparison, and should have tried it at other places, but that will have to wait for the next trip. I would definitely recommend a go at the Abalone and for sure the prawns. This is what upped it from a 3 to 4 star in my books.  p.s. I truly do appreciate they have a hand-washing station. A definitely must! =)"

It was definitely disappointing to speak to a manager who's more defending himself rather trying to accommodate his customers.

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,18-Feb-16,"When in Singapore, it seems chili crab is a must try. So my sister and I trekked over to this location before our flight. Luckily for us, there was no wait! I think we arrived right before the lunch crowds poured in - it got really busy as we were eating.  The chili crab was something we definitely had to get but my sister also wanted to try the cereal prawns. I noticed the menu had a prix fixe for two people (150 SGD) which included a variety of items. Although the price tag was steep, who knew when we would be back in Singapore! We took the plunge and I would say I am pretty happy with our decision. We were able to try a variety of items including lychee soda, dragonfruit lobster salad, fried rice with egg, cereal prawns, chili crab, and a pomelo sago dessert. I loved the lychee soda - refreshing and not too sweet. My least favorite item was actually the dragonfruit lobster salad - it was literally just chopped dragonfruit mixed with lobster and mayo. The fried rice with egg was pretty good and came in a huge portion (I think this could have been enough for 4 people)!  The star of the show, the chili crab, was DELICIOUS! The crab meat was juicy and flavorful. The sauce was not as spicy as I thought it would be - in fact, it was pretty sweet. However, it was still really good and tasted fantastic when you dipped the fried mantou in the sauce. I also enjoyed the cereal prawns which literally tasted like shrimp covered in crushed cereal! Sounds weird but it was yummy! We ended our meal with a spectacular dessert of pomelo and sago. I would give Jumbo Seafood five stars if not for the spotty service. The girl working the front seemed really frustrated and was not very welcoming. The waitstaff inside were very nice and friendly, but service was very slow."

The girl working the front seemed really frustrated and was not very welcoming. The waitstaff inside were very nice and friendly, but service was very slow."
Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,27-Jan-16,"This was my only chili crab experience and I sort wished I ate it again. The two of us shared the chili crab with the fried buns. We didn't eat any rice, just fried buns. We used the buns to soak up all the chili sauce. That was the absolutely best part!  They do charge you for the peanuts and the tea. It's kind of annoying because we didn't asked for neither. But oh well, the meal was still pretty great."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,20-Jun-16,"Like all the other yelpers are saying-- chili crab. that would be what you HAVE to get here. i don't care if that's the only thing you get, as long as you get chili crab! & the bread rolls that can be dipped into the delicious sauce.  this joint is probably most frequented by tourists. *cough* me * cough* my cousins took me and my grandma here while we were visiting them because they were famous for their chili crab. & apparently even won awards. as they should.  although i didn't get to try pepper crab, their salted egg crab was also delicious as well. it's damn messy so take your foodporn pictures before digging in because you will need to spend some time apart from your precious phone to enjoy this Singaporean delicacy.  *tip: the crab meat itself might taste kind of bland because it's protected from communication with the chili sauce by that damn shell, SO tip the meat into the sauce for a better tasting experience~  you can sit outside or inside. the inside has AC. so, for all you people who don't like sweating while eating, be sure to make a reservation for a table indoors. otherwise, prepare to get a workout in while eating crab in that humid Singapore weather.  all in all, i want to come back here the next time i'm back in the country!"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,1-Mar-19,This place is good if you are visiting the Clarke quay/boat quay area. I can't say it's the best chili crab because it's the first time having. The establishment was very busy and the whole area is busy at night. The chili crab had good taste and I recommend trying it if you are visiting. After the first piece I said I'm getting it again the next day but by the end of the meal I was satisfied.

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,16-Feb-19,"Jumbo is a 'must go stop' for me whenever I am back in Singapore for vacation. Jumbo has numerous outlets across Singapore and this review is for The Riverwalk outlet.  Their baby squid appetizer is a must have.They are crunchy with the right amount of sweetness. I had the herbal live Prawns, cereal prawns, mocha ribs and many other dishes. All were delicious. Service was great too as staff were very attentive.  However, my dining experience was spoiled by a company having their staff dinner celebration. They were obnoxious with their loud 'yum shengs' throughout the duration I was there. While I understand it is Chinese New Year, I feel that party should have spared a thought for other diners in the restaurant. Maybe Jumbo can advise big parties to be mindful with their noise level next time as this restaurant is rather small and any noise is amplified in this enclosed airconditioned area.  I talked to a service staff abt the noise disturbance and the management served my party with a complimentary dessert. A nice gesture by the management of Jumbo. While I appreciate the nice gesture, I would have preferred to enjoy my dinner without the noise disturbance.  I recommend this seafood restaurant and hopefully next time, I will not be dining with large noisy groups."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,23-Nov-18,Great chili crab was in Singapore for business and I craved this place everyday after my first try. The young coconut was so sweet I had to get one to go!

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,1-Oct-15,"The best advice is not what to order here, it's to avoid the lines somehow. The first location had too long of a wait and sent us to the second location, where the wait was a measly 45 minutes.  When we finally got a seat we ordered the benchmark Chili Crab, kang kong sambal, and scallops in purple yam. We also ordered the Lychee Italian soda and the green apple Italian soda. The drinks looked pretty and tasted much better than imagined. I wasn't drink that night but damn a beer would have gone so well with that crab. The crab is swimming in sauce that is pretty damn close to perfection. I wish I had just some plain white rice and could have engorged in that stuff alone. The crab was fresh and good. The kang kong was our way of trying to justify eating an entire crab and the scallops were just as good. Second piece of advice, the scallops with the crab sauce is a large improvement over the house sauce.  The bill was a bit high but not unexpected for an entire crab. Would eat again with more folks to feel less guilty."

The cereal pawn is sweet and quite tasty. When ordering they will ask you with shell or no shell. We went with the no shell one and felt that we made the right decision! As the pawns are coated with the cereal.  The crab was more than enough for two people. It comes with so much sauce that you should order rice to eat up some of the sauce!  As we were sitting outside - we also ordered a jug of lime aloe juice to share.  Everything was really good! Just be careful of the service. They will charge for everything. When we got our bill, we noticed that we were charged for:  - the peanuts that were given to us - the tea they poured us - 10% service charge"

It was delicious, although I think I would have preferred the black pepper crab instead. BUT, you get a yummy sauce for some bread with the chili option, so depends if you're in a dippin' mood or not.  I gave it 3-stars mostly because the service was very very average. Everyone around us seemed to be taken care of, while we felt ignored for 90% of our meal. I realize the service-standard is completely different in the US of A compared to many parts of the world, but it was enough to make us leave in a hurry.  If you're just looking for some good food and don't mind fighting a bit to get drinks or napkins (it gets extremely messy, as you can imagine!), then I think Jumbos is worth a visit."

Service While you might expect the service at a chain restaurant to be sub par, you'd be wrong about that at this particular Jumbo restaurant. The service was notably great. They were attentive, efficient, mindful of the number of guests in our party, and quick to keep us updated on the status of our cooking crabs. One manager even went out of his way to convince us NOT to order so much. He saved us $100 and a night of misery. That was very hospitable and ethical of him.  Food OMG. If crab was meant to be served and eaten by gods, then there ought to be no other way to serve or eat crab than this. The perfect balance of sweet, tangy, salty, and spicy. I don't know how else to describe the succulent taste that enraptures your taste buds. We ordered both the Chili Crab and the Blk Pepper Crab. Both excellent. But above I am speaking of the Chili crab.  Environment Excellent location. The restaurant is always jamming. But they do a good and efficient job of spacing everyone apart. I HIGHLY recommend you making reservations.  If you are in Singapore, you will/must try this joint."

I tried their chili crab & black pepper crab in different session, both are nice!  Chili crab comes with a lot of sauce that's good with a bowl of white rice;  The black pepper crab is my favorite! It's dry compare to the chili crab, there's no sauce but it's more intense and flavorful to me!  It's about ~$90SGD/crab after tax for the smallest size you can pick.  I ordered some other rice dish and vegetable dish because some of my family dont eat seafood, the dishes were ok but definitely not worth the price.  Again, come here for the crab and you will not be disappointed!  Tips: Line/queue might be long, so try to make reservation before you come!"

Overall my experience was just ok. The service was a little weird as they kept trying to deliver things i hadn't ordered and after accepting one of the items realized at the end that they just charge you for it (I guess its like up selling) I told them I did not want the tea or peanuts and noticed on my bill they removed these items (so they were going to charge me!)

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,18-Mar-18,"This place was packed when we came. Fortunately they have a good digital line approach. The ambience is nice because it's right on the water in the Clarke quay area. So there is lots of people watching and fun stuff to see in the surrounding area. We ordered the chili crab and broccoli. The sauce on the chili crab was great! Also the crab was fresh and delicious. You can tell everything is made to order. The broccoli was too oily for me but it was cooked to the right tenderness. The service was fine..fast and efficient but not very friendly.  Bottom line...come here for the ambience and the chili crab!! Expect New York style service...it's fast, it's efficient but there is no relationship building  Pros Clarke quay area On the water Fast service Good digital line service  Cons Service could be much friendly"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,1-Feb-18,"I can't say enough great things about the amazing crab dishes we had here!! We went after getting repeated recommendation/vouches for the jumbo seafood as the ""go to"" place to try Singaporean chili crab even though at first we were hesitant due to the fact that it was a chain joint. However, despite a bit of difficulty getting reservation (we used the app Chope) and slowness in service, I have to say the food itself was AMAZING! :) For the two of us, we ordered 1 veggie dish saut¨¦ed in garlic sauce and one chili crab and they were both a pure delicacy! We got medium spiciness and was just perfectly sauced, spiced, cooked/steamed and cracked (to be eaten easily). What a joy! We then proceeded to order a Pepper crab which was warmed in delicious butter and exotic black pepper and it was like experiencing a whole new world, a world's apart journey in flavor from the chili crab. Yum!! I'd recommend both since they are very different, but if I had to choose one, would probably go with the classic (chili crab). Also beware that the crabs are not cheap - about $70 SGD a piece - so be prepared to spend some $$$ if you're willing to adventure on trying both! Next time I definitely want to try their buns to dip it in the chili sauce as well as the fried rice!  Also I'd highly recommend this location located by the beautifully lit Singapore River as it's only a short walk to all the beautiful sights and sceneries by the water as well as the Fullerton Hotels and the Merlion :)"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,3,8-Dec-17,"During our visit we swung by and tried the crabs like tourists do.  The service when in the restaurant was on par with a busy chinese restaurant. What tainted our experience was the hostess at the other Jumbo location on Merchant road (not sure where this review most appropriately fits).  Being tourists, our cab dropped us off at the Merchant road location, right in time for our reservation at the Riverwalk. Once they let us know we were in the wrong spot, we asked if they would let the other location know we were on our way. The hostess said she would not. Having a toddler in tow did not elicit any sympathy from the hostess, and she reminded us we had 10 minutes left to make our reservation before it was given away.  Eventually, the food was good. I have never had chili crab, and thought it was okay. The fried buns are a bit greasy, I would stick with the regular ones. The food is pricey as expected.  I thought it was a good one-time food experience. I do not feel the need to go back and visit again."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,22-Dec-17,"People kept mentioning the chili crab at Jumbo so I had to give it a try. There are few locations throughout the city but we heard the Riverwalk location was great and so that's where we went. I recommend sitting outside so you have a view of the water. My two friends and I shared a chili crab ($70SGD), pepper crab ($78 SGD), small fried rice (enough for 3 or 4 ppl), broccoli and the fried buns. I loved every bite of everything. The sauce for the chili crab was great for dipping the fried bun. Eating the crab involved some work so don't try to be dainty while getting into it. They give each guest a little bowl of water for washing so that comes in handy.  Minor thing to call out, they put peanuts on the table for snacking before the meal comes out, you think it's free but there's a small charge. I've also heard they sometimes charge for the napkins (which you'll need) so ask before taking a big stack. Overall, this place is slightly price given it's a chain restaurant but it was a good meal!  Make sure to call for a reservation. We had a 7pm rez and had until 8:30 to finish, I didn't feel rushed but I'm sure they would have notified us had we overstayed out time. There's another location just a short walk on the Clarke Quay Riverside walk so make sure to go to the right location."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,13-Oct-14,"It's all about the crabs, the chili crabs specifically.  This is the go-to place for the extended family, especially when relatives are here from overseas. Somehow there is something about eating crabs which brings the family closer. Maybe it is the mess where everyone just digs in using our hands and fingers, trying to pry the sweet meat from the shells.  Bibs are now provided so you don't get gravy stains on your tops.  The must order dish is the chili crab, plus the fried mini buns (mantous) to soak up the addictive spicy sweet chili gravy. The rest is an afterthought. The food is generally decent but for the fried rice and hor fun, they lacked the wok hei flavor of tze char. Sambal kang kong, fried tofu, cereal prawns and the likes are just ok or average.  The service is fast and there are two seatings. The first is from 5.45pm to 7.45pm and with the speedy way they served the dishes, our two tables were done within 90 minutes. Lots of eating and less talking I guess.  Getting to the place is a bit of a hassle, if you have elderly or those who can't walk well in your dining party, as they are plenty of steps to navigate. Parking is available at The Riverwalk (turn into Upper Circular Road) or at the URA parking lot behind.  I much prefer Dempsey location which is equally crowded."

Chilli Crab is expensive, I get it, but the quantity we got just wasn't the best for the price we paid. Other than that, though, now that that is out of the way, the food was freaking delicious and the reservation system online was really easy and convenient to use. The decor inside is very pleasant and comfortable and the servers were very helpful and polite, which made the atmosphere and experience good for us. Also the salted egg golden prawns were an excellent appetizer, along with the mantou bread to drench in our chilli crab sauce. Would still recommend coming to this place if you've never had chilli crab or are dying to get chilli crab, but I won't be back for a while after being underwhelmed by the quality:value ratio of Singapore's National Dish."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,29-Jan-13,"Well folks, this former New Yorker is now officially Singaporean!  From what I understand, Jumbo Seafood is an establishment here in Singers and I am happy to say that I enjoyed Chilli Crab, Pepper Crab and Drunken Shrimp here!  My husband and I came by with some fellow ex-pat friends who were visiting from Kuala Lumpur. Even with a reservation on a weeknight, we had to wait another 20 minutes for a table. But once we sat down it didn't take long for them to take our order and deliver our starters.  The drunken shrimp tasted exactly like I thought it would, in a flavorful broth with a hint of liquor. The pepper crab tasted like pepper crab should. I'm always amazed at how they can get the meat to taste all peppery even though the crab shell is tough to break through! And of course, the granddaddy of them all- chilli crab. I liked this version a lot because it did have a little kick to it, but not to the point where I was sweating balls.  The service was good, even though the restaurant was fully booked. I also found it kid friendly, as our table did have a toddler, there were other smaller kids at the tables nearby us, and none of the other diners seemed to mind. Perhaps it's because we're all wearing bibs, given how messy crab can get, so we all look like children anyway.  Overall, a solid place to bring tourists (or just your local selves!) to experience Singaporean realness. Just remember that this location is NOT to be mistaken for ""Riverside Point"", which is located in the heart of Clarke Quay. I made that mistake while reserving, since this location is called ""The Riverwalk"". But no worries, as they are only about a 5-7 minute walk apart."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,25-Dec-13,"This place is the holiest of holy sites in Singapore when it comes to seafood.  If you want ridiculously tasty Chili and/or Black Pepper Crabs - this is the place to go, especially if you only have time to visit one particular seafood restaurant in Singapore.  If you go with the Chili Crab, make sure to get the fried mantou so you can dip it in the oh-so-delicious sauce. If you go with the Black Pepper crab, you'll be happy as well, so long as you don't mind looking absolutely disgusting after you finish you meal. Good thing they have huge sinks here for you to wash your face and hands.  There's plenty of other dishes that should be on your list - such as the incredibly tasty steamed fish, drunken prawns, even the salted fish fried rice is a must try. Their mango desserts are also excellent and remember to wash it all down with a nice big ol' coconut juice.  But there are some things to note as well:  1. The peanuts here are not free. There are still plenty of instances of nickel-and-diming bullshit in Singapore and this is an example of it. Be sure to tell them right off the bat you don't want the peanuts and that you don't want to be charged for it.  2. Same deal with the tea. That shit ain't free. If you don't want to pay - tell them. Ask for water instead.  3. Also remember the crabs are charged by weight. Make sure you ask for the size of your crab and the cost per kilo before you order. Otherwise, you might get stuck with a $100 dollar order of crab and not realize it.  Another weird thing I noticed on my most recent visit ... I ate here three times and on all three occasions nobody ever bothered to return my change. I had to bitch and moan each time to get my money back ... what gives??? (Btw - they do include a service charge in the meals FYI)"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,24-Oct-12,"Chili crab, chili crab, chili crab -- that was all I heard about from everyone who came back from Singapore. So naturally, this was on the list of must-eats during the trip. I had emailed a co-worker based in Singapore, what were some of the recommendations to eat while in the city? It's like asking a NYC local where was the best place to get pizza.  She mentioned chili crab at Jumbo Seafood, and so when my wife's friend's family took us here, I was more than happy. They have several locations, but the one we went to was next to the waters. The view was fantastic, especially at night, and they had plenty of outdoor tables. It bustling with people enjoying chili crab and other local seafood.  We ate a ton of food, but let's talk about the chili crab. The crab isn't your standard Dungeness crab that we're all used to in the states. They used Sri-Lankan crabs, which had huge, meaty claws. The crab meat was succulent -- nice and sweet, extremely juicy and tender. It was a like giant, delicious mutant crab.  As for the chili sauce, it's hard to describe, but it's similar to the dipping sauce that Brodard uses for their pork spring rolls -- only chunkier with more crab meat inside, with a lot more complex flavors, and ton spicier. I'm talking really spicy. Maybe it was because I was practically drinking the stuff, with the help of the fried and steamed bread (man-tou) sopping up the juices. Then I washed it down with some local Tiger beer. Man, was it good. If this was in the states, I'd be a bona fide regular."

They also give you a time limit to eat...talk about speed eating  The delicious damage (see my photo): - Spicy Chili Crab (of course) - Scallop Yam ring (I liked it) - Salted Egg Prawns (I liked it, saucy and little salty) - Mongolian Beef (Good but nothing special) - Chicken Skewers (Again good, but nothing special) - Crispy Pork Belly (Holy shit goodness...A must have!)  Don't take the service personal, its just how the restaurant operates. A must have meal when in Singapore! ENJOY!!!"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,7-Oct-17,"I wish I could fill a bathtub of the sauce they use on the chili crab and have my wife give birth to our first born son in it. Ok that maybe a bit much but that's how I felt when I tasted that crab for the first time last night. I'd recommend getting a side of white rice to put the leftover sauce from the crab on. Also got the veal which was solid, but nothing so outstanding I haven't had at other places. Don't really think it warranted the $40 price tag.  Aside from the food, environment was pretty nice and obviously in the very popular river walk Area. It was pretty lit on a Friday night. Recommend this spot for people visiting or for a special date that you met somewhere other than Tinder."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,1,5-Oct-16,"This place is extremely shady. My friend and I came here to try their crab around 9:30pm. Our waitress told us they only have one last Alaskan king crab left that would cost about $600. Our first reaction was holy &$@/. We even asked her if she was sure if that was the only type of crab left and if we could get any other type of smaller crab, but she promised us that it was the last one and even spoke to the back with her transponder to ""save the LAST crab for me"". She even promised us that it would not be too much for 2 people. I thought it was weird that this place would run out of its signature dish so quick, but since I'm only here for 2 days, I decided to get it.  Then as more customers came and ordered smaller crabs, we called her over to question her and she denied everything and saying she only said that was the last Alaskan crab.  Now I would forgive her if we didn't ask her 3 times to make sure that was the last of any crab and if she didn't quote ""save the LAST CRAB for me""...  They also charge everything from peanuts to water, and they WON'T tell you unless you ask. So definitely watch out for that since they bring out the peanut to you without you asking for it like it was free."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,1,4-Apr-16,"I was VERY disappointed with nearly every aspect of this place -- let's chat about the basics: 1) it was outdoors on tarmac, exposed to bugs and whatever blew by. 2) the washrooms had NO SOAP nor dryer or towelling -- this washroom was used by the STAFF who prepared and delivered food to tables as well as patrons. Any place in where there is no proper hand-washing facilities concerns me greatly. This last fact should close them down for sanitation review!  The photos of the food on the menu did NOT match what arrived in several cases. The low quantity and low quality of the food for the high price charged was simply outrageous. They seemed more interested in upselling alcohol than serving food, once they knew you weren't going to be drinkers, the wait-staff ignored us for quite a while before coming back to place our order. When the food was ready, it was rushed to the table in an effort to turn the table as soon as possible. They charged $78.00 for a single chopped up crab (a/k/a crab bits) was more than a bit pricey for what you got. For $22.00 you get a 3-cm cube of codfish. Six tiny scallops surrounded by an enormous amount of yam cost $18, again not worth the price and they tasted oily.  Maybe they were good at one time, that's not the case any more -- at least not tonight, and for a bill over $200.00, you'd expect that you'd get quality service and quality food with a hand-wash facility for patrons and staff that had the basic necessities.  All-in-all, I have nothing positive to say about this place and need to simply state that this seems to be an expensive, low-quality tourist trap for those that don't know any better. Avoid at all costs and seek Singapore Chilli Crab elsewhere -- ask a LOCAL. We'll never return."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,2,14-Sep-19,I love jumbo and the one in Ion Orchard is great.  Servers here are ridiculously slow and system is so inefficient. Lets say if you order bun in big room. Someone bring buns and put on their common table then my server comes and serve them to customers. So fucking ridiculous. Why not serve buns to me directly. So my bun was there in front of me and I had to wait for fucking 10min to get this cold bun.  Besides customers nearby me ordered bun and they forgot and asked them again like in 15min.  Love dish but attitude and efficiency need to be improved here. I wont come back and will keep going to the one in Ion Orchard.

I am actually drooling. Seriously.  If you like seafood, this is a busy, happening place, hectic and crazy, so not for a romantic dinner (especially with your bib and ripping into the crab. This is a great, great place to bring a bunch of people to start off a nice rowdy evening."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,2,19-Aug-16,"This was a serious disappointment for me. Definitely recommend making rezzies BC the wait can be very long. I was looking forward to trying the chili crab, but price to taste ratio was not worth it in my opinion. Almost 80USD for one crab drenched in s tomato chili sauce with scrambled egg. The garlic butter crabs in San Francisco were much better and half the price. For sides we had greens at almost 12 USD, and the portion was tiiiiny.  Do not accept the peanuts they try to give you when you first sit down. They will charge you. You are given one measly towellete to use. How is this possible when you have to dig in with your hands???  I guess you are paying for the view and location? We were a party of 3 and asked to sit at a table closer to the water but was told it was only for parties of 4 or more. Yet, as we were leaving I noticed a Caucasian party of TWO sitting at the table I asked for. Definitely never coming back. There are a lot more seafood options in the city."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,3,19-Mar-14,"Famous for its chili crab, I naturally had to check it out while in town for business. Unfortunately, while the flavor of the dish was pretty good, it certainly did not merit the market price that I paid ($70). It's a fun dish to eat at first, complete with wet napkins and a bib, but quickly becomes cumbersome and an act of patience.  Service was surprisingly spotty during a slow time, and my table had the luck of being seated directly beneath a tree shortly after it had rained, so my food and self were frequently drizzled on from above. (You'd think it'd add to the scenery, but that turns out to be a romanticized abstraction when spending this much)."

My husband and I aren't the most savvy of chili crab/jumbo seafood orders so we went for the meal for 2 (option A) and let them bring stuff out. The greens, crab, seafood rice and yummy rolls were all amazing. The Desert was a nice surprise too.  Really great, tasty experience and glad we tried the chili crab, we put the sauce on everything!"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,10-Nov-12,"First dinner during my trip to Singapore was at Jumbo Seafood since this has become one my wife's favorite restaurants here.  And this place did not disappoint. They have ample seating both indoors and outdoors, but wait times can be long on busy evenings. Reservations for weekends are recommended.  Service is attentive and with a smile - a good balance of Singapore efficiency (that you see everywhere, including the way trees are planted on sidewalks) and hospitality; the waiters here who make sure you are taken care of without becoming too much in your face!  We ordered the following - Crab with salt ad pepper - if you are a fan of good crabs, I mean really good crabs, and are not afraid to roll up your sleeves and flex your muscles in cracking crab shells, then this dish is for you. Cooked perfectly and great flavors and spices, this dish is a winner. I had to stop myself in sucking on pieces of the shell so as not to look like a hobo! Seafood noodles - well made and the shrimp and squid were cooked perfectly. Had a bit off a kick tho, but I still could not stop eating it. Farmed frogs - One of the best versions of frog legs that I have had ever. The sauce was awesome (pardon my limited repertoire of powerful English words) and stood on its own compared to the crab!  a MUST try seafood restaurant when in Singapore!"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,3,12-Jun-18,"We had to try the famous chili crab that Singapore is known for, so we went to probably the most well-known place in the city (country?) that is known for it. Keep in mind that there is one right across from Clark Quay that we got this location confused with - so we ended up being slightly late for our lunch reservation here. That said, we were able to get a seat inside easily enough, although by the time we had left, the restaurant was quite packed for a weekday lunch. Service was pretty quick and easy, although one of the menu items we wanted was not available despite it being early on in the day...a bit puzzling, but not a dealbreaker. The drink selection has a lot of juices, but the alcoholic selections (beer and wine) are a bit on the light side.  The crabs themselves...they are huge, but they are very tasty as well. For someone who is a bit less experienced at pulling apart seafood, I made an abject mess of it (thankfully, there are wet wipes and plenty of extra napkins provided), but the meat was fresh and infused with the delicious fragrance and taste of red chilis. One could be forgiven for thinking that the crabs were swimming in chili oil before being cooked. Be prepared to fight for the meat, though; it takes a lot of patience, and you have to watch our for the sharper edges on the shell once your hands are slippery from the oil. Outside of that, though, the rest of the meal was very standard-issue Chinese food, and given the premium the restaurant places on the crab, everything else is pretty overpriced in comparison. The fish maw soup I had here was definitely worse than I have had in China (or in Chinatown in NYC), and it was quite a bit more expensive. The mushroom tofu dish we got as our other side was similarly bland and uninspiring, but it set us back nearly S$20 (possibly more).  The crab lives up to the hype, and I would come back just to eat that alone. But the rest of the meal was overpriced mediocrity, to put it bluntly - unfortunately, the magic that comes along with the crab isn't really present on any of the other dishes."

Sure the price is expensive and the wait here can be daunting but with a little bit of planning ahead and an expectation to spend $60-$80 per crab this place is quite all right. The chili crabs are delicious (as judged by me, a possibly misguided foreigner) and the wait can be spent at one of the many bars nearby as they send a text message when the table is ready and wait 5-10 mins for you to arrive if you ask for it.

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,13-Apr-15,"They are well known for 3 dishes here. 1) Chilli Crab 2) Black Pepper Crab 3) Cereal Prawns. We had the Chilli Crab and Black Pepper Crab.  Let me start off by saying that the Chilli crab, especially the sauce is phenomenal. Spicy, tangy, and sweet all at the same time. The crab meat soaks up the sauce and it's just purely delicious. Amongst the best I've had. The Black Pepper crab is delicious as well. The black pepper marinade coats the whole crab. If you're a big black pepper fan like me, you'll love this dish. Some people who aren't black pepper fans aren't too impressed, but I loved it. The Chilli Crab comes served whole (not cut up) while the black pepper crab comes out slightly chopped up. The cereal prawns we didn't get as for only 2 people it's a lot of food, but I've heard they're amazing and it's a must try on my return one day back to Singapore.  So the menu is interesting. They only give you prices on 2 prix fixe options for 2 people they have, both which include Chilli crab and other stuff (appetizer, dessert, etc). We just wanted crab, so we asked about pricing. For 1kg raw it's S$68. You have to ask. Personally I think it was better to get the 2 crabs or the prawns as its what they're known for, and forget the other stuff. The prix fixe options are I believe S$138. Better to get 2 crabs than one of these.  As for the 4 star instead of 5 star review is the service. It's poor to below average at best. For one thing, they put peanuts and wet towelettes on the table and in the menu fine print they're a blurb that there is a charge if consumed. For us Americans who aren't used to this, that's ridiculous. Plus getting service to order food, get refills on water, or just straight napkins was very lackluster. But the food itself is easily a 5 star rating.  Highly recommended to make reservations on their website 24 hours + before going. They are very busy every day. You can standby but it's not reliable. Of course outside seating along the river highly recommended. Very nice ambience."

Of course outside seating along the river highly recommended. Very nice ambience."

However, the waiter that served us who ridiculously careless; forgot to take in our order and also did not apologise. Overall, despite for the service quality, the experiences is pretty nice."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,6-Apr-18,It's a tourist style restaurant but maintain very good quality. Even I lived in Singapore would still like to visit again and again. Famous tourism restaurant can still provide very nice chili crab which is my favorite one in SG. Not too sweet and perfect match with fried mento! And I love black pepper crab as well!

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,20-Nov-14,"I asked as friend who's a local to take us to the best chill crab spot in Sinagpore, and he took us Here. Marcus L and his girlfriend did the ordering and soon we had the plastic bibs on and red chill sauce stained in a glove shape all over our hands.  We ate a lot of great food, my favourite was the crab, though I think when you have such beautiful crab meat it's a shame to cover up its delicate and exquisite taste with an overwhelming chilli sauce, I would have much preferred it just steamed and eaten it cold without any seasoning or sauce, but I think I'm a seafood purist when it comes to crabs.  I also loved the dish which is tiles of cooked fish and prawn paste and topped tightly with a chicken skin. What is the name of this delicious dish?  Jumbo was expensive, even by Perth's extortionate standard, but it's 'the best' and right on the water so I guess that's to be expected.  Book ahead to get a table inside in the air-con!"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,26-Feb-20,Chili crab is excellent!! Their fried rice is one of the most well made fried rice I've ever had. Each grain is perfectly saut¨¦ed and not overly saucily or oily.

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,4-Jan-18,"One of the 2 things people said to do while in Singapore was ""Chili crab!!"". We needed to find the best place to test, to have a thorough opinion, so we poked the brains of every uber/taxi driver and local we could find. We found out everyone has a different opinion. So since we wanted to go to Clark Quey, we decided on the Jumbo at the end so we could walk through the madness afterwards. We ordered the chili crab, malay style noodles, and the little bread balls. Before I state my opinion, I have to say that I am a big fan of crab. I love Than Long, PPQ, Crawstation... and at most places, I can eat the shells clean and usually want to take a straw to the leftover broth, but I was not tempted to ask for a straw here. We were slightly disappointed in the flavor that was so hyped up by our friend. The malay noodles on the other hand...omg must get. The flavor was beautiful. The little bread balls were nice to, not necessarily necessary, but good for soaking up said chili sauce (which is not the same as sipping the broth; the bread just needed something). This location is pretty sweet and we didn't have to wait in line. You might need to sit with other people at a large round table, but it's a cool experience and you can see what other people order. The group to the right of us ordered the king crab legs, and the servers brought out the giant crab ALIVE in a basket so he could meet the people that held his fate in their stomachs before being whisked away to the hot tub. I'd go back and maybe try chili crab at another place...maybe."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,1,24-Feb-17,"If I could give this place negative stars, I would. Although I use Yelp regularly, I never write reviews but this one place was so unbelievably bad, I felt compelled to write my first review. On the one positive side, the seating process is efficient given that the place is run like a factory. On a busy Friday night I was seated within 10 minutes. But sadly this is the only positive thing about the restaurant. The service was appalling! I was the only one at the table who didn't have a place setting and I asked 4 times before I got one. The waitress kept mumbling under her nose. I noticed that none of the dishes on the menu had prices. I ordered one chili crab and a glass of wine. The waitress also brought peanuts and tea. I didn't love the crab but felt good about having tried it as the typical local dish. Then the bill came. It was over $120. The crab was $80 which I thought was ridiculously overpriced. I was also charged for the peanuts and tea I didn't order and also didn't touch. I was appalled. The entire experience was very unpleasant and left a bad taste in my mouth. I recommend you avoid this restaurant."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,1,18-Jan-20,Unfortunately my rating isnt about the food. I never got a chance to try anything. I have never felt so unwanted and disrespected in my life. I took a solo trip to singapore and was really looking forward to trying food from Jumbo. Especially after watching so many videos about it. Needless to say i should have payed attention to the fact only asians were on the videos. I had a 7pm reservation. Not even 2 minutes after being seated i was being rushed to order. I politely asked the waitress for a few minutes to look over the menu. 10 minutes later a new waitress comes and ask for my order. As i am trying to order my food she kept saying "thats too much for you" to everything. I asked aee you speaking of the portions or the price. I was well aware of what i would be spending. I am not a budget traveler. She did not answer and walked off. I payed for my tea with another waitress and walked out.

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,1,13-Dec-16,Extremely deceptive. The guy who took our order tried convincing us to get a more expensive kind of crab. They also gave us tea without asking what we wanted to drink and then charging us for the tea. The service was horrible. Workers there walked around like zombies. We did not have reservations and got seated outside. There were a million little flies flying around landing on our food. The chili crab was nothing to rave about. I would not go back and honestly do not know what the hype is about.

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,13-Mar-13,"During my week long stay in Singapore we came here twice. I had to have more chili crab before I went home to Texas! Service both times was excellent. Now to the important stuff- the food! The chili crab is by far the best thing on the menu. The shells on those crabs are so thick you almost need a small hammer in addition to the cracker. The little fried buns they give you are great to soak up the sauce the crab if floating in. The pepper crab was okay. Peppery. Totally outdone by the chili crab. The egg custard shrimp were delicious. The whole peking duck was wonderful. They prepare the whole thing- bring it table side and then skin it in front of you - Wrapping the bits of crispy skin into crepes with cucumber, green onion and a bit of sauce. Yummy! Then take the duck back and roast it again and bring it to you de-boned and sliced. The seafood fried rice was a bit on the salty side. The venison was very tender, not gamey at all and almost buttery. Both dining experiences were great and I'd say this is a must go - local or tourist :)"

Huge fish tanks in the back where you watch whatever you ordered get taken. Lol maybe it's just my tender heart but I've always had a hard time with that type of display, but moving on. A lot of bareness in regards to decoration etc.  We had a wait but it wasn't bad for dinner on a Saturday night. Once we were seated we went to order. I thought seafood would be easy gluten free but apparently not. I was initially told they couldn't make me anything. When my friend pressed with more questions annoyed at how dismissive the server had been we finally settled that I could have a plain steamed crab with none of the sauces (it was apparently impossible to not put wheat in any of them, even the garlic and olive oil) and the scallops and vegetables plain. My friends ordered other things. The worst part is that all these things came out and I was just sitting there waiting and watching them eat for 45 mins. They finally brought the scallops which everyone ate as well. We then all sat and waited. We had to ask five.. Yes five.. Times about the last crab. Me still starving. We were blown off several times. Asked to speak to a manager twice who never came. Two hours after being seated it finally came and everyone just watched me eat.  Food was good though mine was bland as they offered no sauce options, but seafood was fresh and portions good. They also charge for everything without telling you, the peanuts on the table? Yep. The tea they bring you? Bet ur bottom $  When I return to Singapore I won't be rushing back."

Pepper crab was the worst ive had and it had NO sauce. I asked for sauce and the waiter blatantly refused. We were not even given an apron or cracker for the crab!! I have been a loyal customer of Jumbo since many years and always visit when im in Singapore. But after this visit, I will not be returning here ever!!"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,22-Jan-13,"I usually head to the branch at East Coast Park because eating seafood by the sea adds authenticity to the dining experience (or so I think). It's probably just an unfounded bias that eating seafood next to the sea makes the catch more fresh?! When in reality, I know that the all of the products probably came from the same wholesaler who delivers them to each Jumbo branch. For convenience's sake, you might want to dine at the branch at Riverwalk which is at the heart of Singapore's nightlife - Clark Quay.  My favorite food picks are,  1. Black pepper crab - Order the fried buns (known as ""mantous"") it's sooo good! Then dip it in the black pepper sauce :) - Expect to get your hands super duper dirty! (Definitely not a dish for the first date). They will give you some lime water to clean your hands with after the meal but the crab smell will still linger.  2. Steamed bamboo clam with garlic and vermicelli - Love it! bamboo clams taste like chewy abalone :)  3. Steamed prawns - You'd be surprise how good these prawns are even without any seasoning! They usually serve you some soya sauce with slices of red chili to dip the prawns.   4. Fried you tiao stuff with fish cake - Honestly, I did not expect to be a fan of this dish because ""you tiaos"" (fried dough strips) are sooo oily but the ones at Jumbo are crispy and golden. The fish cake inside makes it even more flavorful and savory! Perfect combination.  Ambiance: Jumbo's restaurant (outdoor seating area) is overlooking the beautiful Singapore river so you get a good view of Singpore's old port (now a tourist hotspot for boat cruises). I would recommend Jumbo over the boat cruise any day!"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,3,11-Oct-13,"CHILI CRAB. Mmmm...  Being in Singapore, the one dish you cannot leave without trying is chili crab. So when I finally received my last paycheck for my summer internship there, I decided to splurge on Singapore's speciality, after hearing from my coworkers that Jumbo had the best/most famous chili crab to offer.  Maybe it's the fact that I'm young, or the fact that I'm a girl and sometimes don't need to pay for my meals, but ""splurge"" in my book was clearly not the ""splurging"" I had intended to do. I ended up dropping more than $60 on my meal. And I had split my bill with my roommate, who was also sitting in disbelief that the two of us would consume $120 worth of chili crab. In my opinion, this restaurant was way overpriced, which, along with the marginally acceptable service, is the main reason why I only gave it three stars.  Mind you, the crab itself was very delicious. The chili is a tomato based sauce, so it was sweet and not overwhelming, and tastes delicious with the fried buns. I might say that their other dishes are quite good too--if you can get over the fact that a plate of veggies and tofu would cost you $35. This also might sound pretty petty, but at first I was pleased that the server poured us tea and served us peanuts... until I saw that the two showed up on my bill at the end. Why would I pay to eat a small dish of peanuts at a seafood restaurant. Especially when my server disappeared for the vast majority of the night, even when I wanted a refill of said overpriced tea and/or peanuts.  However, the ambience itself is quite nice--the restaurant looks nice, and sits right in the center of Clarke Quay (read: tourist central), so you can get a nice view of the Singapore River and the thousands of people passing by and jealously watching you eat seafood. This restaurant is extremely crowded, however, things should be okay if you make reservations more than a week in advance.  I highly doubt anyone but tourists and birthday celebrators eat at this restaurant, but being a tourist myself, it's fair to say that this restaurant's signature dish definitely left a lasting impression."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,26-Aug-13,"First Yelp review in Singapore!!  Everyone tells me that I have to try the chili crab when in Singapore so when the opportunity came along (friend I met during this trip wanted to go to this place to celebrate her birthday) I was totally down for it and I'm so glad she invited me. There were five of us and we ordered two crabs, one chili and one black pepper. we also ordered some noodles and veggie plate.  I shared the ginormous chili crab with the birthday gal and oi was it delicious! the sauce was amazing! I thought it was going to be super spicy but it wasn't. The sauce was just perfect - spicy but not so spicy that it feels like your tongue is on fire...as a matter of fact it was very flavorful. You can enjoy both the spiciness and flavor - what's more amazing is if you dipped the bread into the sauce or even put a few spoons onto the noodles. The crab, itself was fresh and meaty.  We each paid about 35 dollars...which isn't too bad honestly. I consider it pretty cheap. I would definitely want to try the pepper crab next time since this time I didn't really get to try it."

In MY opinion Jumbos is always consistently good. They have a decent menu and you can definitely find something for everyone. I love the mocha pork ribs. One of the reasons I really like jumbos is also because you can get the cereal prawns deshelled. I'm sorry but I'm a white guy and I dont like durian and I dont like prawns with the shell on. I find the chili crab sauce here to be a tad bit sweeter. There are other spots that have bigger crabs but I think all around with the food, crab options and different branches all over its a pretty safe bet.  In terms of this branch there is ALWAYS a wait. If youre calling for reservations the same day for dinner forget it. Otherwise you'll be eating at 10pm. The service is not friendly but its there. If youre a live here and you and your friends are ALWAYS taking friends/visitors to chili crab sign up for the jumbo membership:)"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,4-Aug-13,"I ate here twice in July 2013.  I had the pepper crab the first time and the chili crab the second time. I FAR preferred the pepper crab, it is traditional Singapore-style in simple pepper broth, not a sweat creamy sauce like you sometimes see with this dish. The chili crab, I found the sauce to be too ""gooey"", not for me, to each his own.  I also ordered other items like Mee Goreng noodles, VERY good and spicy. The seafood fried rice was also very good.  Overall the service was fast and typical for a place like this. Surprisingly, they have some good white wines that pair very well with the spicy dishes.

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,12,"Seafood, Singaporean",4,4-Aug-13,"I ate here twice in July 2013.  I had the pepper crab the first time and the chili crab the second time. I FAR preferred the pepper crab, it is traditional Singapore-style in simple pepper broth, not a sweat creamy sauce like you sometimes see with this dish. The chili crab, I found the sauce to be too ""gooey"", not for me, to each his own.  I also ordered other items like Mee Goreng noodles, VERY good and spicy. The seafood fried rice was also very good.  Overall the service was fast and typical for a place like this. Surprisingly, they have some good white wines that pair very well with the spicy dishes.

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,22-Nov-17,One of the messiest dinners ever! But so so worth it!! That tomato based yummy spicy broth the crab is in gets tastier as you sop up some mini buns with it!!! Pricey? Yep. A must do and unique taste in Singapore for sure!

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,6-Jan-15,Couldn't go to Singapore without trying the Chili Crab at a Jumbo Seafood. Never had this dish before. Hard to eat (like most crab) but worth the effort. Be sure to order more buns than you think you can eat because you'll need them to sop up all the delicious juice. All the side dishes were great. Well worth the 40 minute Uber ride from the St. Regis!  If it's a rainy night try to get a table in the covered area since it gets a little crazy for the people outside when the rain comes.

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,9-Nov-14,"Finally came to this place for her legendary Chilli Crab. I was very impressed and felt my trip and money worthwhile. I had a 1Kg Chilli Crab(S$68), and it came out perfect. In fact, just nice, not too much and not too little. I did not have the Alaska Live Crab because I did not fly 8000 miles from SFO for Live Alaska Crab. There are tons of it in SFO's Fisherman's wharf. Just regretting for ordering rice(S$0.80) which I didn't even touch. And the peanuts and the tea were a waste too because I didn't touch those too. BTW, they do charge for the tiny cup(S$1.20) of tea which is refillable and the peanuts(S$1.20). Must come back for more in the near future."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,2,26-Sep-13,"Way over-priced place that is tourist central, I'm guessing because lonely planet recommended it. The chilli crab was pretty good, but again, expensive. And what really put a damper on the experience is how they serve you peanuts and walk around pouring you green tea like it's complimentary, and then it shows up on your bill! Pretty shameless. As long as tourists keep coming, they can get away with these practices. I highly doubt any locals are eating here."

As I said, ""Classy"" is a tag on everything in Jumbo Seafood. If fulfills all the western fantasy of an eastern country, with Jade Tofu, 10cm-long razor clams, the iridescent reflection on the Singapore River, the fish-eyed twakow boats, and the numerous modern skyscrapers.  Try it! Ignore the price tag!"

We were walk ins but were able to get a table after which was great. Sadly, after looking at the menu we had to leave because they serve shark fin soup and we can not support the inhumane, unnecessary, and unsustainable killing of sharks just to texturize soup. Please reconsider serving this product before sharks go extinct over it. Thank you for your consideration."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,23-Sep-12,"Last week I was down from Tokyo, where I live, in Singapore for a tradeshow. This was the third time this year that I've been to Jumbo and again it lived up to the billing. My pal Sophia, my go-to Singapore Foodie says Jumbo is the place to go for crab and when it comes to food in Singapore, what Sophia says goes!  There were a group of 12 of us, thirsty from chatting with customers all day and ready to drain some Tiger beer and murder some crab. We started with some appetizers including some great river shrimp. The chili crab was the first to come-as the other reviewer said, the mantou buns are a must, for mopping up the extra sauce, of which there's plenty. We also got some veggie dishes and noodles to keep the crab company, but I was waiting for his brother to make an appearance. Finally the pepper crab came-also awesome! Whereas the chili crab has an ebi-chili sweetness about it, the pepper crab lives up to its name an has a peppery after-kick. Good thing I cut my nails the day before-Singapore crab, like sand at the beach, gets everywhere, and it was nice not to have to dig it out, per prior visits.  The riverside branch of the restaurant was bustling, as always, and we sat outside, as always. great people watching and the river after dark feels cool-the icy Tiger helped. Bill for a dozen, eating and drinking reasonably but not leaving hungry, was SIN $600-ish, pretty reasonable by business dinner standards, compared to North America US or Western Europe. It's F1 this weekend, so the place is probably packed-reservations advised even after the show moves on. It's popular with locals, expats and tourists alike. There are six locations to choose from. Enjoy!"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,4,7-Dec-12,"I've been here a few times just as a family and with guests from out of town. I never remember to get a reservation, so I just show up early and see what's available. Luckily, with a small group you can usually get a table if you agree to leave within about 1.5 hours or so.  I've had a few dishes here. Of course, chilli crab is a must, and it's very good. The sauce is hot but really flavorful. It's not quite as great of a chilli sauce as the Seafood International out by East Coast Park, but still good. A perfect dish is the fried 'mantou' (buns); excellent dipped in the chilli sauce. The slightly-sweet breadiness helps to cut the spice. We usually get a couple of veg dishes, too, which are pretty standard. The cereal prawns are not bad, but since then I've gotten just salt and pepper prawns instead.  All in all, I will still come here if I'm meeting people in the downtown area. Reliably good and not so overpriced."

They did put a 75 min time limit on my meal, which was a first but something I actually found very efficient! Service was excellent -- I received constant attention. I'm still getting used to the lack of napkins in Singapore, so that was an adjustment -- Bibb, plastic gloves, finger bowls and wet wipes, but no napkins for a very messy meal. With nothing to compare it to, the crab was just OK. I enjoyed it, but it didn't blow my mind and leave me salivating to return (though perhaps Chili Crab in general just isn't tasty enough for me to yearn for it, especially at the price -- which was very comparative for chili crab in Singapore). Glad I had the experience, but I'm not rushing back."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,3,2-Jan-13,"For full review with pics: http://princessandangmoheatsg.blogspot.sg/2013/01/jumbo-seafood-riverwalk.html  Came here one might for a friend's going away party. Got lucky and was sent to a table instantly, rather than the party ahead of us who had to wait 45 mins.  This jumbo seafood restaurant is at Riverwalk, across from Clark Quay and on the water still. This night we got a table outside but still under cover, the rain had just stopped also.  Since we had a few other people in our party, we ordered a bit more food than usual and it turned out to be just enough.  The black pepper crab was the single best item ordered. The crabs overall seemed a bit small compared to Spring Court but not bad still. The chili crab was OK but the sauce was a bit thin and definitely not as good as East Coast or Spring Court.  The fried buns were delicious as always (but are these ever bad? anywhere??), the kang kong tasted the same and the fried rice was good too, nothing especially good though.  An enjoyable meal overall but not the best of anything."
Jumbo Seafood,3.8,12,"Seafood, Singaporean",3,2-Jan-13,"For full review with pics: http://princessandangmoheatsg.blogspot.sg/2013/01/jumbo-seafood-riverwalk.html  Came here one might for a friend's going away party. Got lucky and was sent to a table instantly, rather than the party ahead of us who had to wait 45 mins.  This jumbo seafood restaurant is at Riverwalk, across from Clark Quay and on the water still. This night we got a table outside but still under cover, the rain had just stopped also.  Since we had a few other people in our party, we ordered a bit more food than usual and it turned out to be just enough.  The black pepper crab was the single best item ordered. The crabs overall seemed a bit small compared to Spring Court but not bad still. The chili crab was OK but the sauce was a bit thin and definitely not as good as East Coast or Spring Court.  The fried buns were delicious as always (but are these ever bad? anywhere??), the kang kong tasted the same and the fried rice was good too, nothing especially good though.  An enjoyable meal overall but not the best of anything."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,1,25-Mar-15,They charge for everything even the peanuts that is already on the table. Why? It's not like we ordered it. We ordered set A which included this duck salad which we couldn't eat. Total bill was 166$ for 2 people which is awfully expensive for below standard service and food. I honestly absolutely love crab and was SO excited to try this place and was SO disappointed.

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,4-Jan-15,"I asked the concierge at my hotel where to find the best place for chili crab and he said hands down, it's Jumbo Seafood in Clarke Quay. I gave it a go and it was amazing! The crab was tender and in this great tasty gravy that I wanted to gulp down after all the crab was gone. It being Chili Sauce, you would assume it's spicy, but it wasn't. It was just a flavorful goodness. I would definitely go back!"

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,5,3-Nov-14,"What can I say. This is the place to go for chilli crab, black / white pepper crab / egg yolk crab which I categorise as ""die die must eat"" hahaha....If you have enough people to share, I suggest you to order a bigger size (i.e. 1.5 kg), which the claw is more like a piece of steak and is much more fulfilling...sometimes sharing a 900g crab by 2 is not so enough. In that case I usually end up coming again before I take off back to HK...There are 2 Jumbos around Clarke Quay - One is right at the river side which is more open and the view is better, good to go with client / foreigners. The other one is at this Upper Circular Road which is indoor and it is less crowded in terms of seating but usually serves 3 rounds everyday (6:00 - 7:30, 7:30 - 9:00, 9:00 onward). However we were not being kicked out at 9pm and stay there till the end.....Anyway both serve the same food with same high standard. Booking is needed."

Jumbo Seafood,3.8,216,Seafood,2,26-Jun-14,"Very good food, however the only let down is that they try to rip you off. My wife and I ordered the Singaporean chili crab. When ordering, the waitress said that the only crab they have available was a 1.5kg crab. Having told that this crab is 'finger licking' tasting, hence I didn't hesitate with a 1.5kg crab. When the food came out, I noticed that the crab looked unusual. The shell was only the size of my Samsung galaxy and pieces were mixed from other crab. The texture of the meats of each pieces and even the sizes of each legs did not match what I was expecting from a 1.5kg crab. I asked the waitress, which she denied and tried to brush it off. I felt that I was ripped off for paying for a 1.5kg crab which it was only a mixture of different sized crabs. Apart from that, the taste was excellent."

I was able to secure a table for two on the same day for an early dinner (5:45PM) and when I arrived, they informed me I would have to give up my table at 7:00PM. It really puts me off when restaurants restrict the amount of time you are allowed to stay for a meal. Luckily, the food came quick after we placed our order. Nonetheless, the meal was worth it. The chili crab was delicious. The sauce... wow... I wish I could bottle the sauce and bring it home to drizzle over my rice every day. Finger-licking good! With the seafood fried rice, it was a lot of food for two people. I suggest coming here with a larger group so you can try a variety of dishes. Would have given it 5 stars had I not been rushed!"

You know immediately they do a good job on their special dumplings - Xiao Long Bao. The restaurant is at orchard road. Most of the wait time is about 20 minutes. I waited only 17 minutes.  As usual, I order the crab Xiao Long Bao. It is soupy and crab egg in it. Very good. The soup here is better than my previous two other locations. I got the shrimp dumplings. It is half moon shape. The only thing I would said is good.  Finally I have try one of their specialty. The black truffle Xiao Long Bao. It is rare item. Each piece cost $5 SG. The make of this dumplings is with black truffle. It doe carry plenty soup it it. It has great taste.  The food come out quick. Service to the table is attentive. I would said is a way to move the customer to create space for the people who waited."

We sat down and were promptly served two orders of Xiao Long Bao and felt pacified as the soup explosion in my mouth placed me in a state foodie hypnosis.  And that was just the regular order. We then order the one with truffle flavoring and I felt like Buddha must felt when he found himself in reclining position as he attained Nirvana.  Seriously, I really enjoyed the quality here and feel as if I have cheated the entire state of California whole will wait another 2 hours before they can sit down and have about 70% of the quality of XLB that are here.  We also had the drunken chicken: simple and excellent.  Then for a refreshment, I had the grass jelly drink. Perfect.  Then we had a mushroom and minced pork with noodle dish. Simple and perfect.

Think I ever mentioned in my other post, I do not like to stand in line, period!  Staffs were all friendly and attentive. I like that the restaurant has those bag holders/stands, like those in Taste Paradise, which allow female customers to store their purses or bags. Of cos those at Taste Paradise were a lot better since they came with a flap attached to secure the top. The ones at Din Tai Feng were open bag holders which the staff would just put a cloth over it. Ok I know, I can be so nitpicking.  FOOD 4/5 The legendary xiao long bao (steamed dumplings) were yummy as expected. I also ordered one red bean bun and one meat bun just to try. They were tiny but were good.  AMBIENCE 3/5 It was noisy but I did not expect it to be calm and quiet. It was not a place I would suggest for a first date. More like a place for friends to catch up or family lunch.  STAFFS 5/5 Staffs were attentive, helpful and polite. Water was filled up constantly."

Din Tai Fung,4.2,68,"Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Dumplings",5,3-Nov-17,"How can everything here be so delicious? I think I had dim sum approximately four times during my one-week trip to Singapore and this was definitely the best of all of them.  We didn't have to wait too long to get seated, and we were able to decide on what to order while we waited so our food was ready very quickly once we sat down. I honestly don't remember everything we had; I just ate and felt happy. There were a couple highlights though:  - Xiaolongbao: delicious. I've often had xlb where the soup has leaked out by the time you eat it all. Not the case here. Full of soup, perfectly complemented by the ginger and vinegar. - Truffle xiaolongbao: If you like super strong truffle flavor, you could probably eat many of these. I could only eat one but it felt like the most decadent xlb I've ever had. - Chili crab bun: What's not to love? Chili crab combined with the fluffiest bun...heavenly. - Fried rice: I could have eaten the whole plate. Enough said. - Chocolate/red bean dumpling: I have never tried a dessert dumpling before, and I was a little skeptical of chocolate and red bean combined in a dumpling. But it was delicious. The flavors match really well and the chocolate is so nice and melty. Be sure to save room for this.  Din Tai Fung really is the best and it lives up to the hype."

It was well worth the wait and when I found out that there are locations all over Singapore, I had to make a visit.  This location is located on the top floor of the Wisma Atria which was super easy to get to from the Grand Hyatt where we were staying. I was delighted when we didn't have to wait at all and were seated immediately. They even set a carrier next to our table for all of our packages from shopping. I liked that a lot!  I ordered the braised beef noodles and pork xlb which was what I had ordered in Seattle. Everything was delicious. I love that the xlb is consistent and still amazing no matter where you go to in the world. I did notice that the braised beef in my noodles was a lot more fatty that the meat pieces in Seattle. Perhaps it's the geographical preference.  Another thing I noticed was my friend and I were practically the only Asian people in the restaurants making me think there are probably many xlb restaurants that give DTF a run for their money. But no matter, love the xlb here and had a great lunch."

Din Tai Fung,4.2,68,"Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Dumplings",4,18-Jan-17,Andrew and I always wondered how Din Tai Fung (DTF) can consistently keep their rich flavour after opening many branches around the world. We visited a few Din Tai Fung restaurants when we were in Singapore and were blown away at their good quality control. At the same time we also thought that we were just lucky... ;-)  Two things that we always ordered in Din Tai Fung were their shrimp & pork shao mai and of course the 18 folds original Xiao Long Bao. DTF's xiao long bao is really in the league of their own. Honestly we never found any broken dumpling skin although I never really counted the number of folds on their dumpling.  The shao mai was also always very delicious with plenty of pork meats inside. I always add vinegar to shao mai and the xiao long bao as I love the additional sour flavour on the meat. Of course the price of their dishes are more than the other Chinese restaurants but the quality never disappoints us.

I was at Orchard Road with my mother, and we had entered one of the shopping malls to purchase some stuff from Lush and by the time the shopping was done, it was closing on 9pm, and we both were just super hungry. I had noticed a food court level located in the same mall as the Lust store, so just took the elevetor up there and then looked at Yelp reviews and this one come up tops.  Honestly, it wasn't a great first experience as when we approached the restaurant front of staff and asked about vegetarian options for my mother, the lady said there was nothing vegetarian available. But I asked to see menu and there _clearly_ were veg options that mum said she was interested in trying. So we got in and soon afterwards folks were turned away as the restaurant was closing at 10pm.  We hurriedly ordered pretty much at random from the menu to be honest (and the list of foods ordered is in my photos), but gosh, all the food we got was so good and scrumptious, each bite was a delight and I walked away super happy to have had the opportunity/ chance to eat here (sometimes the food gods are truly with you!) My one regret however was that in rush of ordering, didn't get to try the XLB so am going to make it my mission once back in US next year, to get myself to a DTF and try this (#foodie 2016 new year resolution!)"

Having exposed ourselves exploring Singapore under extreme heat, we couldn't help but finding ourselves dining in a cool AC top-notch restaurant like Ding Tai Fung. This Taiwanese establishment is located right in the heart of Orchard area. Famously known for its Xiao Long Bao, Ding Tai Fung also features a bunch of other dimsum goodness, which we were determined to try them all out.  We started with a refreshing dish of Oriental salad. The salad was crunchy and delicious, with standout ingredients like bean sprouts, Korean glass noodles and vinegar, which we believe is a perfect match to create the appetite since vinegar dressing salad is our favorite. Afterwards, here came our Steamed Pork Dumplings (Xiao Long Bao), Steamed Shrimp & Pork Shaomai, Steamed Vegetable & Pork Buns, and Steamed Finely Mashed Red Bean Dumplings. Of course, the spotlight should be given Xiao Long Bao. Sipping the water inside each bao is wonderful. The inside meat is well-flavored.  Recommendation: Xiao Long Bao, Oriental Salad  Read our full review at: http://www.thecoupleeats.com/singapore-food-diary-7-places-eat-first-time-visitors/"

In the US, two hour waits can be the norm, but there are just too many good food options here in Singapore.  This Din Tai Fung was conveniently located in the Wisma Atria mall on there 4th floor (by the way, another incredible food court on this level as well), and was right across the street from our hotel. Wanting to see how it compares to the one in Bellevue, WA, we had an early lunch here. We ordered:  Seaweed salad and tofu with honey sauce appetizers: both were good. I had the seaweed salad before, but the tofu dish was new to me: nice way to start the meal.  Fried shrimp pancake: this was new to me as well, and was my favorite dish. Love how crispy and not greasy it was.  Shrimp fried rice: standard but good.  Shrimp and Chinese gourd dumplings: just ok: not that big of a fan of the gourd.  Chili crab bun: this was really good, but you order them one each (should have gotten another one).  Overall, very similar to the Din Tai Fung's in the US. No wait to be seated, but we did have a long wait for our food, though."

Instead of setting a portrait of my spouse on my bedside table when I travel to Singapore, I will be placing the business card from Din Tai Fung, which features a picture of a plump xiao long bao, on the table next to my bed.  Soft, juicy pillows of steaming xiao long bao whispered delicious pork nothings to me last night during my first visit to the Orchard branch of Din Tai Fung, how could I have been so blind to this love affair in the making?  What is so amazing about Din Tai Fung is that it is a large chain restaurant by the BreadTalk group, a type of business that I would never or rarely patronize, but the quality was simply decadent. The service was average to nearly poor, however, the food was so spectacular, the rating could be nothing less than than a five star."

Even went to the original so when we had this opportunity, we jumped at it. After we arrived, we were seated right away. We ordered items we usually order and the first item the Cucumber Appetizer, it was served cut lengthwise, and had an odd sauce and odd taste. The food in general was just OK and the service was slow and inattentive. Left the restaurant disappointed which never happens. If this had been my first experience i would most likely never go back."

The Pork Chop Fried Rice, Steamed garlic Spinach, Noodles with Spicy Sauce, Stuffed chillis, the DTF salad and of course, their Xiao Long Bao are all to die for. There's a lot more on the menu to choose from but those are my favourites.  The waiting time can be long if you're going during the peak hours, but that's normal for any DTF in the city. The system they have keeps everything going smoothly and if you do have to wait long, it'll be worth it.  The only thing that is annoying; and it seems to a problem at all of their outlets, is that most of the people working there don't speak English well. In Singapore, this should be a necessity. However, with the way ordering works, you really don't need to speak to the staff other than when you need to pay.  Everyone I've taken to Din Tai Fung has loved it.  ...and I can't imagine why you wouldn't!"

Tantalizingly juicy dumplings, fast service and rich noodles.

I've been to multiple locations in Singapore (my hometown), the Seattle location and the very first franchise in Taiwan. Each one is slightly different, but despite the subtle differences all of them are nothing short of amazing!!  Although the prices are slightly expensive the amount of food you get is worth the price. Everything on their menu is delectable! I could eat here for every meal!

Din Tai Fung,4.2,68,"Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Dumplings",5,29-Nov-12,"A famous Taiwanese chain restaurant specializing in steamed dumplings, which are made to order. You can tell since they have an open window to the kitchen with a bunch of chefs rolling dough and stuffing dumplings. Behind them are stacks of bamboo dished sitting on top of a large steam generator. We chose to go to this branch (located in the Wisma Atria Food Republic) for lunch during our last day in Singapore before returning home. Overall, great food and decent service.  The Xiao Long Bao were probably our favorite - basically these are small pork dumplings that are filled with a little bit of hot broth (as in temperature hot). You dip them in vinegar and eat them with extreme caution. I usually put an entire one in my mouth, and carefully chew off the edge, which causes some of the broth the seep out. I then proceed to eat the rest of the juicy dumpling. The temperature was just right - hot but not scalding. Bite into one of these things too quickly and you can run the risk of burning the inside of your mouth with a jet of hot soup! (No wonder they're translated to Little Dragon Buns).  The Spicy Pork Dumplings in Red Chili Oil is another Taiwanese classic, and they make it good here as well. Very smooth dumpling skins with the right amout of spice.  The Braided Beef Noodles is good enough to share with two people - very tender and juicy brisket and chewy noodles.  For dessert, we had three little Black Sesame buns. The outside was white and smooth, but the insiders were filled with lots of black sesame paste that was sweet and offered a grainy texture to contrast with the outer bun. Very tasty and a good way to end the email.  Being a famous chain restuarant, prices are generally higher than what you can get at the stalls in the Food Republic. Still, this is a good place to go to if you're craving dumplings and want a quieter meal with your own table. The various other menu offerings (noodle stoups, sauteed veggies, traditional Chinese dishes) are also good if dumplings aren't your thing."

Din Tai Fung,4.2,68,"Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Dumplings",3,14-Jan-16,"I had heard so much about Din Tai Fung that I was in a crazy pursuit after these bloody dumplings - never making it, until tonight.  First off, staff is very nice, mostly.  We arrived an hour before closing time. Before being able to order, we were told which dumplings they had run out of. My husband does not eat meat so it wasn't nice to hear that all of the fish dumplings and most of the vegetarian options were gone. But then again we were late.  So we ordered a concoction of food that was mostly noodles and veggies, and 6 pieces of crab meat & pork dumplings (for me). The order was placed shortly after 9 pm.  Everyone around us seemed to be getting food (the place was relatively empty though) fast.  Our first order arrived at around 9:35, everything else in about 5-minute-iterations, with a staff member asking us at 9:30 if we wanted to place a last order - which was a tad bizarre, with no other food having arrived yet. Also we had the dumpling-delivery-people stopping by our table often - only to carry on walking again after checking the contents - pretty funny, if you are NOT hungry that is.  We finally had nearly all of our food (following a dumpling mix-up), when I was asked to pay and come to the till - where I had to wait for someone else to pay.  Back to my- nearly cold - food, the last order arrived: the crab meat & pork dumplings, with samples of black hair. I stopped a waiter who immediately offered a replacement. That took some time, which made the whole experience very late - with the supervisor apologising profusely, for both the wait and the hair situation.  All in all, food was just ok. Pretty bland.  Two stars for the wait staff, one for food.  I guess we just hit a bad day but I won't be back, especially since my husband found that there is a huge difference in quality between here and Taipei. Taipei it shall be then, next time :-)"

It's amazing how consistent DTFs are across the world. We had to wait about 20 mins to be seated at this Paragon basement DTF, but again, consistently good food and quick no-nonsense service. They have it down to a science."

Diners mark selections on a clipboard either while waiting for a table or immediately when seated.  We go about once a month, all the locations are pretty consistent and we often tend to order the same things on each visit. Sliced Cucumbers with Garlic, Xiao Long Bao, Shrimp and Pork Dumplings, Shrimp and Pork Shumai, Pork Buns, Fried Rice with Fried Pork Chop, Wontons with Vinegar and Chili Oil are all extremely good.  There is often a wait for a table so the trick is to arrive early before the peak rush. They open an hour earlier at 10am on weekends. Din Tai Fung is a great place to bring out of town visitors for dim sum. Even the most constipated westerner will find this food appealing."

Nobody makes xiao long bao as delicately as they do - it's practically an art form. I also love their hot & sour soup, which has fantastically thinly-sliced veggies (I hate when I get huge chunks that steal the show and prefer when all the flavors blend as they do with this dish). I've tried a bunch of their other dumplings, all of which were good in their own right, but I can't come here without ordering at least one tray of XLB. You've got to too!  This place is wildly popular and there's almost always a line, so be prepared for a slight wait (usually 20 mins, but sometimes longer depending on your party size + time of day + day of week). It's my favorite location because of the openness you feel with the glass walls and the efficiency of the service.

I haven't had any better, and after visiting even the other branches of this store, I don't think I will. Maybe the hands here are magic after all.

At our local Din Tai Fung in California, it is impossible to get a reservation and the wait time is always more than one hour if you are lucky. The XLB are scrumptious. Best XLB around!!

Din Tai Fung,4.2,68,"Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Dumplings",5,24-Oct-14,"Probably one of my favorite restaurant with great confidence. Every branch of Din Tai Fung in the world exhibits consistency in the quality, quantity of food as can be found in their flagship store originated in Taiwan. This alone in terms of quality control impressed me. It is not pricey at all for the consistency and quality of food delivered.  Though there may be a tiny adjustments to local taste buds the dishes largely stay true to it's origin and how it was first delivered in Taiwan. However it is still quite an ""international"" flavor than to say it is a true Taiwanese local flavor.  It's like eating in the actual Taiwan branch, but in Singapore!"

Din Tai Fung,4.2,68,"Shanghainese, Taiwanese, Dumplings",5,26-Jun-13,"My parents and I stumbled upon Din Tai Fung after a long day of walking and window-shopping. We were really hungry and decided to try out this restaurant. I've came across Din Tai Fung many times when shopping at Level 4. However, my mom and I never tried the restaurant because the waiting queue is usually really long. It was not until my dad said that Din Tai Fung is a really good restaurant from Taiwan and encouraged us to try it that we finally had dinner there.  The food is delicious! You have to try the xiao long bao (juicy pork dumplings) there, or you'll be missing out! It's the juiciest, most delicious dumplings I've ever had. What special about xiao long bao is that there is a little bit of soup inside the dumplings. Dip the dumpling inside soy sauce and vinegar, add a little bit of the ginger (yes you'll be missing out too if you don't eat it with ginger), and it will simply melt in your mouth. We ordered several other dishes, such as pork shop fried rice, shaomai, bean sauced noodle, drunken chicken, and tofu appetizer. They're all delicious. I also love the refreshing dried longan drink. I was looking for it at Din Tai Fung in Arcadia, California, but unfortunately they don't have it there :(.  Since then, whenever we visit Singapore, we always come to Din Tai Fung. The food is definitely worth the long wait. Besides, there are a few shops around that you could go to while waiting for your number to be called. The kitchen is also see-through, if you want to see how the dumplings are made. Personally, I prefer this Din Tai Fung more than the ones in California because there are more choices available, especially the longan drink (although my favorite Din Tai Fung has to be the one in Taiwan)."

This place can get crowded, so i recommend that you get a queue number early. No reservations unfortunately.  For those who are not familiar with asian food, I recommend that your group orders a number of dishes and shares everything (asian way) rather than each person ordering your own dishes.

My friend asked to meet at this one because it's the ""nicer"" one in Singapore. I can see why, it's nicely located in the ritzy Orchard District, located on the lower level of the Wisma Atria Shopping Center. We came for Saturday dinner, and it was packed, but we only had to wait 10 minutes. The people were pleasant, and the service was great! I didn't know this before, but they also provide little rolly baskets for people to put their personal items in next to their tables, which is then covered by a blanket. Such a nice touch instead of having to hang your stuff behind your chair or putting it on the table.  The food at DTF is always on point and consistent. Of course we ordered the xiaolongbao's--both salty and sweet version. I personally am a fan of salty xiaolongbao's, but the taro xiaolongbao is good for those with a sweet tooth! Hot and sour soup was very nice, and I usually never order that! Basicaly, you can't go wrong with anything you order here, so go nuts!  After your dinner, feel free to walk around the huge shopping center, and it's central to everything so you can really enjoy your day here! DTF is a solid place to go!"

The soup was okay, not as flavorful as I was hoping.....edible after adding some vinager & spice.  Our favorites were the chili crab buns and dumplings. The service was attentive and efficient. The only complaint was Jasmine tea was brought to the table without requesting it, so we thought it was complimentary. Upon checking the bill, we were charged $1.00/person......not a huge deal, but at least ask the customer if it is wanted. Other than that, a very pleasant, affordable meal."

If I'm dining alone, I like their fried rice - the one with the pork cutlet on top is very good. I also like their Oriental Wantons in Black Vinegar and Chilli Oil. I've tried their duo miao and their pancake stuff, all pretty decent. The other dumplings aren't really as good, so I would stick to the traditional ones. If you're looking for a truly Asian experience, a friend told me the proper wait to eat these dumplings are to dab some black vinegar on using the ginger provided, bite off the top of the dumpling, sip the soup, and then put the rest of the dumpling in your mouth.  All in all, the food is excellent and tasty. My only complaint would be on the service. There was once I asked for a bit more sauce as I prefer my items a bit on the ""wet"" side, but was told by the waiter that I couldn't have it. When I insisted that another outlet had allowed me to do it, it had to escalate to a manager level where although I was given more sauce, I was told in a very ""you-better-don't-ask-again-tone"" that they are making an exception and that I should not ask for things out of the ordinary the next time.

Who knew three Chinese words can make a difference. This eatery "meats" the world standard of all restaurants in the world. All the items that make the restaurant famous are here. I really enjoyed the xiao long bao as well. Who knew I would find it at a better quality than any other dim sum place in the US and Singapore. This Din Tai Fung is bigger than any other ones in the US. Cannot wait until they open up the one in Valley Fair Mall. Only problem was that a dinner here is considered really expensive. It is a good splurge.

The meals are hot and arrive relatively quickly and they look well presented. But the problem with DTF in Singapore is they do not have a strong sense of the kind of flavors expected of steamed soup dumplings and even the Red Roast Beef Noodles are merely OK in flavor. It needs a lot more of that OOMPH and rarely delivers.

Minang House,4.8,4,Indonesian,4,4-Mar-20,"When I lived across the street temporarily a few years back, I would stop by here every so often and was always happy when I left. Whether it's your first meal of the day, grabbing a snack, or dropping into Lucky Plaza to escape the heat, Nasi Minang is a great place to visit. The aunties are always so sweet and kind, and especially patient with my slow selection process. The place is nothing fancy but the food has that home cooked quality to it. Aunty says her spiciness level is 1/2 of other places.  The selection is pretty varied but the chickens here are the best. Fried chicken offered in different blends of spices - green, red, rendang, plain, ... there's gotta be something you like. Fish also available, but the chicken is the star. Pick your side dishes and a drink, and your set for a yummy time."
Minang House,4.8,4,Indonesian,5,1-Apr-16,"Yeah they deserve perfect 5 stars 3x in a row. I am really surprised that the food is goddamn authentic here. The restaurant is pretty tiny and basic but that alone enhances your entire eating experience! I've been here twice and the food quality is always consistent! Everything is much better than Sari Ratu which is another Indonesian Nasi Padang restaurant next door that's much more expensive (sure sari ratu has a better ambiance and deco but taste & price wise don't make the cut). So here I've tried:  Food: Spinach with carrot (simple, tasty and clean taste)  Kangkong (a little spicy and delicious)  Roasted chicken (very tender meat, very flavorful seasoning and not dry at all although I had breast)  Poached fish with tomato based sauce (extremely delicious soup base which goes really well with the fish)  Indo style chicken soup (OMG soooo tasty and hearty, like something your grandma would make for you, the best asian chicken soup really! I could taste a lot of herbs and seasonings that get along really well in the soup altogether)  The staff gave me extra curry sauce with coconut milk based Indo style of course to pour it on the rice for extra kick (apparently that's what the real Indonesians do at Padang restaurant).  Everything is just very very delicious and on point, but, what keeps me coming back is the fried sambal with tomato and chili, it looks pretty oily but soooooo soooo gooooood and the padang resto next door doesn't have it! Probably because it's tedious to make that's why it's sooo gooooood.  I believe you have to ask personally for the sambal that you want because there are 2-3 types there. It's not too spicy as well because I usually don't eat spicy stuff but when I do, it'd only be here!  Drinks: Teh Botol; Famous and tasty Indonesian bottled jasmine tea which is quite sweet if you drink straight off the bottle but I always get mine on the rock.  Such a gem!!!!! Cheap, authentic & really good! They close at 8:30pm."
Minang House,4.8,4,Indonesian,5,19-Jul-13,"First time my friend brought me here, I was like how the heck I have not known this place earlier...  I have come here many times ever since. I'd say this is the best, most authentic nasi padang you can get in Sg. Any more authentic, please head to Changi Airport & get on a flight. Hah~  What's good? Basically the black coloured crispy beef lung is yummy, the ayam goreng with bumbu is awesome, sayur nangka! I am salivating as I write this.  Beef rendang is not too bad, except it is not tender enough. There are the other usual ayam gulai (must get the gulai sauce for your rice)!, chilli eggs, etc.  I was surprised to see a line on Sat afternoon, but yeah there is a queue at times. I was more than willing to jump into the queue. What's best is to come in the evening and they still have food!  If not for the calories that come with the meal, I will choose this over salad any day, any time!"

Three Buns,4.4,11,"Burgers, Cocktail Bars",4,13-Feb-23,"Super solid burger! I'm celiac so was delighted to see a protein style (bunless) option on the menu! Only compliant was they don't have a separate fryer to make their fries gluten free. Definitely had a little fomo watching my friends enjoy, hoping next time we're back in Singapore that will change.  Ooh and I almost forgot! Was stoked to see a vegan milkshake option (made w oatmilk)"
Three Buns,4.4,11,"Burgers, Cocktail Bars",5,14-Mar-19,"Impossible Foods. This is the reason my husband and I ventured to Three Buns for a late Sunday lunch. There are two Impossible Foods burgers on the extensive burger menu of this burger based restaurant.  For the uninitiated, Impossible Foods is a US based company that makes plant-based replacement foods for meat and dairy. Impossible Foods goal is to make delicious foods that have the benefit of meat, but not the negative health benefits on humans and negative environmental associated with livestock products.  In short, it is the chance for people like me that do not eat red meat, to enjoy what is supposed to be the most closest thing to meat I can get. So I was intrigued about the idea of enjoying a big juicy hamburger...albeit all made of plants. And not a disappointment.  Three Buns is a cool place. It has super cool music playing like People Under the Stairs & Souls of Mischief. Seating both inside and out, one space spills into the other, tables are wooden or table top at a bar, the place feels super local and has a play area for kids right out front. We saw girls here for brunch, we say families with little kids and we saw couples like us. The vibe is minimal, friendly, environmentally friendly.  This was my first Impossible Foods experience, for it is new to Singapore, although sprinkled around a few restaurants on the island. My plant based burger came at a price...a whopping $27 price tag for the burger alone. Worth every penny! This plant based burger looks like a hamburger...juicy drippings, soft meaty texture, delicious! A meat eater might not know the difference. The burger itself is not giant, but it was absolutely tasty...from the bun, to the sauce, to the Impossible plant-based burger itself! I would pay $27 to consume it again. Now a meat eater would most likely not agree because the price might be intimidating, but for we pescatarians or anyone seeking a healthier option...this burger rocks!  Coupled with some truffle cheese fries, a milkshake and a tentative friendly staff, I think Three Buns is the bomb! Simple, easy, plant-based, local, cool."
Three Buns,4.4,11,"Burgers, Cocktail Bars",4,15-Nov-20,"Probably the best milkshakes i have had in singapore. Very good burgers and fries. Slightly pricey, but worth the try for impossible burgers and milkshakes!"
Three Buns,4.4,11,"Burgers, Cocktail Bars",5,1-Oct-19,"The burgers were sooo good I didn't get a chance to take a picture! They are a tad on the smaller size- be warned. However, they have so much flavor! Get the chili fries- nice kick. This place is delicious don't sleep on it !!"
Three Buns,4.4,11,"Burgers, Cocktail Bars",4,7-May-19,"Not a bad burger for Singapore. No draft beer. Service was prompt and attentive. No issue there. Food came out really fast. Only a few sips of my beer and boom, food was there. Had a salad, fries and a burger. Burger was a bit under done for me, but they didn't ask how I would like it cooked. Overall flavor was good. Salad and fries also good. Would come back again. But specify how you want your burger cooked.  If they brought the food out slower, I would have had more beer."
Three Buns,4.4,11,"Burgers, Cocktail Bars",4,15-Nov-19,"This little restaurant has a good view of the river but also close to the kids playground, so you can watch the kiddos while enjoying Happy hour from 5-8! The burgers are quite good and I even enjoyed the Impossible burgers! The service was good and the prices are not bad for singapore. The only negative side was the burger size was a bit smaller than what I am used to but not enough to keep me from visiting again!!"

And before I knew it, burger and fries to the table, causing me to wonder if the burger or patty was cooked ahead. Tasty food, burger cooked medium. I'd come back again."
Three Buns,4.4,11,"Burgers, Cocktail Bars",3,13-Nov-19,Great. The songs suitable with the environment and it comforts me hanging out here with my friends. The price quite cheap and it tastes good. Brilliant.
Pu Dong Kitchen,3.4,7,Shanghainese,1,15-Jun-23,"oh boy, where to start. The dumplings, which is the simplest staple food, tasted like they were frozen from days of cultural revolution. I had 2 out of the 10, the 2nd one was purely out of curiosity on how can dumplings be sooo bad. the friend dumplings, which is the reason i came, was soaked in oil and topped with so much sesame seeds, its gross and just entirely murdering a shanghai specialty. I guess Pudong is just not like the ones from Pu Xi, very peasantly."
Pu Dong Kitchen,3.4,7,Shanghainese,4,6-Sep-15,"What I ALWAYS eat here:  1) Shen Jian Bao - We always end up ordering 2 orders minimum. Even when there are 2 or 3 of us. Er..it's a real guilty pleasure..but so yummy the guilt only sets in later. Piping hot, be very careful. It's recommended (by my friend who got the inside of her nose burned by hot spurting juices) to poke a little hole at the top. Let the steam out. You can slowly suck some of the juices out but..seriously do yourself a favour and put it down for awhile. Let it come down a few degrees. The only have this on weekends.  2) Xiao Long Bao - real comforting bags of tasty soup. Big on the soup volume. My friend says that Din Tai Fung has a more refined taste but here it's pure comfort food and really tasty.  Other than that, dishes I recommend are:  1) Zha Jiang Mian - a tad sweet. Nice chewy noodles. Bit of meat. This is nicely balanced and not too gluey or tomatoey like some Chinese places.  2) Shui Jiao - boiled dumplings with Jiu Cai (9 vegetable/chives).  3) Braised eggplant with chilli and minced meat.  4) Onion Chive Pancake - SO crispy and tasty. Eat with plenty of vinegar.  5) Claypot fishhead - We always used to see lots of people ordering this and finally when I brought my family and had enough people I got to try it. Fishhead but surprisingly meaty. The brown sauce is tasty although it may look a bit plebian.  6) The winter melon soup - Actually I don't order this but my friend is ALWAYS insisting to have it saying it's so comforting. It's kinda salty but I think after a busy morning riding horses, we all could do with some electrolyte replacement.  Some dishes are quite pricey here but stick to the dumplings and zha jian mian and you will be quite happy without spending too much."
Pu Dong Kitchen,3.4,7,Shanghainese,4,18-Sep-12,"Do not go there for great d¨¦cor or ambiance. Go there for great tasting pork. Excellent Shanghainese joint. Try the braised pork shoulder with brown sauce, the pork belly, the pig's ear. Well, it's all about the pork. We also ordered a fish soup that comes into a huge clay pot. Delicious but you have to order it in advance.  Go for the pork!!!"
Pu Dong Kitchen,3.4,7,Shanghainese,4,10-Mar-13,"I lived in Shanghai for awhile and unlike most Singaporeans, am rather taken by the confusing array of flavors that the Shanghainese seem to enjoy. Saccharine meat, shengjianbao, xiaolongbao etc. This place is a gem! I am glad I was introduced to it.  The ambiance is dingy, and reminds me of has-been Chinese wedding restaurants. But the deliciously authentic food supersedes all its flaws!  Price point: $100 for 3, no drinks."
Pu Dong Kitchen,3.4,7,Shanghainese,3,27-Dec-13,"My uncle told me about this place at the basement of Balmoral Plaza. He mentioned ""authentic Shanghainese"", ""speak Shanghainese to the lao ban niang"" and ""value for money"". Well the dude and I decided to go check this place out since we can never say no to Shanghai dumplings and translating the quintessential ""shi zhi tou"" to English. If you've lived in Shanghai for a bit as an expat you'll know what I mean.  The restaurant has every bit the vibe of an American Chinese restaurant. Dinky carpet, front of house lady in her China-made jacket and expedient, but not necessarily super polite service. Love it. Pudong Kitchen serves up a pretty authentic menu but prices are higher than say Huayi Kitchen at International building. This is Bukit Timah though so I'm willing to overlook that if the food is good. We had the xiao long bao and guotie and they were both very good. It's not as refined as the masterly dumpling folders at Din Tai Fung, but each dumpling was bursting with soup (or sauce in the case of the guotie) and steaming hot. I also liked the zhajiang mian and qie zi (eggplant) we ordered though portions are quite large, so perhaps it's best to bring friends along like you would to most Chinese restaurants. Finally, we wanted to try something interesting and we ordered the minced pork with egg white and milk. It was quite a mild dish and without knowing much about how it's 'supposed' to taste, I wished it had more of a porky kick and some seasoning. Nonethless, it's quite a clean protein dish if you're looking for one.  I will probably come back once to try the lion's head and other funky dishes with weird English translations because back in the day while we were in Shanghai, we didn't have the luxury of a dish explanation like you do on the Pudong menu. I think this is a fail safe, neighborhood restaurant option and the value works out if you have more than 2 people sharing a few dishes."
Pu Dong Kitchen,3.4,7,Shanghainese,4,15-May-15,Stopped in for an impromptu lunch and was thoroughly pleased with their authentic menu. Service and atmosphere weren't stellar but that's not why you visit a place like this. Will visit again for sure. ~$60 for two pax.
Lim Joo Hin Eating House,,,,5,5-Feb-15,"The Teochew Porridge Chronicles: Part 3  So after trying out the 2 teochew porridges at Upper Bukit Timah, it was time to revisit an old favourite, Lim Joo Hin Eat House at Havelock Road.  We took some time off this place because we felt that they were getting overpriced but going back there reminded us of why we loved it to start with.  Minced pork After the last 2 disappointments, this brought back the satisfaction we had missed in our last 2 teochew porridge visits. Unlike the last 2 places, Lim Joo Hin uses a great mix of fat and minced meat, thus ensuring that the mince is juicy. The bean or bean paste used is perfect too, giving it a nice aroma without it being overly salty.  Salted Egg These salted eggs are as perfect as they get. Not cooked to death, the yolks are still soft and not dry and powdery.  Large Intestines Definitely the best intestines among the 3. Soft and ""bouncy"", the intestines are cleaned and cooked to perfection.  Steamed egg While it doesn't look like much, these eggs are actually beautifully steamed. Melts in your mouth and not overly salted, the eggs are always a favourite!  Braised Chicken Feet Quite often, this dish is either not cooked long enough (causing the skin to be chewy) or the flavours are not quite right. This one is very well cooked with the flavours are pretty good too! Sort of reminds you of those from a good Tim sum restaurant!  Overall, the food here is still very good. They take pride in ensuring that their items are not overcooked and the flavours are well balanced. Only set back is that at $21.50 for 5 dishes, 2 porridge, a rice and a drink, this might not be the cheapest Teochew Porridge in Singapore, but it certainly is one of the nicer ones.  Comfort food at its best!"
Lim Joo Hin Eating House,,,,5,25-Dec-12,"thought I'd save my Christmas review for something truly special - so here's my gift for you all!  Rockstar Teochew porridge - simple, tasty, and not expensive, plus it's open till late!  I've been here almost once a week for the last month now, and I can't get enough of it. Make sure you get the fishcake, braised duck, beancurd skin, salted vegetables, and... I could go on, but the list is really kinda long. I'd start with this lot, and make my way down the row of ""point-to-order"" dishes.  The beauty of this food is that it is such comfort food material, and every time I go there, the food always puts a smile on my mouth, and joy in my belly.  Sit outside by the street, and you get the best view of everyone who comes by too, from the uncles with young girlfriends, to the old dudes catching up with other old dudes over porridge and the day's gossip papers. It's a good place to be."
Lim Joo Hin Eating House,,,,1,27-Apr-16,"Expensive coffeeshop food and very rude service.  Lim Joo Hin serves 2 star food but the staff are brusque and act as though they are doing you a favor by serving you. We visited several times hoping that we just had an usually bad experience, but I can report that the bad attitude is chronic here.  The food is good at times but very inconsistent....sometimes it's not warm or seasoned (salt) enough, sometimes over seasoned.  Finally, the prices are unconscionable. They have an air conditioned dining room available next door (don't try to order from there, you may get yelled at), and they think that this entitles them to charge full restaurant prices for a sub-par coffeeshop experience."
Lim Joo Hin Eating House,,,,5,14-Sep-12,"The best Teochew food on a block known for their old school chinese restaurants and elderly locals. The staff doesn't speak english, but don't let that stop you from the point and smile method of ordering.  I love walking by late at night . The lambo is parked out front and crowd of women dressed in their best tight, faux-Herv¨¦ L¨¦ger bandage dresses and men in their suits crowd around the plastic tables that line the street, eating off of bright yellow plates with their red plastic chopsticks.  This place is Singapore."
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",5,18-Aug-19,"What an incredible find just outside the frantic Orchard Blvd area. Conveniently located across from Tanglin Mall and easily accessible by foot, bus, or taxi. A short 20 minute walk from Tang Plaza MRT.  Food, service, and atmosphere were top notch this evening. Menu consists of classics from the heart of Tuscany to the Almafi coast. Pizza, pasta, fish, meat , and salads are all represented.  The complimentary bruschetta was excellent. Instead of a thick slice of traditional baguette, they use more of a local crisped flat bread topped with seasoned chopped tomatoes and herbs. I could eat a whole plate myself.  Their Frito misto is not one that will soon be forgotten. fresh and flavorful prawns, local fish, and calamari lightly fried. Accompanied by garlic aioli and a vibrant marinara sauce. Fantastic appetizer.  Caprese was so much better than I was expecting because I haven't seen a decent tomato since I arrived in Singapore. This place is the exception. Deep red ripened tomatoes, soft mozzarella, basil and extra virgin olive oil. Very enjoyable.  For our main we shared a pizza Margherita. Expertly fired, thin Neapolitan style crust, simply topped with red sauce, mozzarella , and basil.  Excellent desserts available, but we chose a liquid option to finish things off. Grappa Nonino and Amaro Montenegro rounded things off for us. Outstanding.  Attentive servers, expansive outdoor seating, and excellent food make this a top choice for Italian fare in Singapore."
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",4,6-Jul-19,"Simple, well done, southern-Italian food. If I don't feel like cooking, this is the next best thing! Nice location, good service, and all considered fairly priced (for Singapore, in this neighborhood...)"
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",4,11-Dec-12,"Am giving it a four star cos I didn't had enough time to try their dessert but I'm pretty sure this is a five star restaurant.  My friend and I had about an hour to spare for dinner before rushing off to a nearby venue to catch a performance. It was a wet and dreary friday evening around 630pm. The restaurant was actually pretty empty but the atmosphere was still warm and cosy cos of the lighting and deco.  We quickly ordered our mains and didn't had the time for any appetizers nor dessert due to the rush but we thoroughly enjoyed our mains!  Upon our order, a complimentary appetizer was served. Dont really know what's in it but its on a slice of crispy bread and it tastes great.  Our mains were fantastic too. I ordered seafood pasta and my friend, a beef baked pasta. The portion was large and the ingredients were generous. Totally worth the price that we're paying. We left feeling a little sad cos we didnt had time to try the dessert, would have loved to spend more time enjoying our food and try more stuff.  Would make a point to go there again!"
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",4,5-Jul-14,"We came here to celebrate a birthday. It's slightly upmarket - a still or sparkling water kind of place. We had a fairly attentive waiter, though he did once miss refilling our glasses.  Don't be put off by the relatively high price of the appetisers, the portions are correspondingly generous. Our pastas and pizzas were all well done. Not too salty, very fresh and comfortingly homely.  Overall, quite satisfying but slightly pricey."
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",5,29-Apr-18,Food was delicious. Prices reasonable. Staff were quite nice. Would readily recommend.
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",5,23-Mar-15,"This seemed like a legitimate Southern Italian trattoria. The food was all fresh and simple. The seafood stew was great and about $12 cheaper than the normal ~$30 it tends to cost elsewhere (e.g. Pasta Brava). The spaghetti amatriciana was very nice. The best thing was the ribeye steak though with mushrooms and potatoes, which was extremely well seasoned and cooked and seemed like a lot of food. This is easily the best steak I have seen in Singapore at that price point. They also have gelato from Alfero, which is amazing. I will probably bring my family here when they visit.  Service was a little avoidant but the food was good enough to make up for it. Only real shocker when the bill came was that the focaccia (pizza bianca) cost $12.80. It was really good and possibly worth it, but that is disproportionately expensive relative to the other items."
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",3,15-Dec-14,"There is a chill in the air when it comes to service at this restaurant.  Dined on a Saturday around 7:20pm slightly ahead of our reservation time. . As it was early the dining room was empty. We were seated quickly and provided menus. A female member of the wait staff asked if we wanted a beverage. WE ARE NON DRINKERS so we said water would be fine.  The waiter comes over to our table and my partner and I ordered Tortelloni and Lasagna for our mains. Again we were asked if we wanted wine or cocktaI with our meals. Again we politely stated water would be fine and that we would be adding dessert at the end.  The decision of no wine or cocktail did not sit well with our server. He took a bottle off the table and presented our order to the kitchen. Food arrived promptly but no follow up from our server.  There were additional staff on the floor whose jobs it seems was to wisk plates off the table but all it felt like, as a customer, was rushed service. THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC. It is a shame that all the effort is offset at the front of the house.  When we finished our entres we decided to close out our check and leave as fast as we could. We went up the street for an after dinner coffee and dessert. We did hear a few voices saying good night on our way out of the door.  This was our second time visiting this dining spot. The first time was a late night coffee and dessert. That time also the food was very good but the reception staff was short and unwelcoming.  Twice is enough for Lafiandra. There are alot of excellent mid priced Italian eateries in Singapore to spend our money.  A word of note to wait staff. We were two business men dining with company support. Support does not mean they cover wine and spirits. That is okay by use as we are former spirit consumers. I know it lends to a lower check but we should not be made to feel less than welcome because of it."
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",4,6-Mar-16,"Greeted by a lovely Italian waitress the moment I walked in. Love the environment. Can be quite crowded on a Friday night. I suggest you make reservations.  Ordered one of their baked pasta (good), garlic bread (good), salad (good), and risotto (quite bland after having all the other flavorful dishes).  One of the waitress doesn't look that happy though. But overall, loved that place."
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",5,9-Feb-18,"Outstanding Italian food, service was impeccable and prices were SG reasonable. First time there tonight and we will be back as other SG Italian restaurants do not even compare! Nice job!"
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",5,15-Feb-15,Ate here for Valentine Day dinner. Nice italian restaurant. Air cond. Located in Singapore Art Museum building. Good salads and appetizers. After meal drinks. Service was fine. Probably best restaurant we ate at.
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",5,26-Jan-14,"My favourite local Italian place in SG for reasonably priced no fuss Italian.  The pizzas are authentic, huge, and great value, registering at between $20-25. Easily enough for two people to share. Pastas similarly great servings and consistently well done. My favourite is their Spaghetti Mariana , which is generous in its amounts of seafood.  Nice ambiance inside, and especially outside at the museum. Wine is OK, well priced."
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",5,20-Jul-19,"Very friendly service, gave great recommendations. Garlic bread was fantastic. We got pasta with clams and pasta with prawns, both tasted amazing, and I got a lot of clams. And we finished it of with tartufo affogato, rounding out a fantastic meal."
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",5,5-Jan-17,"Fabulous food, first class service especially from our waiter, whose name sadly I didn't get, who went above and beyond what we asked and very well priced. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for an excellent Italian meal"
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",5,19-Jun-15,"Classically made pizzas; nice thin crust. Had the Hawaii which was really good, maybe a tad heavy on the cheese - which I'm completely fine with. Allowed us to get a table a little before opening hours for dinner, which was quite nice from the heat."
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",3,26-Jan-16,"Was excited to check it out based on reviews. Currently in India for work, 9months, so attempting to get as much good food in as possible. I arrived at 10:10 and was told the kitchen was closed. Restaurant closes at 11. Maybe it's normal to close the kitchen that early, but seemed odd. I was old I could have lasagna or pizza, so picked the former. It was pretty good, but would have preferred marinara sauce vs the cheese sauce it came with. Also, closing an hour in advance wasn't awesome. Would recommend based on what I had access to."
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",1,26-Feb-17,Beyond Horrible. Service was atrocious. Food was over salted. Feedback was uncared for. Terrible.
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",5,9-Aug-14,My absolute favorite restaurant in Singapore! Love the food! Love the owners! Excellent service! It's a must try hidden gem!
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",2,11-May-14,"When we arrived we ignored for a very long time. Even when we grabbed someone they were reluctant to serve us...they said the kitchen was very busy. Clearly they don't understand that, even if the kitchen is busy, you acknowledge your customers. We ordered the Caprese salad, knowing it was a gamble as the quality of tomatoes in Singapore is very poor. I figured a nice Italian Trattoria would figure out how to get good tomatoes, but no, the tomatoes were even worse than you find in Fair Price. The pasta took a long time coming due to the slow kitchen, and was not bad, but not fantastic."
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",5,3-Aug-15,"One of my favourite Italian restaurants in Asia. The pizza bread/tomato appetiser is wonderful. Their house wines are always excellent. The location is in a classic, colonial building adjacent to the Singapore art museum. The big rumour is the owner teaches other chefs in Singapore on the secrets of Italian cooking."
Trattoria Lafiandra,4.1,20,"Italian, Wine Bars",1,15-May-14,"Probable racist chef-owner refused to serve me water with my pizza!  My wife and I went there after a film at SAM. My wife is African American, I am Anglo-Chinese. We ordered a pizza, two desserts and a drink, but when I tried to order plain tap water, the waitress insisted i order sparking imported water. I referred to the fact that everyone else in the restaurant was drinking regular Singapore tap water. After some back and forth I said if I can't have water with my pizza I would have to leave. She asked the chef who told us to get out and made an aggressive gesture of dismissal. I don't fully understand Italian hand gestures, but there is no doubt it was highly disrespectful.  What makes me think this was motivated by racism was the fact that everyone else in the restaurant (all white or Asian) had water, much of which was tap water.  When my wife confronted Chef Cataldo, he couldn't make eye contact with her and blurted out something about how he couldn't afford to wash water glasses. He complained that this was because the Singapore government (MOM) had refused to let him hire foreign dishwashers. However, I think the disrespectful way he treated us is likely due to his racism.  I can't comment on the food or value since we never got to eat our meal."
Katong Keah Kee,4.5,2,"Seafood, Specialty Food, Street Vendors",4,15-Jan-17,"The oyster pancake here is inbetween Chaozhou and Taiwanese styles. Some parts are more gelatinous, other parts are more doughy and eggy. Tasty overall.  The pancake did not taste overly greasy although I think it was missing a touch of seasoning. You can watch the food get fried to order, and there was a serious line of customers so I think the cook was rushing. As a result, I'm pretty sure the oysters in my pancake were 95% uncooked, which is not my personal preference but may also be Singaporean style. For example, I know they like to serve medium rare cockles on a lot of dishes.  Either way, hopefully your oysters will be cooked to a bit more firm because I think the weather here is a bit too warm to be serving these oysters completely raw. They didn't have the firmness of a really freshly shucked half shell. That said, I also didn't get food poisoning despite my weak stomach so that speaks to the santitation and freshness standards here.  The chili sauce is definitely useful, and it's less sweet than a lot of Singaporean chili sauces I've had."
Katong Keah Kee,4.5,2,"Seafood, Specialty Food, Street Vendors",5,8-Apr-14,"I was in Asia for nearly a month gorging on everything from xiaolong bao to durian... dining at hawker food stalls to fancy chili crab restaurants recommended by locals. The one dish I couldn't get enough of was the oyster omelet.  Oyster omelet is called 'Orh Lua' in Singapore. Originated from the Teochew fried oyster omelet. From what I read, the owner of this newly renovated stall is Uncle Law who has been frying these for nearly 50 years. He comes from a family that specializes in orh lua, having different stalls under different logos around Singapore.  Singapore is a foodie's heaven! One of my fondest memories of childhood travels is eating oyster omelet with my mom while visiting one of my grandfather's projects in China. Katong Keah's omelet was the first one I had that was comparable to the delicious fluffy eggs and fresh oysters I remember. Oyster Omelet here is full of fluffy eggs, light crispy on the outside, with fresh plump oysters on top. All smiles!"
